== Docs Component Configuration

This repository contains an Antora docs component.
Keep in mind these key repository features:

* Component name, version, and start page are configured in each branch's _antora.yml_ file.
* The navigation for all Server modules, including those aggregated from other repositories, is stored in the ROOT module's _nav.adoc_ file.
* Server documentation modules are also aggregated from the {url-cli}[Couchbase CLI], {url-backup}[Couchbase Enterprise Backup Client], and {url-analytics}[Couchbase Analytics] repositories.
* Production branches use the *release/X.Y* naming pattern (e.g., release/5.5, release/6.0).
 ** The {url-playbook}[docs site playbook] instructs Antora to automatically aggregate any branch names that start with *release/*.

== Documentation Site Toolchain

The documentation source files are marked up with AsciiDoc.
Once merged into a version branch, the source files and their assets are aggregated, converted to HTML, and published by Antora to our staging and production sites.
The docs components and {url-ui}[site UI] are orchestrated by the {url-playbook}[docs site playbook].
See the contributing guide to learn more.
