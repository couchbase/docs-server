[#new-features-improvements-662]
=== New Features and Improvements 

This section highlights the notable new features and improvements in this release.

* The minimum TLS version has been set to 1.2 on port 21150.

* Improved failover processing time seen as a result of pipeline processing of vBuckets during failover instead of sequential processing.

* Improvements in the Eventing Service 
** Supports binary documents in addition to JSON documents.  Binary documents are only sent to Functions having a language compatibility setting of 6.6.2 or above.
** The Feed Boundary or "dcp_stream_boundary" is no longer selected at deployment time but part of the Function's configuration.
** Provides the ability to adjust context size for timers using the setting `Timer Context Max Size` on the Admin UI.

* Improvements in the Search service 
** Enables cluster level managerOptions to be persistent and available across the nodes.
** Enables configuring the rebalance concurrency knob runtime using the `MaxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode` setting.
** Enables overriding the `maxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode` parameter to N as a runtime cluster option, thereby speeding up the rebalance operation.

=== Known Issues

This section highlights the notable known issues in this release.

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v662-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

|  https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44993[MB-44993^]
| *Summary*: In the following syntax the `link_dataverse_name` is optional. 
+
----
CREATE EXTERNAL DATASET ds_dataverse_name?.ds_name 
    ON ...
    AT link_dataverse_name?.link_name
----
+
If the `link_dataverse_name` is not specified, it incorrectly defaults to the Default dataverse (or the dataverse provided by a prior USE statement).

*Workaround*: Specify the `link_dataverse_name` explicitly when creating external datasets.

|  https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44986[MB-44986^]
| *Summary*: A dataset that was created using a filter that contains an IN or a NOT IN predicate (such as the example shown below) results in an error on executing the corresponding CONNECT LINK statement.
+
----
CREATE DATASET dataset ON bucket WHERE field NOT IN ['value1', 'value2'];
----

*Workaround*: Reformulate the CREATE DATASET statement to avoid IN or NOT IN predicates, for example:
+
----
CREATE DATASET dataset ON bucket WHERE field <> 'value1' and field <> 'value2'; 
----

=== Fixed Issues

This section highlights the notable issues fixed in this release. 

[#table_fixedissues_v662-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43632[MB-43632^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the RBAC user was unable to access the web console when creating an Analytics dataset and the user did not have the `Analytics Admin` role.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42573[MB-42573^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a server 500 error when running an Analytics query with more than one join.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42305[MB-42305^]
| *Summary*: Falling back from using TLS for remote link authentication to using SCRAM-SHA has been fixed.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v662-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40375[MB-40375^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a rare condition where a hard or unsafe failover caused the preconditions to be checked more than once.
|===

==== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_v662-xdcr,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44182[MB-44182^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a rare case of XDCR TCP connection leaks when the host did not respond  and ended up taking up all the file descriptors of a system. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44131[MB-44131^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an XMEM connection leak when pipeline start timed out.
|===


==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v662-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44832[MB-44832^]
| *Summary*: Disconnecting in the middle of a replica backfill could cause the replication connection to be torn down if the connection between the prepare seqno of an abort and the abort itself was disconnected. The replication stream was unable to progress until the abort had been overwritten or purged (duration of the metadata purge interval). This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44534[MB-44534^]
| *Summary*: The SetWithMeta MCBP operation allowed storing empty documents with invalid datatypes. This has been fixed by sanitizing the payload and the datatype is set to RAW as per KV invariant.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44079[MB-44079^]
| *Summary*: Ephemeral item purging may not be done in seqno order as we iterate HashTable buckets rather than the Ephemeral sequence list. As such, it's possible for the commit of a durable write to be purged before the corresponding prepare. If a replica vBucket received a prepare without the corresponding commit then it would attempt to recommit the prepare if the vBucket was promoted to active. This causes montonicity exceptions to be thrown on the new active vBucket and any replica vBucket which did receive the corresponding commit.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43717[MB-43717^], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41406[MB-41406^]
| *Summary*: Potential race in background task removing stale data from Ephemeral buckets.

The StaleItemDeleter task updated an iterator which is read by incoming KV operations, without taking the appropriate lock to ensure exclusive access.
This issue is believed to be rare and has only been seen during data race analysis; no failures resulting from this issue have been identified in a full Couchbase Server instance.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42918[MB-42918^]
| *Summary*: If a durable write is performed via INSERT (Add), an existing item may be removed from the hash table if it was deleted and not yet persisted. Another client performing a GET could trigger a fetch of the item from disk, and the returned item could be the logical predecessor of the unpersisted DELETE that was removed from the hash table if it had not yet been persisted. This means that the client would not be able to read their own write. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42610[MB-42610^]
| *Summary*: If a replica vBucket was promoted to active having only received a partial backfill (a data loss scenario), then a subsequent expiration of an item could expire a pending durable write if it had the same CAS. This caused any future lookups or writes to that key to cause memcached to crash. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42607[MB-42607^]
| *Summary*: During TLS handshake with the Data Service, if the node certificate required more than 8192 bytes to transmit, then the handshake would fail. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41407[MB-41407^]
| *Summary*: Potential crash during eviction for Ephemeral bucket with nruEviction configured.

The crash is a result of a race condition leading to heap use after free. This issue is believed to be rare and has only been seen during data race analysis.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41300[MB-41300^]
| *Summary*: Fixing a potential issue where sanity checks may trigger at Replica and cause a crash when the node receives temporary mutations for Sync Replication.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38444[MB-38444^]
| *Summary*: A DCP Producer on an ephemeral bucket may encode a wrong EndSeqno in the SnapshotMarker for disk snapshots. That was a rare situation that might cause DCP clients to see an inconsistency between what is declared in the marker and what is received in the actual snapshot. This has been fixed.
|===


==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v662-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44637[MB-44637^]
| *Summary*: Duplicate mutations were possible due to a race condition during eventing node rebalance. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44016[MB-44016^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a performance issue causing timeouts when using the REST API to get Eventing status. This issue occurred on high (20+) Function deployment counts.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43762[MB-43762^]
| *Summary*: The Feed Boundary or "dcp_stream_boundary" is no longer selected at deployment time. The value is configured via the Admin UI (or REST API) to either "Everything" or "From now" as a persistent setting per Function.  This prevents accidental deployments on the incorrect Feed Boundary.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43365[MB-43365^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where Event handlers hung in the deploying state following a rebalance failure.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43364[MB-43364^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the metadata bucket was not cleared even when all handlers were undeployed from the paused state.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42804[MB-42804^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where Eventing service did not throw an inter handler recursion error when the same handler with the same binding was deployed via the REST API.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42498[MB-42498^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where a function was stuck in the deploying state when a bucket was deleted and rebalance was triggered.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42497[MB-42497^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a race condition between undeploy and vBucket restream on rollback which resulted in a panic.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38403[MB-38403^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue  to close N1QL iterators at time of garbage collection to free up resources where the user forgot to close them. 
|===


==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v662-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45541[MB-45541^]
| *Summary*: A stale vBucket map in projector caused stale=false scans to timeout during KV rebalance. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44409[MB-44409^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the DDLServiceMgr took a long time to build a partitioned index with replica.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43959[MB-43959^]
| *Summary*: The cluster info cache refresh has been optimized by querying the buckets.uri endpoint only on a change in version hash.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43766[MB-43766^]
| *Summary*: The index build tokens were cleaned up only during rebalance. This has been updated so the index build tokens are cleaned up periodically on index deletion and by the lifecycle manager's janitor as well.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43764[MB-43764^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the partition index order was not honored when index projection included all keys and the document key.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43280[MB-43280^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where `listReplicaCount` took more than 10s and timed out.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43072[MB-43072^]
| Fixed a delay in the connectBucket function that caused the indexer to projector connection time out. 
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_v662-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45273[MB-45273^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the primary index scan was incorrectly used with query containing an OR condition.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44979[MB-44979^]
| *Summary*: Connections that timeout on read are now discarded.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44331[MB-44331^]

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43488[MB-43488^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where an adaptive index with UNNEST alias returned wrong results.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43384[MB-43384^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where setupSSL() failed and impacted query execution.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43301[MB-43301^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue wherein copying a document internally wasn't done correctly.
In case of UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE using UPDATE or DELETE, it could result in data loss by deleting a wrong document. In case of JOIN, LET, and UNNEST, it could return incorrect results if we were joining on meta().id or projecting meta().id.
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_fixedissues_v662-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44485[MB-44485^]

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v661-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43272[MB-43272^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing Metadata bucket is not being cleared when handlers are undeployed from the paused state. If the handler is using timers, this can also result in timers not being removed as expected, that can then fire and execute on a subsequent deployment.  

*Workaround*: Do not undeploy handlers from the paused state in version 6.6.1.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43343[MB-43343^]
| *Summary*: Handlers can hang in the deploying state due to a race condition during rebalance-in of an Eventing node if more than one function has the same source bucket in version 6.6.1.

*Workaround*: Ensure that you pause handlers before any rebalance.

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40727[MB-40727^]
| *Summary*: After upgrading to 6.6.1 a rebalance might be required to repair composite secondary indexes that contain NULL or MISSING.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40693[MB-40693^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Analytics service threw an error when creating a link from an IPv4 configured cluster to an IPv6 configured cluster.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40576[MB-40576^]
| *Summary*: If an identifier for a metadata entity (e.g. a dataverse or a dataset) contained characters that require URL encoding (percent-encoding) when used in a URI, requests that used this identifier failed with an URISyntaxException. This has been fixed.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v661-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41183[MB-41183^]
| *Summary*: For audit events from memcached, "peername" and "sockname" have been renamed to "local" and "remote" with the syntax: {"ip":"hostname","port":1234}.
|===

==== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41866[MB-41866^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an infinite loop due to HdrHistogram being reset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41089[MB-41089^]
| *Summary*: The HTCleaner in Ephemeral is responsible for purging tombstones and also Completed (Committed / Aborted) SyncWrites. A bug in that component led to removing in-flight SyncWrites from internal data-structures, which would cause a crash on the node when/if it tried to complete the SyncWrite.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42167[MB-42167^]
| *Summary*: The `api/v1/list/functions` returned incorrect list of handler names. This has been fixed by updating the bucket function map after storing in the primary store.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41940[MB-41940^]
| *Summary*: The Web Console UI did not display the very first line of Eventing logs and has been fixed. (Note that the logs files in the file system contained the correct information without any truncation). 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41509[MB-41509^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Eventing debugger crashed when using toLocaleString in JS.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41091[MB-41091^]
| *Summary*: The debugger link has been updated, from `chrome-devtools://` to `devtools://`,  to adapt to different Chrome versions.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40945[MB-40945^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an exception thrown when data sent in the request body to deploy a handler was null. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40731[MB-40731^]
| *Summary*: Fixed the function handler so that a paused handler can only be resumed using `/resume`. Previously, it was possible to resume a paused handler using `/deploy`.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40637[MB-40637^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where upon upgrading from version 6.0.x to 6.6, a handler that uses N1qlQuery would stop working on nodes that were upgraded and threw an error (`ReferenceError: N1qlQuery is not defined`) when it hit the line that calls N1qlQuery. With this fix, handlers will continue to work the same way in older and newer nodes.  

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40636[MB-40636^]
| *Summary*: Improved automation of failover handling in Eventing service in several scenarios.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40522[MB-40522^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where delete mutation on a `src` bucket from OnUpdate() was not suppressed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40518[MB-40518^]
| *Summary*: Eventing service was not retrying bucket ops failures that were retryable like ETMPFAIL that could be retried. This has been fixed and will now retry until the script timeout.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40357[MB-40357^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue so that a function action does not deploy and execute on mutations after a REST API validation error.
|===

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v661-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43231[MB-43231^]
| *Summary*: Starting with version 6.5.0, VbSeqnosReader has been updated to process two types of requests: VbSeqnosRequest and VbMinSeqnosRequest. When processing VbSeqnosRequest, if there are any VbMinSeqnosRequest's, then the VbMinSeqnosRequest's will be queued back into the requestCh of VbSeqnosReader. However, if the VbSeqnosReader closed by this time, then enqueue would fail and the caller would be waiting for a response indefinitely. This has been fixed to respond to outstanding requests upon exit of VbSeqnosReader.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42614[MB-42614^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where rebalance failed due to timestamp mismatch between snapshots.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42108[MB-42108^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where multiple partition tombstones for an index during rebalance could lead to partition cleanup on restart.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41722[MB-41722^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue in the waitForIndexBuild routine which caused it not to terminate at the end of the batch and remain active till the end of rebalance. As a result, rebalance caused a very large number of TIME_WAIT connections and subsequently failed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41673[MB-41673^]
| *Summary*: Added per index `memory_used` statistic to the `api/v1/stats` endpoint to enable memory accounting.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41672[MB-41672^]
| *Summary*: The statistic `pauseTotalNs` has been added to the `api/v1/stats` endpoint and enables you to monitor any spikes in GC between two intervals. `PauseTotalNs` is a cumulative statistic that represents the total time an indexer process has been paused for GC since it's inception.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41645[MB-41645^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the gsi index resident ratio showed a value greater than 100% due to num_rec_swapin being larger than num_rec_swapout (num_rec_swapin > num_rec_swapout). This is a rare and transient condition that may occur sometimes as the stats are updated asynchronously and will become correct eventually.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41641[MB-41641^]
| *Summary*: Improved array indexing performance by optimizing the ComputeArrayEntriesWithCount method.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41717[MB-41717^]
| *Summary*: When bloomDelta is added after recovery when page is found without a bloom filter, the stat NumRecordAllocs is over counted. However, NumRecordAllocs is only supposed to track the insert/delete deltas. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41155[MB-41155^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue with memory optimized indexes where indefinite disk snapshotting led to increasing disk usage.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40127[MB-40127^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a memory growth issue observed when processing many metadata operations.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40120[MB-40120^]
| *Summary*: Log replay will skip data blocks if a more recent header was already recovered by checkpoint recovery. When skipping the stale data blocks, page op stats due to that stale data block were not being cleared and the stats kept accumulating. This caused incorrect stats for PageBytes and ItemCnt after recovery. This has been fixed by discarding page ops stats during log replay.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-MB-42079[MB-42079^]
| *Summary*: On Windows, when upgrading to 6.6.1 or later from any earlier version, configuration changes such as custom data directories may be lost. To avoid this, before running the MSI installer, copy the file `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\etc\runtime.ini` to a new file named `runtime{{.ini-hold}}` in the same directory. This path may be different if you installed Server into a non-standard directory.

[#release-660]
== Release 6.6.0 (August 2020)

Couchbase Server 6.6 was released in August 2020.

_Quick Links_: <<supported-platforms-660>> | <<deprecation-660>> | <<known-issues-660>> | <<fixed-issues-660>>

[#changes-in-behavior-660]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

* Search queries from N1QL
+
Previously, for SEARCH queries from N1QL, you could use any analyzer for queries that do not use an analyzer (Term, Phrase, Multiphrase, Fuzzy, Prefix, Regexp, WildCard queries). However, this caused inconsistent results between covered and non-covered queries. To ensure consistent results with covering and non-covering index queries, a keyword analyzer for queries that don't use an analyzer is mandated.

[#supported-platforms-660]
=== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the following platforms:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.2

See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

[#deprecation-660]
=== Deprecated Features and Platforms

==== Deprecated and Removed Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 is deprecated.
* Debian 8 is no longer supported.
* Java Runtime Environment(JRE) Version 8 is no longer supported.  The Analytics Service requires JRE Version 11 or later to be installed.

==== Deprecated and Removed Features

* The cbbackup, cbrestore, and cbbackupwrapper utilities are deprecated in this release.

[#known-issues-660]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40727[MB-40727^]
| *Summary:* When creating a secondary index with composite fields, and one or more of these fields have a numeric type (int, double), the Analytics service may run into repeated ingestion failure when a document is updated such that the indexed numeric field value changes between a real value and NULL or MISSING.

*Workaround*:  To avoid running into this issue, make sure the indexed numeric fields always have values (i.e. not NULL or MISSING), or drop any composite fields indexes that have numeric fields.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40693[MB-40693^]
| *Summary:* The Analytics service throws an error when creating a link from an IPv4 configured cluster to an IPv6 configured cluster.

*Workaround*: Set the jvmArgs on the Analytics Service to "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false" and restart the Analytics cluster. 
For example, `curl -u Administrator:password -X PUT 'http://localhost:8095/analytics/config/service' --data-urlencode 'jvmArgs=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false'`.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40576[MB-40576^]
| *Summary:* If an identifier for a metadata entity (e.g. a dataverse or a dataset) contains characters that require URL encoding (percent-encoding) when used in a URI, requests that use this identifier can fail with an URISyntaxException.

*Workaround*: Construct identifiers using characters that do not require URL encoding.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40400[MB-40400^]
| *Summary:* When using alternate addresses for remote links, at least one node in the remote cluster must have the management[SSL] port exposed, and ALL data(KV) nodes have the kv[SSL] port exposed. Failure to do so will result in a 400 (Bad Request) when creating or altering a link. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39883[MB-39883^]
| *Summary:* Currently, the roles, `cluster_admin` and `bucket_admin`, are incorrectly allowed to read analytics data as the analytics permissions aren't explicitly excluded from the roles. The current xref:analytics:rest-analytics.adoc[Analytics REST API documentation] also mention that a `cluster_admin` can access several APIs and perform Analytics operations. 

However,these roles should not be able to read any data and this behavior is planned to be fixed in an upcoming release. Note that once the fix is implemented, the `cluster_admin` role will not be able to perform any Analytics operations, which may cause a backward compatibility issue.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36461[MB-36461^]
| *Summary:* In cases where the input to IN subclause with EVERY quantifier is MISSING or NULL, Analytics and Query engines differ in behavior. The Analytics service treats MISSING or NULL input values(in this case) as equivalent to an empty array, which results in the whole `EVERY … IN …` expression returning TRUE, while the Query service returns MISSING if the input is MISSING (or NULL if the input is NULL).

*Workaround*: Use the IS KNOWN predicate to test whether the IN value is not NULL/MISSING.
`WHERE (x IS KNOWN) AND (EVERY y IN x SATISFIES ... END)`
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39887[MB-39887^]
a| *Summary*: Using negate(NEG) match and match_phrase queries WITHOUT the “analyzer” setting can lead to no results being returned. This issue can happen for non-covered queries only when either of the following are NOT specified: 

* Index name in the options.
* Analyzer to use for the match query.

This is because, in such a non-covering query, the context of what index to use is missing in the verification phase and the default "standard" analyzer is used instead of the "keyword" analyzer which was used in the index. 

*Workaround*: Specify the analyzer to use with the non-covering queries, or the index name within the options explicitly.
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39990[MB-39990^]
| *Summary*: While adding support for explicit connections to IPv4, IPv6, or both for external communications for both HTTP and TLSUnique listeners, a considerable degradation in throughput was observed on Windows platform when using IPv6. This is caused by an https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40243[underlying issue in Golang].

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v660-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40767[MB-40767^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where recursion detection caused an Out-of-Memory exception when `allowInterBucketRecursion` was set to true.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40009[MB-40009^]
| *Summary*: Following a KillAndRespawn restart, the "from-now" directive was ignored and started from 0 instead of the expected start from current sequence number. This has been fixed. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39878[MB-39878^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing service crashed due to a race condition between undeploy and delete. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39874[MB-39874^]
| *Summary*: To help distinguish slow performing queries from Eventing JavaScript code, Eventing service now adds a default clientContextId to every N1QL query fired from an Eventing function.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39713[MB-39713^]
| *Summary*: To avoid inter-function recursion through N1QL statements, Eventing service now performs recursion checks for static N1QL statements in Eventing functions.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39399[MB-39399^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the timer scan time kept increasing on an idle cluster with a timer handler.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39335[MB-39335^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the eventing consumer RSS did not honor Eventing memory quota for bucket operations with small documents.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39080[MB-39080^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where cbevent failed to run with localhost.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38793[MB-38793^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing log files permissions were excessively restrictive (0600), which prevented them from being processed by third-party tools. The log files permissions have been updated (0640). 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38731[MB-38731^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing status is now displayed right alongside the handlers in the web console(UI).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38729[MB-38729^]
| *Summary*: Added the ability to cancel timers.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38554[MB-38554^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where a timer created during a timer execution was not triggered.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38533[MB-38533^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where timers were not cancelled if multiple timers were created with the same reference.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38321[MB-38321^]
| *Summary*: When slow eventing functions were deployed first with feed boundary set to "everything", subsequent functions on the same source bucket were starved due to DCP backing up. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28734[MB-28734^]
| *Summary*: Eventing timers can now be cancelled using cancelTimer() function, or by creating a new timer with same reference as an existing timer. In addition, a function that is invoked by a timer callback can create fresh timers.

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v660-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39605[MB-39605^]
| *Summary*: To help troubleshoot memory usage issues with the storage engine, lastGCSn and currSn will now be exposed as MOI storage stats.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39512[MB-39512^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a runtime error caused by invalid memory address or nil pointer derefernce by adding compression correctness checks. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39452[MB-39452^]
| *Summary*: The index service now sets a more contextual user-agent in HTTP requests to the cluster manager(ns_server).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39420[MB-39420^]
| *Summary*: Fixed the index service to re-generate protobuf files (.pb.go) files when .proto files are updated.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39114[MB-39114^]
| *Summary*: During index definition operations, the cluster info cache is updated multiple times. In a cluster with large number of buckets, refreshing the cluster info cache took a long time and slowed down these operations. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38988[MB-38988^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a rare race condition that caused the index service to be stuck in the warmup state. This has been fixed by increasing the default size of the feed's backch.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38864[MB-38864^]
| *Summary*: During bulk inserts of heavy workloads, index sync was observed to take a long time. This has been addressed by optimizing indexing of incremental workloads for insert heavy scenarios.

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_v660-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38929[MB-38929^]
| *Summary*: The Index Advisor now supports virtual keyspace for DELETE, MERGE, and UPDATE statements.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31105[MB-31105^]
| *Summary*: The Query service now supports explicit connections to IPv4 or IPv6 or both for extexternal communications for both HTTP and TLSUnique listeners. And the Query service will fail to start if it cannot listen on all required ports.

Note that when using IPv6 on Windows platform, this can cause a considerable degradation in throughput due to an https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40243[underlying issue in Golang].

| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the document mapping's analyzer was not inherited by child fields. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39592[MB-39592^]
| *Summary*: To ensure consistent results with covering and non-covering flex index queries, we mandate a keyword analyzer for queries that don't use an analyzer. For non-covering flex index queries, we recommend that you specify the index name, or use a match query and explicitly specify the analyzer to be used.
