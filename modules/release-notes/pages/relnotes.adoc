== Release 4.5.1

Couchbase Server 4.5.1, released in October 2016, is the first maintenance release in the 4.5.x series for Couchbase Server.

*Behavior Changes*

This section lists the behavior changes in the product compared to the previous release.

Path expression in the FROM clause is no longer supported.
Any queries that use the path expression in the FROM clause will fail.
For example, the following query will fail:

----
SELECT <field2> FROM <bucket1>.<field1>;
----

You must rewrite the queries using the path expression in the projection instead.
For example, rewrite the query above as follows:

----
SELECT <field1>.<field2> FROM <bucket1>;
----

*Known Issues*

This list covers some of the known problems with Couchbase Server 4.5.1.
Please read this before reporting any new bugs, and watch for updates as new bugs are discovered.

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-20403[MB-20403]
 The bucket being backed up is xref:clustersetup:bucket-flush.adoc#topic_v1t_trm_gv[flushed] between incremental backups
 The bucket being backed up is deleted and re-created in between incremental backups
 The bucket has not been backed up between a document's deletion and the xref:architecture:core-data-access-bucket-disk-storage.adoc#tombstone[metadata for that deleted document being purged]
 There has been a failover between incremental backups of the bucket
| The `cbbackupmgr merge` command will not function correctly and may cause data corruption under the following circumstances:



For more information about the Merge functionality, see xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-merge.adoc#cbbackupmgr-merge.1[cbbackupmgr merge].

*Workaround*: In the interim, the recommendation is to perform a full backup if you experience any of the above scenarios.
This will lead to longer backup times than performing incremental backups, but will avoid potential data corruption due to to the aforementioned issue.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-21597[MB-21597]
| In the case of concurrent sub-document API operations from multiple clients, Couchbase Server does not honor the atomicity.
This can result in one update overwriting the previous update, even though the previous update was successful as far as the client is concerned.

*Workaround:* For use cases where sub-document API is being used and are covered by an Enterprise Edition license, contact Couchbase Support.
For all other cases, Couchbase recommends that you do not use the sub-document API feature for concurrent updates.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-21038[MB-21038]
| During rolling upgrade from Couchbase 4.0 to 4.5, if the query node is upgraded to 4.5 and the index node is on 4.0, `stale=false` query can crash the indexer.

*Workaround: *Upgrade the index node to 4.5 first before query nodes.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20509[MB-20509]
| Couchbase Server 4.5.x is not supported on the macOS Sierra (OS X 10.12) platform.

*Workaround: *We are working on a fix and recommend that you do not upgrade the OS X version to macOS Sierra until the patch with the fix is available.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-20338[MB-20338]
| During the source cluster rebalancing, in some cases when a node is removed, the outbound XDCR mutation statistics show a negative number.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20337[MB-20337]
| XDCR does not send all the mutations when the target cluster is rebalancing.

*Workaround: *Wait for a few minutes (3-4mins) after the rebalance operation completes for XDCR to pick up from the last checkpoint..

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19846[MB-19846]
| A rebalance failure due to DCP disconnection can occur on an idle DCP connection if no-op messages cannot be exchanged due to network congestion and/or heavy CPU usage.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19806[MB-19806]
| Online upgrade from versions 2.x or 3.x to 4.5.x may fail.

*Workaround: *Upgrade to version 4.0/4.1 first, and then upgrade to the latest 4.5.x version.
For more information, see xref:install:upgrade-matrix.adoc#topic_dwm_qfv_xs[Upgrade Matrix].

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17433[MB-17433]
| An error is thrown when trying to create more than 10 full-text indexes.

*Workaround: *Reduce the setting `maxPartitionsPerPIndex` to a number lower than 32 (default), such as 16.

*N1QL Enhancements*

[#table_dd3_ff4_lx,cols="25,77"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20067[MB-20067]
| Added a new N1QL string function `SUFFIXES()` which produces all suffix substrings of a given string or parameter.
This function helps process LIKE ‘%substring%’ queries efficiently.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19953[MB-19953]
| Performance improvement for DISTINCT operator processing.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19857[MB-19857]
| The UPDATE statement is enhanced to evaluate functions and expressions in the FOR-clause.
Its syntax is enhanced to support multiple nested FOR clauses to access and update fields in nested arrays.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19809[MB-19809]
| When constructing objects in a N1QL query, the names of fields in name-value pairs can be dynamically generated.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19777[MB-19777]
| When constructing objects in a N1QL query, the names of fields in name-value pairs is made optional.
For example, the following query is valid in 4.5.1 and implicitly assigns names "type" and "name" for respective values:

SELECT {type, name} FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 2;

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19733[MB-19733]
| Prior to 4.5.1, many expressions and predicates that can use an index did not do so.
This optimization fixes this issue.
For example, the type of queries that can benefit from this are :

CREATE INDEX idx_b ON default(b); EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM default WHERE 1 IN b; CREATE INDEX idx_and ON default(a = 5 AND b = 6); EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM default WHERE a = 5 AND b = 6;

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19680[MB-19680]
| Added a new N1QL array function `ARRAY_INTERSECT()` which takes two or more arrays as parameters and returns the intersection of the input arrays as the result.
It returns an empty array if there are no common array elements.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19575[MB-19575]
| Performance optimization for COUNT() queries with LIKE "prefix%".
When applicable, N1QL uses the IndexCountScan operator and pushes down the count to indexer.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19574[MB-19574]
| This enhancement enables queries with LIKE predicates to use an index that is defined with a covering predicate.
For example, if index is created with LIKE ‘string1%’ , then queries with LIKE ‘string1string2%’ will use the index.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19150[MB-19150]
| A new query parameter pretty is added to enable/disable pretty formatting of query result.
When set to false, the white space characters are stripped from the query results, which reduces the number of bytes transferred over the network.
The performance benefits are significantly visible with large result sets.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18482[MB-18482]
| Performance optimization to push down LIMIT to the indexes, resulting in fewer rows emitted from indexes, faster query filtering, and quicker stop.

[#release-450]
== Release 4.5.0

Couchbase Server 4.5 was released in June 2016.

The version 4.5 of Couchbase Server includes new features and behavior changes.
The following sections list the behavior changes, fixed issues, known issues, and deprecated items.

*Behavior Changes*

Here are the behavior changes in the product, compared to the previous release:

* Disabling scientific notation for integers.
With this change, large integers are no longer displayed in the scientific notation in N1QL.
For example, large numbers will no longer be reported in the scientific format: `"Column1": 9.223372036854776e+18`.
Instead, Couchbase Server will return `"Column1": 9223372036854775807`.
Details for the change can be found in https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-14720[MB-14720].
* `PENDING` index state is now represented as `DEFERRED` and `BUILDING`.
With this change, global secondary indexes no longer display a `PENDING` state under the status in `SYSTEM:INDEXES`.
Instead, global secondary indexes that are actively being built display `BUILDING` and global secondary indexes that are created with the `DEFER_BUILD` option display `DEFERRED` for the status attribute in the `SYSTEM:INDEXES` output in N1QL.
Details for the change can be found in https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-14679[MB-14679].
* When the GROUP BY clause is present in a N1QL query, it is not valid to have any fields in SELECT <[.var]`projection_list`> expressions that are either not referred in GROUP BY expressions, or not in the aggregate functions in the <[.var]`projection_list`>.
Further, the GROUP BY clause is required (on the non-aggregated field) if the <[.var]`projection_list`> has some fields aggregated and some not.
This correct GROUP BY behavior is enforced, because each result row might otherwise have more than one possible value for the ungrouped columns/fields.
If a query doesn't follow this rule, error code 4210 with message "Expression must be a group key or aggregate: \....
" is thrown.
* The new backup tool is called `cbbackupmgr`, and it is not backward compatible with older backup files from previous releases.
If you want to take a backup of a previous release and then load and restore it in Couchbase Server 4.5, you should use the old `cbbackup` tool (not the new `cbbackupmgr`).
After you restore the data into version 4.5, you can start using the `cbbackupmgr` for subsequent backup/restore operations to other Couchbase Server 4.5 nodes.
* With the new [.cmd]`cbbackupmgr` tool, if you're trying to restore a SASL protected bucket, then you need to first create a bucket with a SASL password on the target cluster before you run the restore operation.
* New network ports:

| *Issue*
| *Description*

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-20403[MB-20403]
 The bucket being backed up is xref:clustersetup:bucket-flush.adoc#topic_v1t_trm_gv[flushed] between incremental backups
 The bucket being backed up is deleted and re-created in between incremental backups
 The bucket has not been backed up between a document's deletion and the xref:architecture:core-data-access-bucket-disk-storage.adoc#tombstone[metadata for that deleted document being purged]
 There has been a failover between incremental backups of the bucket
| The `cbbackupmgr merge` command will not function correctly and may cause data corruption under the following circumstances:



For more information about the Merge functionality, see xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-merge.adoc#cbbackupmgr-merge.1[cbbackupmgr merge].

*Workaround*: In the interim, the recommendation is to perform a full backup if you experience any of the above scenarios.
This will lead to longer backup times than performing incremental backups, but will avoid potential data corruption due to to the aforementioned issue.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-21597[MB-21597]
| In the case of concurrent sub-document API operations from multiple clients, Couchbase Server does not honor the atomicity.
This can result in one update overwriting the previous update, even though the previous update was successful as far as the client is concerned.

*Workaround:* For use cases where sub-document API is being used and are covered by an Enterprise Edition license, contact Couchbase Support.
For all other cases, Couchbase recommends that you do not use the sub-document API feature for concurrent updates.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20519[MB-20519]
| Couchbase Server 4.5 is not supported on Windows 10 Anniversary Update.

_Updated October 18, 2016_: Windows 10 Anniversary Edition Developer Preview for Couchbase Server 4.5.1 is now available.
Get the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition Developer Preview build from the http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/downloads[Downloads] page.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20509[MB-20509]
| Couchbase Server 4.5 is not supported on the macOS Sierra (OS X 10.12) platform.

We are working on a fix and recommend that you do not upgrade the OS X version to macOS Sierra until the patch with the fix is available.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19706[MB-19920]
| When backup fails and you restart the backup with the `--resume` flag, it may cause items to be skipped.
Consequently, if you then restore this backup, the items in the bucket may not be the same as the original.

*Workaround: *When restarting backup, use the `--purge` flag to remove the partial backup and restart from the point of the previous successful backup.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19892[MB-19892]
| After a hard failover, you may not be able to re-add a node with data service because the old vBucket files were not deleted.

*Workaround:* Restart Couchbase Server on the removed node before adding it back to the cluster.

| Different query results are returned depending on whether the index is present or not.

*Workaround : *This happens when the UNION/INTERSECT is within the subquery of the FROM clause when one branch is a covering scan and other is not.
The workaround is to create covered indexes for both the branches.

| A rebalance failure due to DCP disconnection can occur on an idle DCP connection if no-op messages cannot be exchanged due to network congestion and/or heavy CPU usage.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19764[MB-19764]
| Malformed or unknown roles seen when using the CLI.

*Workaround:* Retry your command in the CLI using the following role strings - admin, ro_admin, cluster_admin, replication_admin, bucket_admin[<[.var]`bucket name`> or '*'], views_admin[<[.var]`bucket name`> or '*']

* Use client side sorting.
* Don't use RAW and work with the default JSON output which is sorted with ORDER BY.
| When using RAW in N1QL query with the ORDER BY clause, the output result set is not sorted.

| Online upgrade from 2.x or 3.x versions to 4.5 may fail.

*Workaround:* Upgrade to version 4.0/4.1 first, and then upgrade to the latest 4.5.
For more information, see the supported xref:install:upgrade-matrix.adoc[Upgrade Matrix].

| The Server Web Console UI and REST API over HTTPS doesn't work for center web clients like https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5682529109540864[Chrome 50] or higher that send elliptic curve X25519 requests for TLS.

*Workaround:* Use other browsers that do not use X25519 such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, or Chrome (version 49 or below).

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19582[MB-19582]
| Backing up a cluster when rebalance is in progress causes an error.

*Workaround:* Wait for the rebalance to complete before taking a backup.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19432[MB-19432]
| Rebalancing during indexing with 5 or more indexes and replicas is observed to be slow.

*Workaround:* Allow sufficient time for rebalance to complete.
You may want to consider deleting indexes before rebalancing if that is an option.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19319[MB-19319]
| On SuSE 11, log collection from the UI hangs.

*Workaround:* Run [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` from the command line instead.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19271[MB-19271]
| Idle nodes with the search service were observed to suddenly consume 100% CPU.

*Workaround:* This behavior typically occurs every 8 hours and the CPU usage typically returns to normal levels in a few minutes.
Consider adjusting the ForestDB compaction settings to trigger more frequent compactions or run compactions when the cluster is idle.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17433[MB-17433]
| An error is thrown when trying to create more than 10 full text indexes.

*Workaround:* Try reducing the setting [.param]`maxPartitionsPerPIndex` to a number lower than 32 (default), such as 16.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16618[MB-16618]
| View queries with the options reduce and group set to true when parameterized by a list of keys that are not in ascending order can produce results that are not properly reduced.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16385[MB-16385]
| Querying a view with a reduce function based on a subset of partitions resulted in a massive memory usage.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16085[MB-16085]
| When view building was in progress, and the view is dropped, indexing still continued to happen consuming CPU resources.
