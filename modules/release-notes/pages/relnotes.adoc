= Release Notes for Couchbase Server 6.0

Couchbase Server 6.0 is an important release that adds the Analytics service to the Couchbase Data Platform.
It also includes enhancements to the Eventing and Search services.

Take a look at xref:introduction:whats-new.adoc[What's New?] for a list of new features and improvements that are available in this release.

[#release-600]
== Release 6.0

Couchbase Server 6.0 was released in October 2018.

[#changes-in-behavior-600]
=== Major Behavior Changes

There are a few significant changes to the production-ready version of the Analytics service.
You'll find this information handy if you've used the Analytics service in any of the Developer Preview versions of Couchbase Server.

* Bucket association is now automatic
+
The Developer Preview versions required you to explicitly associate the Couchbase Server buckets and Analytics buckets.
For example:
+
----
CREATE BUCKET ha WITH {"name":"health"}
----
+
The Analytics service buckets now automatically mirror Couchbase Server buckets. For instance, after using the previous example command, other Analytics DDL commands would be able to refer to the bucket `health` without any extra configuration.

* Dataset definitions no longer require the SHADOW keyword
+
The early Developer Preview releases (earlier than Couchbase Server 5.5) required the SHADOW keyword.
+
The Analytics service (Developer Preview version) was integrated with Couchbase Server during release 5.5 and the SHADOW keyword was made optional.
+
Starting with this release, using the SHADOW keyword is no longer allowed, and using it will return an error.
+
----
CREATE DATASET ((dataverse_name.)? dataset_name)? ON bucket_name (WHERE where_exp)?.
----

* `CONNECT/DISCONNECT BUCKET` have been replaced by `CONNECT/DISCONNECT LINK`
+
The `CONNECT` and `DISCONNECT` commands would activate or deactivate the dataset processing of data from Couchbase Server buckets.
+
You can now use the following syntax to connect all datasets in a dataverse:
+
----
CONNECT LINK (dataverse_name.)? Local (, (dataverse_name.)? Local)*
----

[#table_knownissues_v600-cluster,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23074[MB-23074^]
| *Summary*: Performance issues may be observed when running Couchbase Server on CentOS 7.3 with kernel 3.10.0-514.6.
|===

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30007[MB-30007^]
| *Summary*: It is possible for a CONNECT BUCKET statement to fail temporarily with the error message "The vbucket belongs to another server(0x7)" when rebalancing Data nodes.

*Workaround*: Retry the operation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28544[MB-28544^]
| *Summary*: The UNION ALL operation does not work for all query types. For example, a query of the form shown below is not parsed correctly.

----
(SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
                  UNION ALL
                  (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
----

*Workaround*: Remove the parentheses around the first subquery block.

----
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
                      UNION ALL
                      (SELECT ...
                      FROM ...
                      WHERE ...)
----

==== Data Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: Following a Memcached crash, the data node is observed to be stuck in a pending state.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809^]
| *Summary*: The `last_modified` attribute can be incorrect if a bucket was upgraded and contains old documents.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30772[MB-30772^]
| *Summary*: Killing an Eventing process externally may result in a loss of timers that have been dequeued but not run to completion.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29360[MB-29360^]
| *Summary*: When Sync Gateway is deployed against a bucket, a single document update can be seen over DCP as multiple mutations, some modifying body and others modifying XATTRs. The Eventing service invokes OnUpdate for each such mutation as it does not distinguish at the DCP level if an update modified the body of a document, the XATTRs, or both.

*Workaround*: When both Eventing service and Sync Gateway are deployed against the same bucket, you must ensure that the Eventing code written is idempotent.

==== Full-Text Search Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-fts,cols="25,66"]

| Issue | Description

| *Summary*: A disk usage spike is observed during the initial index build. The disk usage comes down once the log cleaner catches up.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30011[MB-30011^]
| *Summary*: The rebalance progress (in percentage) during a GSI swap rebalance does not always increase linearly. Note that this issue does not persist and the percentage displayed returns to normal quickly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-19869[MB-19869^]
| *Summary*: Rebalance fails when taking out failed over nodes running views, in certain circumstances.
