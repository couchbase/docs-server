[#release-552]
== Release 5.5.2

Couchbase Server 5.5.2, released in October 2018, is the second maintenance release in the 5.5.x series for Couchbase Server.
This maintenance release includes fixes to the index and query services, XDCR, and installer components.

[#fixed-issues-552]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_xdcr_552,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31141[MB-31141^]
| Fixed an issue where replication from version 4.5.x to version 5.5.x caused corruption on deleted documents leading to inability to rebalance.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_fixedissues_index_552,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30509[MB-30509^]
| In previous releases, the memory consumption of the index service could exceed the index service’s RAM quota setting. This caused problems when the quota was set to an amount that was close to the physical RAM on the Server node, for example this could lead to an out of memory error. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30412[MB-30412^]
| After a rebalance, the index service was stuck waiting for Memcached. This has been fixed by adding a timeout mechanism so the index service does not hang.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30382[MB-30382^]
| Fixed an issue where the index service threw an error if an index was dropped when index mutation was ongoing.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29982[MB-29982^]
| The authentication requests from projector to Memcached now have a fixed timeout to avoid infinite wait time.
|===

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_fixedissues_install_552,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30227[MB-30227^]
| Fixed an issue where in-place (offline) upgrades to Couchbase Server on Windows from 5.0.x or 5.1.x to later releases failed.
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_query_552,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31269[MB-31269^]
| A race condition was observed when deleting a system bucket if the bucket was in use by a system bucket scan.
This is a rare condition where the wrong unlock was used when the scan resumed after the delete operation completed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31240[MB-31240^]
| When establishing connections, the cbq-engine would hang if the data node did not respond when trying to establish a handshake packet exchange with the data node.
This has been fixed and the cbq-engine now throws an error if the connection cannot be established.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31017[MB-31017^]
| An empty array in the index scan caused incorrect results. This was observed when the scan_cap parameter was set to a small number (say 2) and thus, backfill was used.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30946[MB-30946^]
| Fixed an issue where an empty array from index scan did not work as expected when backfill was used.
|===

[#release-551]
== Release 5.5.1

Couchbase Server 5.5.1, released in August 2018, is the first maintenance release in the 5.5.x series for Couchbase Server.

[#fixed-issues-551]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_data_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30868[MB-30868^]
| Fixed an issue where the logs collected from the UI did not use the same salt across all nodes even though they were collected at the same time.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30610[MB-30610^]
| Fixed an issue where the Memcached process was unable to start if IPv6 protocol stack was disabled.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_fixedissues_index_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30870[MB-30870^]
| During warmup, one of the indexes with low number of items triggered an issue and caused the internal garbage collector to run forever.
Thus causing the entire index service to stall during warmup.
This issue was observed when using Plasma storage engine.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30823[MB-30823^]
| Fixed an issue where the index service crashed with a "slice bounds out of range"  error.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-2xxxx[MB-30672^]
| Fixed an issue where upgrading from 4.x to 5.x version of Couchbase Server caused an outage for GSI standard indexes.
This was observed during rolling upgrade from ForestDB to Plasma.
When the last ForestDB index service node was taken out of the cluster, the cluster compatibility mode changed to Plasma and the index service restarted.
|===

==== Installation

[#table_fixedissues_install_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30413[MB-30413^]
| Uninstalling Couchbase Server on a Debian-based systemd distribution such as Ubuntu 16 using "apt-get remove" and then running "systemctl status couchbase-server" reported that the service still exists but is "masked".
This means the service was explicitly disabled in such a way that it could not be started, automatically or by hand.
As a result, subsequent installations of any version of Couchbase Server failed as the service was rendered unstartable.
|===

==== Tools, Web Console (UI) and REST API

[#table_fixedissues_tools-ui_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30636[MB-30636^]
| Fixed an issue where an unexpected token error was seen when accessing the Web Console in Couchbase Server version 5.5.0.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30589[MB-30589^]
| Fixed an issue where the warning message on the Web Console showed an incorrect flag for the removal of dedicated bucket port as `--remove-port` instead of `--remove-bucket-port`.
|===

[#release-550]
== Release 5.5.0

Couchbase Server 5.5.0 was released in July 2018.

[#changes-in-behavior]
=== Major Behavior Changes

[#table_change-behavior,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28778[MB-28778^]
| The default number of Data Service worker threads has been increased; from 3/4 of the number of available CPU threads, to 7/8 of the number of available CPU threads (minimum of 4 in both cases).
This makes better use of the available CPU resource, particularly on larger systems, as such users may see an increase in CPU utilization on such systems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28417[MB-28417^]
| The permissions assigned to the cluster_admin role have been downgraded.
As a result, The cluster_admin role no longer has FTS write permissions used to create FTS searches.

_Workaround_: Add the *fts_admin* role as required.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27173[MB-27173^]
| Prior to 5.5, the [.cmd]`mctimings` command defined the _request start_ as the time when the 24 byte request header had been read by the Data Service.
However, many requests contain a _body_ which also needs to be read before a request can be processed.
As such, the reported duration didn't accurately reflect how long the server actually spent processing a request, if it was still waiting for the body to be received from the network.

In 5.5, the definition of _request start_ has been changed to be when the header _and_ body have both been read.
This has the effect of more accurately reflecting the time spent by the Data Service in servicing a request, as the time the body spends in transit over the network is no longer included.
As a result command timings for affected request will have shorter durations compared to how they were measured before 5.5.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27060[MB-27060^]
| The Couchbase Server 5.5 Windows installer package no longer bundles the DLL [.path]_dbghelp.dll_ which is required by Breakpad to produce dumps on Windows platforms.
Starting version 5.5, Breakpad will pick the DLL (dbghelp.dll) that is shipped with the OS.
|===

[#supported-platforms-550]
=== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the Debian 9 platform.
See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

| *Summary*: Performance issues may be observed when running Couchbase Server on CentOS 7.3 with kernel 3.10.0-514.6.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-17571[MB-17571^]
| *Summary:* On an undersized node, the default memory quota assigned to all the selected services by the server might result in a failure.

*Workaround:* Adjust the memory allocations appropriately to work around this issue.

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30610[MB-30610^]
a|
*Summary*: Memcached process unable to start if IPv6 protocol stack has been disabled.
*Workaround*: There are two generally accepted methods to disable IPv6 on recent Linux distributions:

. Disable the entire IPv6 protocol stack - typically by adding a boot-time grub parameter: `ipv6.disable=1`.
. Disable assignment of IPv6 addresses to interfaces - either by setting the boot-time grub parameter: `ipv6.disable_ipv6=1`, or dynamically by setting the appropriate `net.ipv6.conf` sysctl properties.

Only the first method to disable IPv6 will cause Memcached to not start correctly.
As a workaround you can disable IPv6 using the second method instead.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: The data node is in a pending state after memcached crashes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809^]

It was possible for a rebalance of the Analytics nodes to always fail if:

* a bucket was in the disconnected state, and
* the Analytics nodes were at different DCP states.

In that case a common DCP state (required for rebalancing) could not be achieved as no new DCP mutations were received by the Analytics nodes.
