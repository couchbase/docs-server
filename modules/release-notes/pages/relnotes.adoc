== Major Behavior Changes

[#table_change-behavior,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28778[MB-28778]
| The default number of Data Service worker threads has been increased; from 3/4 of the number of available CPU threads, to 7/8 of the number of available CPU threads (minimum of 4 in both cases).
This makes better use of the available CPU resource, particularly on larger systems, as such users may see an increase in CPU utilization on such systems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28417[MB-28417]
| The permissions assigned to the cluster_admin role have been downgraded.
As a result, The cluster_admin role no longer has FTS write permissions used to create FTS searches.

_Workaround_: Add the *fts_admin* role as required.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27173[MB-27173]
| Prior to 5.5, the [.cmd]`mctimings` command defined the _request start_ as the time when the 24 byte request header had been read by the Data Service.
However, many requests contain a _body_ which also needs to be read before a request can be processed.
As such, the reported duration didn't accurately reflect how long the server actually spent processing a request, if it was still waiting for the body to be received from the network.

In 5.5, the definition of _request start_ has been changed to be when the header _and_ body have both been read.
This has the effect of more accurately reflecting the time spent by the Data Service in servicing a request, as the time the body spends in transit over the network is no longer included.
As a result command timings for affected request will have shorter durations compared to how they were measured before 5.5.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27060[MB-27060]
| The Couchbase Server 5.5 Windows installer package no longer bundles the DLL [.path]_dbghelp.dll_ which is required by Breakpad to produce dumps on Windows platforms.
Starting version 5.5, Breakpad will pick the DLL (dbghelp.dll) that is shipped with the OS.
|===

== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the Debian 9 platform.
See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc#topic1634[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

== Deprecated Features and Platforms

The following functionality is deprecated, will be deprecated or is unsupported.

* Server side Moxi or buckets with custom server side Moxi ports are deprecated and may be removed from the product in the future.
* The ability to create a bucket with a Moxi port has been deprecated.
The CLI commands have been updated to remove Moxi ports for bucket create and bucket edit operations.

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074]
| *Summary*: The data node is in a pending state after memcached crashes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809]

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29841[MB-29841]
| *Summary*: The debugger is unable to apply the source map generated by the transpiler.
A recent update in the Chrome browser version 66.0.3359.181 is causing this issue.
Since Google doesn't allow previous versions of Chrome to be downloaded, you can download previous versions of Chromium.
The debugger works fine with source maps on Chromium version 63.0.3239.0.

Note: Our fix for Chromium is tagged to *69.0.3466.0~157*.
As per the https://www.chromium.org/developers/calendar[Chrome release calendar], 69.x is set to release on September 4th 2018.
The fix has been merged to Chrome Canary and is available at https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29360[MB-29360]

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29271[MB-29271]
| *Summary*: When a rebalance is in progress the Eventing service hangs when memcached is killed on data and eventing nodes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28555[MB-28555]
| *Summary*: The Eventing service currently does not provide the ability to specify a port range.
Instead, the OS arbitrarily allocates a port for the Chrome Debugger.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28414[MB-28414]
| *Summary*: The eventing service misses some mutations with non-default vBuckets (535,1001 etc).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28120[MB-28120]
| *Summary*: The eventing service rebalance progress jumps from 24% to Finish.

| *Summary*: When there are multiple functions being deployed, undeployment does not happen until all functions are deployed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27559[MB-27559]
| *Summary*: Benign panics can be seen in the eventing service logs during undeployment.

It was possible for a rebalance of the Analytics nodes to always fail if:

[#ul_p4d_cwn_bdb]
* a bucket was in the disconnected state, and
* the Analytics nodes were at different DCP states.

In that case a common DCP state (required for rebalancing) could not be achieved as no new DCP mutations were received by the Analytics nodes.
