:page-aliases: analytics:releasenote
:description: Couchbase Server 7.1 introduces multiple new features.

:supported-platforms-url: See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms, and notes on deprecated platforms.

[#release-715]
== Release 7.1.5 (August 2023)

Couchbase Server 7.1.5 was released in August 2023.
This release contains a new XDCR feature and fixes to issues.

=== New XDCR Feature

XDCR replications, specified by means of the REST API, can now use the `filterBinary` flag.
This specifies whether binary documents should be replicated.

Detailed information on the xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc#filter-binary[filterBinary flag] is provided on the REST reference page xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[Creating a Replication].

=== Fixed Issues

This release contains the fixes listed below.

==== Cluster Manager

[#table-fixed-issues-715-clustermanager,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57484[MB-57484^]
|An ns_server process crash meant the Delete Bucket memcached command was not always called before bucket files were deleted later in rebalance. This caused the memcached process to crash repeatedly causing data service downtime.
|The Delete Bucket command is now called on memcached before a file is deleted during rebalance. This ensures mencached doesnâ€™t attempt to read the files.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57614[MB-57614^]
|When the REST API attempted to access unsupported stats, such as meta_latency_wt,  "stats_reader" crashed on the ns_server side.
|ns_server now returns a "not_found" status when the REST API is called with unsupported stats.

|===

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table-fixed-issues-715-xdcr,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56712[MB-56712^]
|XDCR did not process documents with a JSON array and Extended Attributes (XATTRs). When a document contained XATTRs, XDCR checked for XATTRs in transactions, transaction filters were enabled, and XATTRs were not checked.
|When documents contain arrays, XATTRs are now checked in the transaction XATTRs, and the document is not prevented from being parsed in an array.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56798[MB-56798^]
|Data streamed from the Data Service over XDCR should always be streamed in order by mutation id. However, in some scenarios, for efficiency, the Data Service streamed records that were not ordered by mutation id. In certain situations, this out-of-sequence-order [OSO] caused performance issues.
|OSO mode is now available as a global override to be switched off for any currently deployed replications to avoid performance issues.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56800[MB-56800^]
|Checkpoint Manager created checkpoint records out-of-sequence when many target nodes ran slowly.
|Checkpoint Manager now creates checkpoints in sequence when target nodes are slow.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56847[MB-56847^]
|There was an issue in the ns_server stats collector when the Resource Manager checked the pipeline status to obtain the replication priority to provide more resources for higher priority pipelines.
|Resource Manager does not now check replication pipeline statuses when all replication pipelines have either the exact same high or low priority.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56849[MB-56849^]
|XDCR on a non-KV node froze in the UI when the replication setting was changed multiple times. This caused the replication reload channel to be full.
|The replication reload channel does not now get full when changes are made multiple times to Non-KV nodes.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56850[MB-56850^]
|When target data nodes were undersized or consistently overwhelmed, XDCR memory usages could increase as it retried.
|Reallocated memory is now reused instead of generate garbage for GC to clean up.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57131[MB-57131^]
|A Checkpoint Manager Initialization error caused two memory leak types. These were a backfill pipeline and a main pipeline memory leak.
|The Pipeline Manager and backfill pipeline have both been modified to prevent the memory leaks.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57184[MB-57184^]
|XDCR Checkpoint Manager instances were not cleaned up under certain circumstances due to timing and networking issues when contacting target, or when an invalid backfill task was fed in as input.
|Checkpoint Manager instances are now cleaned up. A flag has been added to check for invalid backfill tasks.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57235[MB-57235^]
|When a replication spec change was made to a non-Data Service node, delete replication hung and caused the node to return an incorrect replication configuration.
|XDCR now checks that the node is running the Data Service and handles it correctly.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57413[MB-57413^]
|Running ipv6 only mode + non-encrypted remote resulted in invalid IP addresses being returned leading to connection issues.
|A valid IP address is now returned.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57463[MB-57463^]
|StatsMgr stopping could hang due to watching for notifications resulting in stranded go-routines.
|Go-routines are now stopped correctly.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57571[MB-57571^]
|When ipv4 only mode was used, and full encryption only had an alternate address configured where the internal address was unresolvable, XDCR resulted in an error when it contacted the target data nodes.
|The specific scenario has been fixed so that replication can now proceed.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57788[MB-57788^]
|A legacy race condition where metadata store could cause a conflict was exposed as part of the binary filter improvements.
|Legacy race conditions have all been resolved.

|===

==== Query Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-queryservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56533[MB-56533^]
|Due to how nested dependencies were handled, a sudden rise in memory utilization of the query service on a node caused a memory alert issue. The node did not recover correctly following a restart.
|Nested dependencies are now handled appropriately in the ADVISE statement.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56563[MB-56563^]
|A query with multiple filters on an index key, one of which was a parameter, could produce incorrect results. This was caused by incorrectly composing the exact index spans to support the query.
|The way in which exact spans are set has been modified to correct this issue.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56579[MB-56579^]
|Covering FLATTEN_KEYS() on an array index generated incorrect results. This was because a modified version of the ANY clause was applied after the index which meant false positives were retained and Distinct scan rows were eliminated.
|The ANY filter is now applied on an index scan itself when covering an index scan with flatten keys.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56683[MB-56683^]
|Inter-service read timeout errors were not detected or handled accordingly. User requests consequently failed with timeout errors without retrying with a new connection.
|The error handling and retry mechanism has been modified to handle these types of timeout issues and errors.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56727[MB-56727^]
|Under certain circumstances, a query with UNNEST used a covering index scan and incorrect results were returned. Reference to the UNNEST expression should have prevented the covering index from being used for the query as the index did not contain the entire array.
|The logic to determine covering UNNEST scans has been changed to not use a covering index scan for such queries.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56937[MB-56937^]
|When an index scan had multiple spans, index selectivity was incorrectly calculated.
|Index selectivity for multiple index spans is now correctly calculated.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56940[MB-56940^]
|Incorrect results were returned when a filter contained conditional query parameters. This issue was due to a problem in an OR clause that depended on a named parameter and not a document.
|Constant filters in the subterms of the OR clause are now detected and marked.
The extra check prevents index aggregation pushdown.
For classifying expressions, when there is an OR clause under an AND, processing removes any constant subterms.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56941[MB-56941^]
|A query plan was changed between Server releases. This meant the filter did not update the index when an OR clause pushed variable spans.
|The OR clause has been modified to correct this issue.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57024[MB-57024^]
|Incorrect results were returned for a non-IndexScan on a constant false condition. This was due to incorrect handling of a FALSE WHERE clause.
|The FALSE WHERE clause is now correctly handled.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57029[MB-57029^]
|Querying system:functions_cache in a multi query node cluster returned incomplete results with warnings. The query result included entries in the local query node, but none from remote query nodes. This was due to a typographical error.
|The typographical error has been corrected.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57080[MB-57080^]
|A panic in go_json.stateInString under parsed value functions caused by incorrect concurrent access resulted in the state being freed whilst still in use.
|The concurrent access issue has been resolved.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57216[MB-57216^]
|The values returned by the OBJECT_ functions were erroneously pooled and reused by subsequent invocations.  Depending on when values were reused, the original results were overwritten.
|Pooling has been removed eliminating the chance that values are overwritten.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57316[MB-57316^]
|cbq required a client authentication key file whenever a certificate authority file was used.
|cbq now accepts a certificate authority file without a client key file enabling use with username and password credentials.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57680[MB-57680^]
|When appropriate optimizer statistics were used in Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO), for a query with ORDER BY, if there were multiple indexes available for the query, CBO unconditionally favored an index that provided ordering. Such indexes were not always the best ones to use.
|CBO now allows cost-based comparison of indexes.

|===

==== Backup Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-backupservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57039[MB-57039^]
|Backup and Restore did not complete successfully when bucket names contained a period or full stop character [.] This was due to a filtering issue where this character was not correctly validated.
|Backup and Restore has been fixed to correctly handle any period characters in bucket names.

|===

==== Index Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-indexservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56195[MB-56195^]
|When indexer was under high memory pressure, queuing 256k mutations added to more memory pressure. For each bucket, indexer queued a minimum of 256k mutations before throttling for memory.
|The number of queued mutations has been reduced so that indexer can handle high memory pressure situations much better.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56340[MB-56340^]
|During scaling, an GSI indexer rebalance froze and did not successfully complete. This was because an index snapshot was not correctly deleted and recreated.
|A flag now handles snapshots to ensure they are correctly deleted or recreated when indexes are updated during rebalancing.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56341[MB-56341^]
|When the indexer was slow to process mutations, a rare race condition resulted in incorrect book-keeping for the indexer. This meant index builds did not complete.
|The race condition no longer happens.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56371[MB-56371^]
|When a partitioned key was based on a secondary field of a document and a delete mutation occurred, the Indexer could not determine which partition the document belonged to. This resulted in delete operations on all partitions.
|For partition indexes with document ID as the only partition key, delete mutations are routed only to the partition where the document belongs. This improves the performance of delete and expiration mutations.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56559[MB-56559^]
|The indexer.settings.rebalance.redistribute_indexes flag did not affect partitioned indexes. Partitioned Indexes were by default considered for movement during Rebalance.
|The indexer.settings.rebalance.redistribute_indexes flag has been modified to consider partitioned and non-partitioned indexes when restricting the number of index movements during a rebalance.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56604[MB-56604^]
|When alter index updated the replica count, new replicas were not built immediately when the original definition was
{`defer_build`: true}. Existing replicas were built and new replicas were built in the next processing iteration.
|New replicas are now built when the replica count is updated for deferred indexes. The status of existing index instances is checked, and if ready, a new build of the instance is triggered.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57135[MB-57135^]
|Watcher threads were created by metadata_provider during rebalance but were not cleaned up.
|Threads are now closed after rebalance is finished.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57295[MB-57295^]
|Indexer contained incorrect logic to identify active indexer nodes during a multi-service rebalance. This caused potential downtime and failures in index creation, builds, or other DDL operations.
|The information used by TranslatePort has been updated to use the node Services endpoint to correct this issue.

|===

==== Data Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-dataservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-53898[MB-53898^]
|When expired documents were identified during compaction, the Data Service queued a read of the documents' metadata as part of expiry processing. No upper bound was imposed on the size of this queue. This could result in exceeding the Bucket quota for workloads when large amounts of documents expired in a short time.
|Metadata reads for TTL processing are not now queued. Instead, they are processed inline. Consequently, Bucket quota is no longer exceeded.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-55268[MB-55268^]
|A shared allocation cache (tcache) between buckets resulted in a stats drift. This caused higher-than-normal memory fragmentation.
|Dedicated tcaches are now used for buckets. jemalloc has been changed to support increased numbers of tcaches.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-55943[MB-55943^]
|Workloads involving bulk data ingestion or Time-To-Live (TTLs) expiring at the same time caused a sudden increase in memory fragmentation.
|The defragmenter now runs more frequently to better cope with sudden increases in fragmentation.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56084[MB-56084^]
|A rollback loop affected legacy clients when collections were used and a tombstone newer than the last mutation in the default collection was purged.
|The lastReadSeqno is now Incremented when the client is not collection-aware.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56644[MB-56644^]
|In rare cases, after a failover or memcached restart, a replica rollback while under memory pressure might have caused a crash in the Data Service.
|Memory pressure recovery logic (Item expelling) is now skipped when replica rollback is in progress.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56970[MB-56970^]
|XDCR or restore from backup entered an endless loop if attempting to overwrite a document which was deleted or expired some time ago with a deleteWithMeta operation. This was due to a specific unanticipated state in memory which increased CPU usage, and connection became unusable for further operations.
|deleteWithMeta is now resilient to temporary non-existent values with xattr datatype.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57002[MB-57002^]
|When using .NET SDK on Windows 10 client and client certs were enabled on CB Server, the Data-Service did not establish a connection and client bootstrap failed with a OpenSSL â€œsession id context uninitialized" error.
|Data-Service has been updated to disable TLS session resume.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57064[MB-57064^]
|GET_META requests for deleted items fetched metadata in memory which was not        evicted in value-eviction buckets.
|Metadata items are now cleaned when the expiry pager runs.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57106[MB-57106^]
|DCP clients streamed in OSO backfill snapshots under Magma observed duplicate documents received in the disk snapshot. This happened where the stream was paused and resumed when the resume point was wrongly set to a key already processed in the stream.
|OSO backfill in Magma now sets the correct resume point after a pause.

|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-eventingservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57138[MB-57138^]
|A server regression in version 7.1.2 might have caused a cURL request encoding issue.
|The default behavior has now been reverted to that in version 7.1.0. In addition, there's now an optional argument, "url_encode_version", with potential values of [6.6.2, 7.1.0, and 7.2.0]. This argument facilitates the selection of an encoding scheme during upgrades if necessary.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57164[MB-57164^]
|The eventing producer process terminated the eventing consumer process when it did not receive a heartbeat from the consumer process.
|The message receiver loop routine now only exits upon receiving a proper termination command.

|===

==== Analytics Service

[#table-fixed-issues-715-analyticsservice,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56957[MB-56957^]
|External collections could not be created using Azure Managed Identity.
|Azure dependencies have been updated to correct this issue.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57588[MB-57588^]
|Query results could be unnecessarily converted twice to JSON when documents were large.
|The Query result is now converted to JSON once for all documents.

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57615[MB-57615^]
|When the Prometheus stats returned from Analytics exceeded four kilobytes, the status code was inadvertently set to 500 (Internal Error), and this resulted in a large number of warnings in the Analytics warning log. Couchbase Server discarded these statistics.
|This has been fixed to properly return a 200 (OK) status code when the size of Prometheus stats exceeds 4KiB, allowing these stats to be recorded properly. The warning is not displayed.

|===

==== Storage

[#table-fixed-issues-715-storage,cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

|https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57156[MB-57156^]
|Inconsistencies were observed where a single Magma bucket in a database took a long time to warm up.
|The seq index scan has been optimized for tombstones of zero value size. Optimization is for look up by key, sequence iteration, and key iteration. Docs of 0 value size are placed in both key index and seq index.

[#release-710]
== Release 7.1 (May 2022)

Couchbase Server 7.1 was released in May 2022.
This release contains new features, enhancements, and fixes.

[#new-features-improvements-710]
=== New Features

This section highlights the notable new features and improvements in this release.

* Analytics shadow data may now be replicated up to 3 times to ensure high availability.
Refer to xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General Settings].

* Analytics now supports Analytics views and tabular Analytics views.
Refer to xref:analytics:5a_views.adoc[].

* The new Tableau Connector provides integration between tabular Analytics views and the Tableau interactive data visualization platform.
Refer to xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[].

* The Analytics Service now supports external datasets on Azure Blob storage.
Refer to xref:analytics:manage-links.adoc[] and xref:analytics:rest-links.adoc[].

* Analytics now supports array indexes.
Refer to xref:analytics:7_using_index.adoc[] and xref:analytics:5_ddl.adoc[].

* The cost-based optimizer may now consider different join orders, and can choose the optimal join order based on cost information.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/cost-based-optimizer.adoc#join-enumeration[Join Enumeration].

* The Query service now supports optimizer hints within queries using a specially-formatted hint comment.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[].

* Couchbase Server now permits multiple root certificates to maintained in a _trust store_ for the cluster.
See xref:learn:security/using-multiple-cas.adoc[Using Multiple Root Certificates].

* Couchbase Server now supports _PKCS #1_ and _PKCS #8_ &#8212; in each case, only for use with private keys.
See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#private-key-formats[Private Key Formats].

* Use of encrypted private keys is now supported for certificate management.
Registration procedures are provided for encrypted private keys associated with node-certificates.
See xref:rest-api:upload-retrieve-node-cert.adoc#json-passphrase-registration[JSON Passphrase Registration].

* _System Events_ are now provided, to record significant events on the cluster.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/system-events.adoc[System Events].

* New roles are provided for the administration of _Sync Gateway_, especially in the context of Couchbase Capella.
These roles are listed at xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

* TLS 1.3 cipher-suites can now by used by all services; and by the Cluster Manager, XDCR, and Views.
See xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc[On the Wire Security].

* Heightened security is now provided for adding nodes to clusters.
Once  a cluster is using uploaded certificates, a node that is to be added must itself be provisioned with conformant certificates before addition can be successfully performed.
The new node is now always added over an encrypted connection.
See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#adding-new-nodes[Adding and Joining New Nodes].

* The scalability of indexing is enhanced by the _flattening_ of arrays.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc#query-predicate-format[Format of Query Predicate].

* Automatic failover can now fail over more than three nodes concurrently.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].
This improvement has permitted the removal of pre-7.1 interfaces that were specific to triggering _auto-failover for server groups_.
Consequently, in order now to ensure successful auto-failover of a server group, the maximum count for auto-failover must be established by the administrator as a value equal to or greater than the number of nodes in the server group.
+
Note that the pre-7.1 interfaces for triggering auto-failover for server groups have been _removed_ from 7.1: therefore, programs that attempt to use the pre-7.1 interfaces with 7.1+ will _fail_.
+
Note also that in 7.1, automatic failover of the Index Service is supported.
+
Updated interfaces for 7.1+ are documented in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#node-availability[Node Availability], xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-autofailover-enable.adoc[Enabling and Disabling Auto-Failover], and xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-autofailover-settings.adoc[Retrieving Auto-Failover Settings].

* Improvements have been made to rebalancing algorithms so that active buckets, services, and replicas will be spread across different server groups, even when server groups are unequal.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server Group Awareness].

* The Magma Storage Engine has been added to 7.1 as an Enterprise Edition feature, allowing for higher performance with very large datasets.
Magma is a disk-based engine, so is highly suited to datasets that will not fit in available memory.
You can find more details on Magma in xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage-engines.adoc[Storage Engines].

* The Eventing Service now has full RBAC support allowing non-administrative users to create and manage Eventing Functions subject to the user's assigned resource privileges.
You can find more details on Magma RBAC in xref:eventing:eventing-rbac.adoc[Eventing Role-Based Access Control].

* The Index Service now uses _smart batching_ to reduce the time and resources required to move index metadata, and to rebuild indexes at their new locations during rebalance.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#smart-batching[Smart Batching].

[#enhacements-710]
=== Enhancements

The following enhancements are provided in this release:

* The Analytics function `object_concat` has been updated to support dynamic uses, similar to the more general OBJECT constructor functionality that is available in the Query Service.
Refer to xref:analytics:8_builtin.adoc#object_concat[object_concat].

* XDCR checkpointing is now entirely persistent through topology-changes on the source cluster.
This provides improved performance when failover and rebalance occur on the source cluster.

* The Plasma Storage Engine has been enhanced with _per page Bloom filters_ and _in-memory compression_.
For information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#plasma-memory-enhancements[Plasma Memory Enhancements].

* Root and intermediate certificates can now be managed while node-to-node encryption is enabled.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc#certificate-rotation-and-node-to-node-encryption[Certificate Management and Node-to-Node Encryption].

[#supported-platforms-710]

{supported-platforms-url}

[#deprecated-features-and-platforms-710]
== Deprecated Features and Platforms

=== Deprecated and Removed Platforms

The following platforms are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* Apple macOS v10.14 (Mojave) â€“ removed
* Apple macOS v10.15 (Catalina) â€“ deprecated
* CentOS 7.x â€“ deprecated
* CentOS 8.x â€“ removed
* Debian 9.x â€“ removed
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016 â€“ removed
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016 (64-bit, DataCenter Edition) â€“ removed
* Oracle Linux 7.x â€“ deprecated
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.x â€“ deprecated
* Ubuntu 18.x â€“ deprecated

=== Deprecation of Certificate Upload API

The `POST` method and `/controller/uploadClusterCA` URI, which historically have been used to upload an appropriately configured certificate to the cluster, so that it becomes the root certificate for the cluster, are _deprecated_ in 7.1.

For security reasons, in versions 7.1 and after, by default, this method and URI can continue to be used on _localhost_ only.
However, this default setting can be changed, if required.
For details, see xref:rest-api:deprecated-security-apis/deprecated-certificate-management-apis.adoc[Deprecated Certificate Management APIs].

Note that new methods and URIs for certificate management are summarized on the page xref:rest-api:rest-certificate-management.adoc[Certificate Management API].

=== Removal of pre-7.1 Server-Group Auto-Failover Interfaces

_Automatic failover_ can now fail over more than three nodes concurrently: this improvement has permitted the removal of pre-7.1 interfaces that were specific to triggering _auto-failover for server groups_.
Consequently, in 7.1+, in order to ensure successful auto-failover of a server group, the maximum count for auto-failover must be established by the administrator as a value equal to or greater than the number of nodes in the server group.

Note that the pre-7.1 interfaces for triggering auto-failover for server groups have been _removed_ from 7.1: therefore, programs that attempt to use the pre-7.1 interfaces with 7.1+ will _fail_.

An overview of auto-failover is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].
Updated interfaces for 7.1+ are documented in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#node-availability[Node Availability], xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-autofailover-enable.adoc[Enabling and Disabling Auto-Failover], and xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-autofailover-settings.adoc[Retrieving Auto-Failover Settings].
