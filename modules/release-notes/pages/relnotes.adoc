[#major-changes-in-behavior-700]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

* With the introduction of scopes and collections, Couchbase Server stores documents in a collection, which are contained in a scope, which is in a bucket. A default scope and default collection is used when a named scope and collection is not available or has not yet been created.
When you upgrade to version 7.0 from a previous version, your documents will be available in the default scope and default collection. The migration guide provides information on how to migrate your data from a previous version of Couchbase to take advantage of named scopes and collections.
** Global secondary indexes need to be created for each collection. 

* Added support for out-of-order execution of operations. 
+
When an operation takes a long time, this enhancement enables looking ahead in the queue and swapping for an operation that's faster. The durability out-of-order execution behavior is enabled by default and you can choose to disable it. See Java SDK documentation for further information.

* Global secondary indexes now supports concurrent builds. 

* Keeping in line with recommendation from the PCI council, we strongly recommend that clients which use TLS encryption support TLS 1.2, and have updated the default minimum TLS version for new clusters to TLS 1.2. 
+ 
If you do need to configure the minimum TLS to a lower version (not recommended), follow the instructions provided in https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/manage-tls.html#set-the-minimum-tls-version.

* Updated license for Community Edition
The Community Edition of the product has an updated license with the following changes:
** Individual cluster sizes are limited to five (5) cluster nodes
** Cross datacenter replication (XDCR) will be available only in the Enterprise Edition.

* CentOS 8
* macOS 10.14 (Mojave)
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016

The following platforms are removed and no longer available: 

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

[#deprecated-features]
==== Deprecated and Removed Features

* The 'cbdocloader' tool used to load sample datasets is deprecated in this release. You can use the 'cbimport' tool with the '--format sample' flag as the 'cbimport' tool provides an equivalent feature set and is collection-aware.

* The MOSS index type, available in the full-text search service, is deprecated in this release.

* Support for passwordless buckets in the query service is deprecated.

* The search_query() function is deprecated. We recommend that you use Search() functions instead to run full text search queries directly within a N1QL query. Refer to https://blog.couchbase.com/n1ql-and-search-how-to-leverage-fts-index-in-n1ql-query/ for information on changing the syntax to leverage the Search() function. 

[#known-issues-700]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v700-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-46660[MB-46660^]
| *Summary*: The average disconnect time has increased from 8 seconds to 30 seconds.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45973[MB-46646^]
| *Summary*: Quorum failover on a remote cluster requires manual intervention. Not performing these manual steps causes the results to vary based on which nodes the Analytics service is talking to, and the state of those nodes.  

*Workaround*: Following a quorum failover on a remote cluster, perform the following manual steps:
. Run `DISCONNECT LINK` if the remote link is still connected.
. Run `ALTER LINK` to update the link to point to a surviving node. This step is needed even if the previously specified host is still in the cluster as it resets the topology maintained in the metadata.
. Run `CONNECT LINK`.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45996[MB-45996^]
| *Summary*: The Analytics service crashes when ingesting maximum size documents (20MB) with minimally-sized Analytics memory quota as the memory consumed during ingestion is not released until the link is disconnected.

*Workaround*: Using smaller documents, increasing the Analytics service memory quota, or disconnecting the link before running queries can help avoid running into this issue.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44849[MB-44849^]
| *Summary*: Dangling remote shadows are not connected on permission restoration.

*Workaround*: Re-establish the connection by running `CONNECT LINK` manually.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_knownissues_v700-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38978[MB-38978^]
| *Summary*:  Under certain circumstances, such as running a cbcollect_info, requests may take longer than normal. Depending on the system workload and size, this may be even a few seconds, which can trigger the default timeout value from SDKs. 

*Workaround*: We recommend that you avoid gathering these stats or cbcollect_info during higher workload.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_knownissues_v700-gsi,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-46725[MB-46725^]
| *Summary*: In the case of an unsafe failover that removes one or more index nodes from the cluster, the *Rebalance* button on the UI may not be enabled even though some indexes or index partitions are not available because the remaining index node(s) did not have any of their replicas.

*Workaround*: Issue a rebalance command via CLI `couchbase-cli rebalance -c 127.0.0.1:8091 -u Administrator -p xxxxxx`
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v700-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45973[MB-45973^]
| *Summary*:  After upgrading from version 6.6 to 7.0, Eventing timers are not triggered as expected.
