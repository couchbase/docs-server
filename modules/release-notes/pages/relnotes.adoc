[#release-512]
== Release 5.1.2

Couchbase Server 5.1.2 was released in September 2018.
This is the second maintenance release in the 5.1.x series of Couchbase Server and includes bug fixes to the storage, secondary indexing, query, and installer components.

[#fixed-issues-512]
=== Fixed Issues
Listed below are the notable fixes in this release. The complete list of issues fixed in this release is available https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31077?filter=16283&jql=project%20%3D%20MB%20AND%20issuetype%20in%20(Bug%2C%20Improvement%2C%20Task)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%205.1.2%20and%20labels%20in%20(releasenote)[here].

==== Index Service

[#table_fixedissues_index_512,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31077[MB-31077^]
| If the memory usage of the index nodes is close to quota, during rebalance, some of the index replicas may not get repaired when an index node is rebalanced out of the cluster. In release 5.1.2, the replicas will always be repaired. This issue is applicable only for the standard secondary storage mode.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30582[MB-30582^]
| In previous releases, the automatic upgrade from ForestDB to Plasma storage lead to the restart of the index service when the last node was upgraded. This caused the unavailability of indexes during the warmup phase. This issue has fixed in this release, and the index service restart and the subsequent index unavailability is no longer observed during storage upgrade.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30581[MB-30581^]
| The authentication requests from projector to Memcached now have a fixed timeout to avoid infinite wait time.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30509[MB-30509^]
| In previous releases, the memory consumption of the index service could exceed the index serviceâ€™s RAM quota setting. This caused problems when the quota was set to an amount that was close to the physical RAM on the Server node, for example this could lead to an out of memory error. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30480[MB-30480^]
| The initial index build has been optimized by reducing the storage operations during the initial build.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30479[MB-30479^]
| The secondary index rebalance now builds indexes in smaller batches, in sequence. The default number of indexes per batch is set to 3 and the batching does not follow any specific criteria. The rebalance operation will randomly batch together 3 indexes for the build.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30457[MB-30457^]
| The robustness of an index rebalance operation when vBuckets are moving around has been improved.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30233[MB-30233^]
| Fixed an issue where the index service could crash when trying to index a large composite array index key due to buffer overflow.
|===

==== Install
[#table_fixedissues_install_512,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30413[MB-30413^]
| Uninstalling Couchbase Server on a Debian-based systemd distribution such as Ubuntu 16 using `apt-get remove` and then running `systemctl status couchbase-server` reported that the service still exists but is "masked". This means the service was explicitly disabled in such a way that it could not be started, automatically or by hand. As a result, subsequent installations of any version of Couchbase Server failed as the service was rendered unstartable.
|===

==== Query

[#table_fixedissues_query_512,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30946[MB-30946^]
| An empty array in the index scan caused incorrect results. This was observed when the `scan_cap` parameter was set to a small number (say 2) and thus, backfill was used.

=== Fixed Issues

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_index_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30870[MB-30870^]
| During warmup, one of the indexes with low number of items triggered an issue and caused the internal garbage collector to run forever.
Thus causing the entire index service to stall during warmup.
This issue was observed when using Plasma storage engine.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30823[MB-30823^]
| Fixed an issue where the index service crashed with a "slice bounds out of range"  error.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-2xxxx[MB-30672^]
| Fixed an issue where upgrading from 4.x to 5.x version of Couchbase Server caused an outage for GSI standard indexes.
This was observed during rolling upgrade from ForestDB to Plasma.
When the last ForestDB index service node was taken out of the cluster, the cluster compatibility mode changed to Plasma and the index service restarted.

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_install_551,cols="25,66"]

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30413[MB-30413^]

[#table_fixedissues_tools-ui_551,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30636[MB-30636^]
| Fixed an issue where an unexpected token error was seen when accessing the Web Console in Couchbase Server version 5.5.0.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30589[MB-30589^]
| Fixed an issue where the warning message on the Web Console showed an incorrect flag for the removal of dedicated bucket port as `--remove-port` instead of `--remove-bucket-port`.
|===

==== Query

[#table_change-behavior,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28778[MB-28778^]
| The default number of Data Service worker threads has been increased; from 3/4 of the number of available CPU threads, to 7/8 of the number of available CPU threads (minimum of 4 in both cases).
This makes better use of the available CPU resource, particularly on larger systems, as such users may see an increase in CPU utilization on such systems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28417[MB-28417^]
| The permissions assigned to the cluster_admin role have been downgraded.
As a result, The cluster_admin role no longer has FTS write permissions used to create FTS searches.

_Workaround_: Add the *fts_admin* role as required.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27173[MB-27173^]
| Prior to 5.5, the [.cmd]`mctimings` command defined the _request start_ as the time when the 24 byte request header had been read by the Data Service.
However, many requests contain a _body_ which also needs to be read before a request can be processed.
As such, the reported duration didn't accurately reflect how long the server actually spent processing a request, if it was still waiting for the body to be received from the network.

In 5.5, the definition of _request start_ has been changed to be when the header _and_ body have both been read.
This has the effect of more accurately reflecting the time spent by the Data Service in servicing a request, as the time the body spends in transit over the network is no longer included.
As a result command timings for affected request will have shorter durations compared to how they were measured before 5.5.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27060[MB-27060^]
| The Couchbase Server 5.5 Windows installer package no longer bundles the DLL [.path]_dbghelp.dll_ which is required by Breakpad to produce dumps on Windows platforms.
Starting version 5.5, Breakpad will pick the DLL (dbghelp.dll) that is shipped with the OS.

[#v510-fixed-issues]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

. Disable the entire IPv6 protocol stack - typically by adding a boot-time grub parameter: `ipv6.disable=1`.
. Disable assignment of IPv6 addresses to interfaces - either by setting the boot-time grub parameter: `ipv6.disable_ipv6=1`, or dynamically by setting the appropriate `net.ipv6.conf` sysctl properties.

Only the first method to disable IPv6 will cause Memcached to not start correctly.
As a workaround you can disable IPv6 using the second method instead.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: The data node is in a pending state after memcached crashes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809^]

It was possible for a rebalance of the Analytics nodes to always fail if:

* a bucket was in the disconnected state, and
* the Analytics nodes were at different DCP states.

In that case a common DCP state (required for rebalancing) could not be achieved as no new DCP mutations were received by the Analytics nodes.
