[#release-700]
== Release 7.0.0 (July 2021)

Couchbase Server 7.0 was released in July 2021.

_Quick Links_: <<major-changes-in-behavior-700>> | <<supported-platforms-700>> | <<known-issues-700>> | <<fixed-issues-700>> | <<common-vulnerabilities-exposures-700>>

[#major-changes-in-behavior-700]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

* With the introduction of scopes and collections, Couchbase Server stores documents in a collection, which are contained in a scope, which is in a bucket. A default scope and default collection is used when a named scope and collection is not available or has not yet been created.
When you upgrade to version 7.0 from a previous version, your documents and indexes will be available in the default scope and default collection. The migration guide provides information on how to migrate your data from a previous version of Couchbase to take advantage of named scopes and collections.
** Global secondary indexes need to be created for each collection.

* Added support for out-of-order execution of operations in Data Service.
+
When a Data Service request cannot be completed immediately, this enhancement enables looking ahead in the connection's queue and starting work on the next request. Out-of-order execution behavior is enabled by default and you can choose to disable it. See xref:java-sdk:ref:client-settings.adoc#unordered-executions[Java SDK documentation] for further information.

* Global secondary indexes now supports concurrent creation of indexes.

* The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have formally deprecated both the TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols along with a wider industry movement to use newer, more secure standards. Keeping in line with these changes, we strongly recommend that clients which use TLS encryption use TLS 1.2 or higher, and have updated the default minimum TLS version for all Couchbase Server 7.0 clusters to TLS 1.2.  Currently supported SDKs already support the TLS 1.2 standard, so in most cases no application changes are required.
+
If you do need to configure the minimum TLS to a lower version (not recommended), follow the instructions provided in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc[].
The minimum TLS can be configured through the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-cli[CLI] or through the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-rest-api[REST-API].

* Updated license for Community Edition
+
Couchbase Server comes in two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. You can find details on the differences between the two and licensing information on the Couchbase Server Editions page.
+
** Enterprise Edition -- The Enterprise Edition license provides for free for development and testing for Couchbase Enterprise Edition. A paid subscription for production deployment is required. Please refer to the https://www.couchbase.com/pricing[pricing] page for details on Couchbase’s Enterprise Edition.
+
** Community Edition -- The Community Edition license provides for free deployment of Couchbase Community Edition for departmental-scale deployments of up to five node clusters.  It has recently been changed to disallow use of XDCR, which is now an exclusive Enterprise Edition feature.

[#supported-platforms-700]
=== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the following platforms:

* macOS Big Sur for development only

See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

[#deprecation-700]
=== Deprecated Features and Platforms

==== Deprecated and Removed Platforms

The following platforms are deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* CentOS 8
* macOS 10.14 (Mojave)
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016

The following platforms are removed and no longer available:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

[#deprecated-features]
==== Deprecated and Removed Features

* The tree view has been removed from the Query Workbench.

* The 'cbdocloader' tool used to load sample datasets is deprecated in this release. You can use the 'cbimport' tool with the '--format sample' flag as the 'cbimport' tool provides an equivalent feature set and is collection-aware.

* The MOSS index type, available in the full-text search service, is deprecated in this release.

* Support for passwordless buckets,typically buckets from previously upgraded clusters (pre-5.x), is deprecated.

* The old bucket `sasl_password` is deprecated in this release.

* The search_query() function is deprecated. We recommend that you use Search() functions instead to run full text search queries directly within a N1QL query. Refer to https://blog.couchbase.com/n1ql-and-search-how-to-leverage-fts-index-in-n1ql-query/ for information on changing the syntax to leverage the Search() function.

* Views are deprecated in Couchbase Server 7.0+.
+
Views support in Couchbase Server will be removed in a future release only when the core functionality of the View engine is covered by other services. Views will continue to work in all buckets but only in the default scope and default collection.
+
There is no current impact to the View engine, Views REST API, or any direct MapReduce View implementations as described in xref:learn:views/views-query-samples.adoc[View and Query Examples], where you can still create Views from the Query Workbench.

* View indexes in N1QL have been removed in this release.
+
Starting from this release, you can no longer use `CREATE INDEX USING VIEW` in N1QL. Note that this change only disallows the ability to create indexes _using views_.

* The Data-Service histogram 'batch_read' has been removed. Use the existing 'bg_load' histogram instead to monitor background fetch durations.

a| *Summary*: Quorum failover on a remote cluster requires manual intervention. Not performing these manual steps causes the results to vary based on which nodes the Analytics service is talking to, and the state of those nodes.

*Workaround*: Following a quorum failover on a remote cluster, perform the following manual steps:

. Run `DISCONNECT LINK` if the remote link is still connected.
. Run `ALTER LINK` to update the link to point to a surviving node. This step is needed even if the previously specified host is still in the cluster as it resets the topology maintained in the metadata.
. Run `CONNECT LINK` to reconnect the link.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45996[MB-45996^]
| *Summary*: The Analytics service may run out of heap space when ingesting maximum size documents (20MB) with minimally-sized Analytics memory quota as some memory that is consumed during ingestion is not released until the link is disconnected.

*Workaround*: Use smaller documents, increase the Analytics service memory quota, or disconnect the link before running queries to avoid this issue.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44849[MB-44849^]
| *Summary*: A Remote Collection that gets disconnected due to the loss of permissions is not reconnected if the permissions are re-established.

*Workaround*: Re-establish the connection by running `CONNECT LINK` manually.

==== Data Service

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-47267[MB-47267^]
| *Summary*: Clusters with a large number of high capacity persistent buckets, delta node recovery may timeout, due to large persistent bucket's warmup tasks being scheduled before the initial tasks of warmup for other buckets.

*Workaround*: Increase the number of reader threads to reduce the likelihood of smaller bucket's warmup tasks being delayed from running.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38978[MB-38978^]
| *Summary*: Under certain circumstances, such as running a cbcollect_info, requests may take longer than normal. Depending on the system workload and size, this may be even a few seconds, which can trigger the default timeout value from SDKs.

*Workaround*: We recommend that you avoid gathering these stats or cbcollect_info during higher workload.

==== Eventing Service

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45973[MB-45973^]
| *Summary*:  After upgrading a cluster with a single Data node from version 6.6 to 7.0, Eventing timers are not triggered as expected after a swap rebalance to version 7.0. Note that this does not impact clusters with 2 or more data nodes, or when there are no deployed or paused Eventing Functions with timers.

*Workaround*: Undeploy all Eventing Functions that use timers, or add a second Data node before upgrading to version 7.0 (which can be subsequently be removed after the upgrade is complete).


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45785[MB-45785^]
| *Summary*: A race condition exists where an Eventing Function with a Feed Boundary set to "From now" sometimes ignores it's checkpoint and resumes processing form Everything. This issue only impacts the UI and can occur when a user rapidly invokes pause, edit, or resume in succession.

*Workaround*: The issue can be avoided by using the REST APIs to pause and resume Eventing Functions in production.

==== Index Service

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-46725[MB-46725^]
| *Summary*: In the case of an unsafe failover that removes one or more index nodes from the cluster, the *Rebalance* button on the UI may not be enabled even though some indexes or index partitions are not available because the remaining index node(s) did not have any of their replicas.

*Workaround*: Issue a rebalance command via CLI `couchbase-cli rebalance -c 127.0.0.1:8091 -u Administrator -p xxxxxx`

==== Install and Deploy

[#table_knownissues_v700-install-deploy,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-47806[MB-47806^]
a| *Summary*: When installing Couchbase Server on Windows, you must be logged into an account with Administrator privileges.

For Couchbase Server 7.0.1 and earlier versions, if you are logged in to an account other than the built-in Administrator account, an error is thrown during installation if you attempt to install into a directory under `C:\Program Files`. You must change the installation directory to something under your user's home directory.

If you must install into `C:\Program Files`, and cannot log in to the built-in Administrator account (this account is disabled by default on Windows 10), the workaround is to take the following steps:

. Click the Start button and type `cmd`.
. Right-click on `Command Prompt` and select `Run as administrator`.
. At the command prompt, `cd` into the directory with the downloaded .msi and type `call couchbase-server-enterprise_7.0.0-windows_amd64.msi`.

==== Views

[#table_knownissues_v700-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-47094[MB-47094^]
| *Summary*: When request auditing is enabled in a Couchbase cluster, under very high Views query workload, the view-engine audit message queue may grow unbounded causing the view-engine to crash.

*Workaround*: Disable auditing when Views are present in the cluster.
