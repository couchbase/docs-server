==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v661-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43272[MB-43272^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing Metadata bucket is not being cleared when handlers are undeployed from the paused state. If the handler is using timers, this can also result in timers not being removed as expected, that can then fire and execute on a subsequent deployment.  

*Workaround*: Do not undeploy handlers from the paused state.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43343[MB-43343^]
| *Summary*: Handlers can hang in the deploying state due to a race condition during rebalance-in of an Eventing node. 

*Workaround*: Ensure that you pause handlers before any rebalance.

[#fixed-issues-661]
=== Fixed Issues

This section highlights the notable issues fixed in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40727[MB-40727^]
| *Summary*: After upgrading to 6.6.1 a rebalance might be required to repair composite secondary indexes that contain NULL or MISSING.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40693[MB-40693^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Analytics service threw an error when creating a link from an IPv4 configured cluster to an IPv6 configured cluster.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40576[MB-40576^]
| *Summary*: If an identifier for a metadata entity (e.g. a dataverse or a dataset) contained characters that require URL encoding (percent-encoding) when used in a URI, requests that used this identifier failed with an URISyntaxException. This has been fixed.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v661-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41183[MB-41183^]
| *Summary*: For audit events from memcached, "peername" and "sockname" have been renamed to "local" and "remote" with the syntax: {"ip":"hostname","port":1234}.
|===

==== Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_v661-xdcr,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41239[MB-41239^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the user intent heuristic was incorrect for full-encryption when XDCR reference did not provide a port number.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40847[MB-40847^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an incorrect XDCR stream request rollback caused by a consumer ahead of producer error.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41866[MB-41866^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an infinite loop due to HdrHistogram being reset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41089[MB-41089^]
| *Summary*: The HTCleaner in Ephemeral is responsible for purging tombstones and also Completed (Committed / Aborted) SyncWrites. A bug in that component led to removing in-flight SyncWrites from internal data-structures, which would cause a crash on the node when/if it tried to complete the SyncWrite.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42167[MB-42167^]
| *Summary*: The `api/v1/list/functions` returned incorrect list of handler names. This has been fixed by updating the bucket function map after storing in the primary store.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41940[MB-41940^]
| *Summary*: The Web Console UI did not display the very first line of Eventing logs and has been fixed. (Note that the logs files in the file system contained the correct information without any truncation). 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41509[MB-41509^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Eventing debugger crashed when using toLocaleString in JS.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41091[MB-41091^]
| *Summary*: The debugger link has been updated, from `chrome-devtools://` to `devtools://`,  to adapt to different Chrome versions.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40945[MB-40945^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an exception thrown when data sent in the request body to deploy a handler was null. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40731[MB-40731^]
| *Summary*: Fixed the function handler so that a paused handler can only be resumed using `/resume`. Previously, it was possible to resume a paused handler using `/deploy`.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40637[MB-40637^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where upon upgrading from version 6.0.x to 6.6, a handler that uses N1qlQuery would stop working on nodes that were upgraded and threw an error (`ReferenceError: N1qlQuery is not defined`) when it hit the line that calls N1qlQuery. With this fix, handlers will continue to work the same way in older and newer nodes.  

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40636[MB-40636^]
| *Summary*: Improved automation of failover handling in Eventing service in several scenarios.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40522[MB-40522^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where delete mutation on a `src` bucket from OnUpdate() was not suppressed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40518[MB-40518^]
| *Summary*: Eventing service was not retrying bucket ops failures that were retryable like ETMPFAIL that could be retried. This has been fixed and will now retry until the script timeout.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40357[MB-40357^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue so that a function action does not deploy and execute on mutations after a REST API validation error.
|===

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v661-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43231[MB-43231^]
| *Summary*: Starting with version 6.5.0, VbSeqnosReader has been updated to process two types of requests: VbSeqnosRequest and VbMinSeqnosRequest. When processing VbSeqnosRequest, if there are any VbMinSeqnosRequest's, then the VbMinSeqnosRequest's will be queued back into the requestCh of VbSeqnosReader. However, if the VbSeqnosReader closed by this time, then enqueue would fail and the caller would be waiting for a response indefinitely. This has been fixed to respond to outstanding requests upon exit of VbSeqnosReader.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42614[MB-42614^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where rebalance failed due to timestamp mismatch between snapshots.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42108[MB-42108^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where multiple partition tombstones for an index during rebalance could lead to partition cleanup on restart.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41722[MB-41722^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue in the waitForIndexBuild routine which caused it not to terminate at the end of the batch and remain active till the end of rebalance. As a result, rebalance caused a very large number of TIME_WAIT connections and subsequently failed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41673[MB-41673^]
| *Summary*: Added per index `memory_used` statistic to the `api/v1/stats` endpoint to enable memory accounting.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41672[MB-41672^]
| *Summary*: The statistic `pauseTotalNs` has been added to the `api/v1/stats` endpoint and enables you to monitor any spikes in GC between two intervals. `PauseTotalNs` is a cumulative statistic that represents the total time an indexer process has been paused for GC since it's inception.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41645[MB-41645^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the gsi index resident ratio showed a value greater than 100% due to num_rec_swapin being larger than num_rec_swapout (num_rec_swapin > num_rec_swapout). This is a rare and transient condition that may occur sometimes as the stats are updated asynchronously and will become correct eventually.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41641[MB-41641^]
| *Summary*: Improved array indexing performance by optimizing the ComputeArrayEntriesWithCount method.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41717[MB-41717^]
| *Summary*: When bloomDelta is added after recovery when page is found without a bloom filter, the stat NumRecordAllocs is over counted. However, NumRecordAllocs is only supposed to track the insert/delete deltas. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41155[MB-41155^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue with memory optimized indexes where indefinite disk snapshotting led to increasing disk usage.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40127[MB-40127^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a memory growth issue observed when processing many metadata operations.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40120[MB-40120^]
| *Summary*: Log replay will skip data blocks if a more recent header was already recovered by checkpoint recovery. When skipping the stale data blocks, page op stats due to that stale data block were not being cleared and the stats kept accumulating. This caused incorrect stats for PageBytes and ItemCnt after recovery. This has been fixed by discarding page ops stats during log replay.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40042[MB-40042^]
| *Summary*: Index creation failed when the bucket name contained a `%` character. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40016[MB-40016^]
| *Summary*: The projector went into a stream termination loop when trying to stream a near 20 MB document due to redundant doc size checks in projector. This has been fixed.
|===

==== Install and Deploy

[#table_fixedissues_v661-install-deploy,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-MB-42079[MB-42079^]
| *Summary*: On Windows, when upgrading to 6.6.1 or later from any earlier version, configuration changes such as custom data directories may be lost. To avoid this, before running the MSI installer, copy the file `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\etc\runtime.ini` to a new file named `runtime{{.ini-hold}}` in the same directory. This path may be different if you installed Server into a non-standard directory.

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41605[MB-41605^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the intersect scan under inner of nested-loop join sometimes returned incorrect results.
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_fixedissues_v661-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41854[MB-41854^]
| *Summary*: The percentage completion stat for Search service did not reflect updates in the UI. This has been fixed.
|===

==== Tools, Web Console (UI), and REST API

[#table_fixedissues_v661-tools-ui-rest-api,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40354[MB-40354^]
| *Summary*: There is a rare case where `cbbackupmgr backup` would crash instead of exiting gracefully and reporting the error. This could only happen at the start of a backup if the connection to Data Service was lost. This has now been fixed in 6.6.1.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40209[MB-40209^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where `couchbase-cli analytics-link-setup` failed on a single node cluster configured to use loopback (127.0.0.1)ß.

[#release-660]
== Release 6.6.0 (August 2020)

Couchbase Server 6.6 was released in August 2020.

_Quick Links_: <<supported-platforms-660>> | <<deprecation-660>> | <<known-issues-660>> | <<fixed-issues-660>>

[#changes-in-behavior-660]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

* Search queries from N1QL
+
Previously, for SEARCH queries from N1QL, you could use any analyzer for queries that do not use an analyzer (Term, Phrase, Multiphrase, Fuzzy, Prefix, Regexp, WildCard queries). However, this caused inconsistent results between covered and non-covered queries. To ensure consistent results with covering and non-covering index queries, a keyword analyzer for queries that don't use an analyzer is mandated.

[#supported-platforms-660]
=== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the following platforms:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.2

See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

[#deprecation-660]
=== Deprecated Features and Platforms

==== Deprecated and Removed Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 is deprecated.
* Debian 8 is no longer supported.
* Java Runtime Environment(JRE) Version 8 is no longer supported.  The Analytics Service requires JRE Version 11 or later to be installed.

==== Deprecated and Removed Features

* The cbbackup, cbrestore, and cbbackupwrapper utilities are deprecated in this release.

[#known-issues-660]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40727[MB-40727^]
| *Summary:* When creating a secondary index with composite fields, and one or more of these fields have a numeric type (int, double), the Analytics service may run into repeated ingestion failure when a document is updated such that the indexed numeric field value changes between a real value and NULL or MISSING.

*Workaround*:  To avoid running into this issue, make sure the indexed numeric fields always have values (i.e. not NULL or MISSING), or drop any composite fields indexes that have numeric fields.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40693[MB-40693^]
| *Summary:* The Analytics service throws an error when creating a link from an IPv4 configured cluster to an IPv6 configured cluster.

*Workaround*: Set the jvmArgs on the Analytics Service to "-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false" and restart the Analytics cluster. 
For example, `curl -u Administrator:password -X PUT 'http://localhost:8095/analytics/config/service' --data-urlencode 'jvmArgs=-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false'`.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40576[MB-40576^]
| *Summary:* If an identifier for a metadata entity (e.g. a dataverse or a dataset) contains characters that require URL encoding (percent-encoding) when used in a URI, requests that use this identifier can fail with an URISyntaxException.

*Workaround*: Construct identifiers using characters that do not require URL encoding.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40400[MB-40400^]
| *Summary:* When using alternate addresses for remote links, at least one node in the remote cluster must have the management[SSL] port exposed, and ALL data(KV) nodes have the kv[SSL] port exposed. Failure to do so will result in a 400 (Bad Request) when creating or altering a link. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39883[MB-39883^]
| *Summary:* Currently, the roles, `cluster_admin` and `bucket_admin`, are incorrectly allowed to read analytics data as the analytics permissions aren't explicitly excluded from the roles. The current xref:analytics:rest-analytics.adoc[Analytics REST API documentation] also mention that a `cluster_admin` can access several APIs and perform Analytics operations. 

However,these roles should not be able to read any data and this behavior is planned to be fixed in an upcoming release. Note that once the fix is implemented, the `cluster_admin` role will not be able to perform any Analytics operations, which may cause a backward compatibility issue.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36461[MB-36461^]
| *Summary:* In cases where the input to IN subclause with EVERY quantifier is MISSING or NULL, Analytics and Query engines differ in behavior. The Analytics service treats MISSING or NULL input values(in this case) as equivalent to an empty array, which results in the whole `EVERY … IN …` expression returning TRUE, while the Query service returns MISSING if the input is MISSING (or NULL if the input is NULL).

*Workaround*: Use the IS KNOWN predicate to test whether the IN value is not NULL/MISSING.
`WHERE (x IS KNOWN) AND (EVERY y IN x SATISFIES ... END)`
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39887[MB-39887^]
a| *Summary*: Using negate(NEG) match and match_phrase queries WITHOUT the “analyzer” setting can lead to no results being returned. This issue can happen for non-covered queries only when either of the following are NOT specified: 

* Index name in the options.
* Analyzer to use for the match query.

This is because, in such a non-covering query, the context of what index to use is missing in the verification phase and the default "standard" analyzer is used instead of the "keyword" analyzer which was used in the index. 

*Workaround*: Specify the analyzer to use with the non-covering queries, or the index name within the options explicitly.
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_knownissues_v660-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39990[MB-39990^]
| *Summary*: While adding support for explicit connections to IPv4, IPv6, or both for external communications for both HTTP and TLSUnique listeners, a considerable degradation in throughput was observed on Windows platform when using IPv6. This is caused by an https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40243[underlying issue in Golang].

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40009[MB-40009^]
| *Summary*: Following a KillAndRespawn restart, the "from-now" directive was ignored and started from 0 instead of the expected start from current sequence number. This has been fixed. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39878[MB-39878^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing service crashed due to a race condition between undeploy and delete. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39874[MB-39874^]
| *Summary*: To help distinguish slow performing queries from Eventing JavaScript code, Eventing service now adds a default clientContextId to every N1QL query fired from an Eventing function.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39713[MB-39713^]
| *Summary*: To avoid inter-function recursion through N1QL statements, Eventing service now performs recursion checks for static N1QL statements in Eventing functions.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39399[MB-39399^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the timer scan time kept increasing on an idle cluster with a timer handler.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39335[MB-39335^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the eventing consumer RSS did not honor Eventing memory quota for bucket operations with small documents.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39080[MB-39080^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where cbevent failed to run with localhost.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38793[MB-38793^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing log files permissions were excessively restrictive (0600), which prevented them from being processed by third-party tools. The log files permissions have been updated (0640). 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38731[MB-38731^]
| *Summary*: The Eventing status is now displayed right alongside the handlers in the web console(UI).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38729[MB-38729^]
| *Summary*: Added the ability to cancel timers.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38554[MB-38554^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where a timer created during a timer execution was not triggered.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38533[MB-38533^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where timers were not cancelled if multiple timers were created with the same reference.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38321[MB-38321^]
| *Summary*: When slow eventing functions were deployed first with feed boundary set to "everything", subsequent functions on the same source bucket were starved due to DCP backing up. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28734[MB-28734^]
| *Summary*: Eventing timers can now be cancelled using cancelTimer() function, or by creating a new timer with same reference as an existing timer. In addition, a function that is invoked by a timer callback can create fresh timers.

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v660-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39605[MB-39605^]
| *Summary*: To help troubleshoot memory usage issues with the storage engine, lastGCSn and currSn will now be exposed as MOI storage stats.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39512[MB-39512^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a runtime error caused by invalid memory address or nil pointer derefernce by adding compression correctness checks. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39452[MB-39452^]
| *Summary*: The index service now sets a more contextual user-agent in HTTP requests to the cluster manager(ns_server).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39420[MB-39420^]
| *Summary*: Fixed the index service to re-generate protobuf files (.pb.go) files when .proto files are updated.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39114[MB-39114^]
| *Summary*: During index definition operations, the cluster info cache is updated multiple times. In a cluster with large number of buckets, refreshing the cluster info cache took a long time and slowed down these operations. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38988[MB-38988^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a rare race condition that caused the index service to be stuck in the warmup state. This has been fixed by increasing the default size of the feed's backch.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38864[MB-38864^]
| *Summary*: During bulk inserts of heavy workloads, index sync was observed to take a long time. This has been addressed by optimizing indexing of incremental workloads for insert heavy scenarios.

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_v660-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38929[MB-38929^]
| *Summary*: The Index Advisor now supports virtual keyspace for DELETE, MERGE, and UPDATE statements.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31105[MB-31105^]
| *Summary*: The Query service now supports explicit connections to IPv4 or IPv6 or both for extexternal communications for both HTTP and TLSUnique listeners. And the Query service will fail to start if it cannot listen on all required ports.

Note that when using IPv6 on Windows platform, this can cause a considerable degradation in throughput due to an https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40243[underlying issue in Golang].
