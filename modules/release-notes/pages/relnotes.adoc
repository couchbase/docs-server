| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-9982[MB-9982^]
| *Summary*: XDCR should be incremental on topology changes.

XDCR checkpointing is now entirely persistent through topology-changes on the source cluster.
This provides improved performance when failover and rebalance occur on the source cluster.
