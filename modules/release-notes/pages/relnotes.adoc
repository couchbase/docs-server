= Release Notes for Couchbase Server 6.0

Couchbase Server 6.0 is an important release that adds the Analytics service to the Couchbase Data Platform.
It also includes enhancements to the Eventing and Search services.

Take a look at xref:introduction:whats-new.adoc[What's New?] for a list of new features and improvements that are available in this release.

[#release-600]
== Release 6.0

Couchbase Server 6.0 was released in October 2018.

[#changes-in-behavior-600]
=== Major Behavior Changes

There are a few significant changes to the production-ready version of the Analytics service.
You'll find this information handy if you've used the Analytics service in any of the Developer Preview versions of Couchbase Server.

* Bucket association is now automatic
+
The Developer Preview versions required you to explicitly associate the Couchbase Server buckets and Analytics buckets.
For example:
+
----
CREATE BUCKET ha WITH {"name":"health"}
----
+
The Analytics service buckets now automatically mirror Couchbase Server buckets and no special configuration is required to be able to create a dataset on a bucket.

* Dataset definitions no longer require the SHADOW keyword
+
The early Developer Preview releases (earlier than Couchbase Server 5.5) required the SHADOW keyword.
+
The Analytics service (Developer Preview version) was integrated with Couchbase Server during release 5.5 and the SHADOW keyword was made optional.
+
Starting with this release, using the SHADOW keyword is no longer allowed, and using it will return an error.
+
----
CREATE DATASET ((dataverse_name.)? dataset_name)? ON bucket_name (WHERE where_exp)?.
----

* `CONNECT/DISCONNECT BUCKET` have been replaced by `CONNECT/DISCONNECT LINK`
+
The `CONNECT` and `DISCONNECT` commands would activate or deactivate the dataset processing of data from Couchbase Server buckets.
+
You can now use the following syntax to connect all datasets in a dataverse:
+
----
CONNECT LINK (dataverse_name.)? Local (, (dataverse_name.)? Local)*
----

[#known-issues-600]
=== Known Issues

==== Administration/Cluster Management

[#table_knownissues_v600-cluster,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23074[MB-23074^]
| *Summary*: Performance issues may be observed when running Couchbase Server on CentOS 7.3 with kernel 3.10.0-514.6.
|===

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30637[MB-30637^]
| *Summary: Backup and restore for the Analytics service artifacts using the cbbackupmgr utility is currently not supported. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30007[MB-30007^]
| *Summary*: It is possible for a CONNECT BUCKET statement to fail temporarily with the error message "The vbucket belongs to another server(0x7)" when rebalancing Data nodes.

*Workaround*: Retry the operation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29724[MB-29724^]
| *Summary*: Currently, the Analytics service supports index creation only when a shadow dataset has no open connections.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28544[MB-28544^]
| *Summary*: The UNION ALL operation does not work for all query types. For example, a query of the form shown below is not parsed correctly.

----
(SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
                  UNION ALL
                  (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
----

*Workaround*: Remove the parentheses around the first subquery block.

----
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
                      UNION ALL
                      (SELECT ...
                      FROM ...
                      WHERE ...)
----

==== Data Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31410[MB-31410^]
| *Summary*: If bucket memory usage exceeds the high watermark and reaches 99% of the bucket quota, a race condition in KV-Engine DCP consumer is exposed. This may result in DCP messages being processed out-of-order.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: If the memcached process crashes while indexes are being rebalanced, the memcached process can fail to be brought online and the rebalance can get stuck. Manually stopping rebalance will bring the memcached process online.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809^]
| *Summary*: The `last_modified` attribute can be incorrect if a bucket was upgraded and contains old documents.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30772[MB-30772^]
| *Summary*: Killing an Eventing process externally may result in a loss of timers that have been dequeued but not run to completion.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29360[MB-29360^]
| *Summary*: When Sync Gateway is deployed against a bucket, a single document update can be seen over DCP as multiple mutations, some modifying body and others modifying XATTRs. The Eventing service invokes OnUpdate for each such mutation as it does not distinguish at the DCP level if an update modified the body of a document, the XATTRs, or both.

*Workaround*: When both Eventing service and Sync Gateway are deployed against the same bucket, you must ensure that the Eventing code written is idempotent.
|===

==== Full-Text Search Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-fts,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31660[MB-31660^]
| *Summary*: The Search index file deletions take longer time than expected especially when the index is very large and is in a building-up phase while deleting.
This delays the expected freeing up of the actual disk space right after an index deletion. No file leaks have been observed yet.

*Workaround*: If you wait long enough, all the index files will get cleaned up eventually.
Hence in a tight disk space situation, you should be careful of this fact while performing subsequent index deletions and creations. With enough disk space configured, everything ought to work without much perceivable problems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31405[MB-31405^]
| *Summary*: This problem becomes a concern when the system is under heavy DGM (Disk Greater than Memory) condition. In such cases, the Search service ends up having too many files in the
system and due to concurrent file compactions, the overall indexing and querying becomes very slow.

*Workaround*: While there is no proper workaround for this issue, lowering the FTS memory quota (< 10GB) seems to help maintain a reasonably high average indexing throughput.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27429[MB-27429^]
| *Summary*: Scorch indexes were found to contain duplicate pindexes.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31039[MB-31039^]
| *Summary*: A disk usage spike is observed during the initial index build. The disk usage comes down once the log cleaner catches up.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30011[MB-30011^]
| *Summary*: The rebalance progress (in percentage) during a GSI swap rebalance does not always increase linearly. Note that this issue does not persist and the percentage displayed returns to normal quickly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-19869[MB-19869^]
| *Summary*: Rebalance fails when taking out failed over nodes running views, in certain circumstances.
|===

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_knownissues_v600-install,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31393[MB-31393^]
| *Summary*: In some instances, the Windows Uninstaller can leave behind registry entries and subsequently block upgrades on these machines.

*Workaround*: Remove the registry entries manually before installing newer versions of Couchbase Server.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-17571[MB-17571^]
| *Summary*: On an undersized node, the default memory quota assigned to all the selected services by the server might result in a failure.

*Workaround*: Manually adjust the memory allocations appropriately.
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29391[MB-29391^], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29393[MB-29393^]
| *Summary*:  Large numeric values are reported incorrectly.
For example, the modulo operation or a scan for min int64 value returns an incorrect result in case of int64.
|===

==== Security

[#table_knownissues_v600-security,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31558[MB-31558^]
| *Summary*: All requests originating from the UI are currently authenticated using token based authentication, even when client certificate authentication is enabled on the Server and a client certificate is configured in the browser.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26421[MB-26421^]
| *Summary*: The Security > Users tab in the UI does not list the default "administrator" user.Â

==== Tools, Web Console (UI), and REST API

[#table_knownissues_v600-tools-ui-rest-api,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31680[MB-31680^]
| *Summary*: Unable to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console (UI) using Internet Explorer 11 or Edge browsers.

[#fixed-issues-600]
=== Fixed Issues

The notable fixes in this release are listed below. See the Couchbase https://issues.couchbase.com/issues/?filter=16883[issue tracker^] for the complete list of enhancements and fixes in this release.

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v600-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31619[MB-31619^]
| *Summary*: The Memcached logs always use Z (UTC) for timezone when logging instead of the current system timezone offset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31495[MB-31495^]
| *Summary*: Fetching a random key from the Data service may hang if the bucket contains zero documents.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31481[MB-31481^]
| *Summary*: The data service engine may not send STREAM_END message to consumers if non-infinity end sequence number and cursor dropping occurs.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31175[MB-31175^]
| *Summary*: Ephemeral buckets can have tombstones purged before the configured metadata purge interval.

Ephemeral buckets can prematurely purge (discard) tombstones when under high memory and op/s load. As a consequence, DCP consumers fed by KV-Engine (such as replication, secondary indexing, views) may have tombstones not sent to them, meaning their dataset diverges from the Data Service - documents are not deleted from the DCP consumer.

==== Full-Text Search Service

[#table_closedissues_v600-fts,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30498[MB-30498^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where documents were missing from the Scorch index but were intact in an upside_down index.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28847[MB-28847^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the memory usage during search index build was found to overshoot the RAM quota.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27429[MB-27429^]
| *Summary*: Scorch indexes were found to contain duplicate pindexes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25714[MB-25714^]
| *Summary*: On Windows platform, a very high memory/CPU usage was observed when search service was indexing using the fts index. This issue is not seen with the new default 'Scorch' index.
|===

[#table_fixedissues_v600-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31315[MB-31315^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the index service threw an error if an index was dropped when index mutation was ongoing.
