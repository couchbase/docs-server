[#known-issues-720]
== Known Issues

This release contains the following known issues.

=== Couchbase CLI

[#table-known-issues-720-couchbasecli, cols="25,66"]
|===
|Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56321[MB-56321^]
| *Summary:* 7.1.0 couchbase-cli may authenticate using either a username or password, or a mTLS (client certificate).
The CLI argument validation does not handle the case where no authentication is required. For example, node-init.
This results in a false positive where couchbase-cli requires authentication flags to be provided.

*Workaround:* Before a node is initialized, use placeholders for the username and password.
After the node is initialized, a username and password must be supplied.

=== Index Service

[#table-known-issues-720-indexservice, cols="25,66"]
|===
|Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56429[MB-56429^]
| *Summary:* When initial indexing is optimized for Out of Sequence Order [OSO] backfilling, when collections contain only a small fraction of the total number of documents in the bucket, the initial index build is slow in other collections, particularly where the entire bucket is in one collection.

*Workaround:* Update the OSO setting to disable OSO in Indexing.

|===

////

=== Search Service

[#table-known-issues-720-searchservice, cols="25,66"]
|===
|Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-56226[MB-56226^]
| *Summary:* Intermittent crashes and errors happen on Full Text Search at query time in term dictionary and postings list.
This happens when attempting to access invalid addresses or out-of-bounds data.
For example, when term dictionary might be an empty byte slice.

*Workaround:* For the errors, a retry logic on the application layer might help.
However, there is no workaround for the intermittent crashes which Couchbase are investigating.
