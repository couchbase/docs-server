| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28778[MB-28778]
| The default number of Data Service worker threads has been increased; from 3/4 of the number of available CPU threads, to 7/8 of the number of available CPU threads (minimum of 4 in both cases).
This makes better use of the available CPU resource, particularly on larger systems, as such users may see an increase in CPU utilization on such systems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27173[MB-27173]
| Prior to 5.5, the [.cmd]`mctimings` command defined the _request start_ as the time when the 24 byte request header had been read by the Data Service.
However, many requests contain a _body_ which also needs to be read before a request can be processed.
As such, the reported duration didn't accurately reflect how long the server actually spent processing a request, if it was still waiting for the body to be received from the network.

In 5.5, the definition of _request start_ has been changed to be when the header _and_ body have both been read.
This has the effect of more accurately reflecting the time spent by the Data Service in servicing a request, as the time the body spends in transit over the network is no longer included.
As a result command timings for affected request will have shorter durations compared to how they were measured before 5.5.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27060[MB-27060]
| The Couchbase Server 5.5 Windows installer package no longer bundles the DLL [.path]_dbghelp.dll_ which is required by Breakpad to produce dumps on Windows platforms.
Starting version 5.5, Breakpad will pick the DLL (dbghelp.dll) that is shipped with the OS.
