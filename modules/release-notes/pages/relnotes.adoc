[#changes-in-behavior-650]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

==== Backup and Restore

===== Compression

In the previous versions of Couchbase Server, value compression always occurred on the backup client. 

Starting with version 6.5, `cbbackupmgr` will leverage Server compression and backup the documents as compressed whenever possible. If the data is compressed by default, it will be backed up as compressed. If the data is not compressed, it will be compressed first and then backed up when value compression is opted. This improves the performance by reducing the size of the dataset to backup for transmission on the pipe and for the backup itself.
