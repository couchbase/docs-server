= Release Notes for Couchbase Server 6.5

Couchbase Server 6.5 brings many sought-after relational capabilities to the NoSQL world.
This release seeks to improve developer agility, reduce total cost of ownership, enhance manageability, and provide more enterprise-grade security and performance. 

Take a look at xref:introduction:whats-new.adoc[What's New?] for a list of new features and improvements in this release.

[#release-650]
== Release 6.5.0

Couchbase Server 6.5 was released in January 2020.

[#changes-in-behavior-650]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

==== Backup and Restore

===== Compression

In the previous versions of Couchbase Server, value compression always occurred on the backup client. 

Starting with version 6.5, `cbbackupmgr` will leverage Server compression and back up the documents as compressed whenever possible.
If the data is compressed by default, it will be backed up as compressed.
If the data is not compressed, it will be compressed first and then backed up when value compression is opted. This improves the performance by reducing the size of the data set to back up for transmission on the pipe and for the backup itself.

==== Eventing Service

* The internal class `N1qlQuery()` has been removed and replaced with internal class `N1QL()`, and the latter is not syntactically backwards compatible with former.

==== Networking

This release introduces the following networking changes:

* The Search Service now uses port 9130 / 19130 for node-to-node traffic.
** The Search Service also no longer uses an encrypted port unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.
+
In Couchbase Server 6.0 Enterprise Edition, the Search Service explicitly required encrypted port 18094 for xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/search-service.adoc[scatter-gather] operations between nodes running the Search Service (even if you were still using unencrypted port 8094 for client-to-node traffic).
Starting in Couchbase Server 6.5, the Search Service uses gRPC over port 9130 / 19130 for all node-to-node traffic, and no longer uses an encrypted port for intra-cluster communication unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.

* The 21100-21299 range of cluster and data management ports is no longer required.
Instead, the following ports are now required for cluster management:
** 21100 / 21150: Node-to-node communication
** 21200 / 21250: Node-local communication
** 21300 / 21350: Node-local communication

For more information about required network ports, refer to xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements].

==== VIEW Indexes

Starting with this release, the use of VIEW indexes is deprecated in N1QL only.
Node-to-node encryption is unsupported for the use of VIEW indexes in N1QL only.

[#known-issues-650]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v650-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36461[MB-36461^]
| *Summary:* In cases where the input to IN subclause with EVERY quantifier is MISSING or NULL, Analytics and Query engines differ in behavior. The Analytics service treats MISSING or NULL input values(in this case) as equivalent to an empty array, which results in the whole `EVERY … IN …` expression returning TRUE, while the Query service returns MISSING if the input is MISSING (or NULL if the input is NULL).

*Workaround:* Use the IS KNOWN predicate to test whether the IN value is not NULL/MISSING.

`WHERE (x IS KNOWN) AND (EVERY y IN x SATISFIES ... END)`

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_knownissues_v650-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| *Summary*: When a synchronous durability request is made unrelated operations pipelined on the same socket may be serviced with higher latency, due to https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-10291[MB-10291].

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32437[MB-32437^]
| *Summary*: In a multi-bucket scenario approaching the new 30 bucket limit, the Eventing service supports only one function per bucket. An error will be thrown when deploying the second function on a given bucket. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31639[MB-31639^]
| *Summary*: The `cbbackupmgr` utility fails to backup a cluster with Eventing service for a user with "Data Backup & Restore" role.

[#fixed-issues-650]
=== Fixed Issues

This section highlights some of the issues fixed in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36750[MB-36750^]
| *Summary:* The following values for the format parameter of the Analytics Service API are being deprecated in this release and will be removed in a future release: application/x-adm, application/json, application/json;lossless, text/csv.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36702[MB-36702^]
| *Summary:* Fixed an issue where an analytics query threw an internal error when using `to_string()` to try to force optimizer to use an index.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36455[MB-36455^]
| *Summary:* Fixed an issue where the analytics query returned different results (extra 'null' value) when indexnl hint was applied to left outer join.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v650-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33764[MB-33764^]
| *Summary*: In release 6.0.2 and above, only users with "security-admin" role assigned will be allowed to POST an HTTP request to the /controller/uploadClusterCA and /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoints. In the previous releases, the user had to have "cluster-admin" role assigned in order to POST an HTTP request to /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoint. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30920[MB-30920^]
| *Summary*: Couchbase Server exposes '/diag/eval' endpoint which by default is available on TCP/8091 and/or TCP/18091. Authenticated users that have 'Full Admin' role assigned can send arbitrary Erlang code to 'diag/eval' endpoint of the API. The code will be subsequently executed in the underlying operating system with privileges of the user which was used to start Couchbase.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: If the memcached process crashed while indexes were being rebalanced, the memcached process could be failed to be brought online and the rebalance got stuck. This has been fixed and rebalance is now interrupted by memcached failure.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30553[MB-30553^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where requesting the hash statistic severely affects the response times of replicateTo requests.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32244[MB-32244^]
| *Summary*: When dealing with non-existent keys, the `get` operation will now return undefined if the key doesn’t exist and the `delete` operation will now be treated as a no-op if the key doesn’t exist. Prior to version 6.5 both operations ( `get` or `delete`) threw exceptions when applied against non-existent keys. Note, the "_language compatibility_" setting in the Function Settings dialog allows for backward compatibility to maintaining prior behavior.
|===

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v650-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33478[MB-33478^]
| *Summary*: Any kind of collatejson crash caused a downtime, particularly on the mutation path. This has been fixed to recover only from collatejson crashes. After recovering, the docid is logged and the mutation key is skipped, and every such recovered-skip docid is logged as an error on the console. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30207[MB-30207^]
| *Summary*: Fixed SUM aggregate query for large integers.
|===
