[#new-features-651]
=== New Features

==== Support for Polygon in Geospatial Search Queries 

The areas within which geospatial search queries return matches can now be specified as polygons, in addition to circles and rectangles. Each polygon is expressed as a series of latitude-longitude coordinates, each determining the location of one corner of the polygon. For details, see xref:fts:fts-geospatial-queries.adoc[Geospatial Queries].

[#improvements-651]
=== Other Improvements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33240[MB-33240^]: Configure filtered events in audit logs using `couchbase-cli`. See xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-audit.adoc[setting-audit] for details.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35633[MB-35633^]: Use N1QL to set document expiration. 
*  https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37321[MB-37321^]: New _file append mode_ in `cbq` to append redirected output to the end of an existing file, rather than overwriting the existing file. See xref:tools:cbq-shell.adoc[cbq: The Command Line Shell for N1QL] for details.

[#fixed-issues-651]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37811[MB-37811^]
| *Summary:* Fixed an issue where the Analytics node failed to rebalance in after an IP reassignment. This issue was observed in a Kubernetes environment. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37458[MB-37458^]
| *Summary:* On Azure, an Analytics cluster with more than one node failed during cluster configuration as the second node was unable to join the cluster. The issue was caused by resolving the name of each node on the node itself, instead of resolving the names to addresses on the caller side. The best-practices document instructs users to assign the public DNS node name to localhost in the hosts file, causing the callers to erroneously attempt to contact nodes on their own loopback interface. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37358[MB-37358^]
| *Summary:* The analytics service no longer makes all assigned quota available to the JVM as heap. The service reserves some amount of this quota for JVM overhead, to help prevent the system from becoming unstable due to low memory.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v651-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37420[MB-37420^]
| *Summary*: Starting with this release, Couchbase Server supports node-to-node encryption with wildcard certs in SAN entries.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32401[MB-32401^]
| *Summary*: Couchbase Server responded with a WWW-Authenticate header to unauthenticated requests which allowed a user to authenticate via a user / password dialog in a web browser. The problem is that these credentials are cached by the browser which allows a hacker to use CSRF to attack a cluster in the event that an administrator has used their browser to check the results of a REST API request.

This has been fixed by providing an option to disable this behavior using `couchbase-cli` (`couchbase-cli setting-security -set -disable-www-authenticate 1 -c localhost:8091 -u <user> -p <password>`). Note that this is not disabled by default. See `couchbase-cli` xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] for details.
|===

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_fixedissues_v651-install-upgrade,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38390[MB-38390^]
| *Summary*: It was impossible to directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.0 if any cluster contained deleted documents. This was caused by DCP Deletion V2 packets being sent regardless of whether the DELETE_TIMES feature was negotiated. 

This has been fixed and you can directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.1. See xref:install:upgrade.adoc#supported-upgrade-paths[Supported Upgrade Paths] for details.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38145[MB-38145^]
| *Summary*:  Fixed an issue where N1QL generated from Eventing used only indexes that were present at the time of deployment. This issue was only observed with Couchbase Server versions 6.0.3 (build 2895) and 6.5.0 (build 4960).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32437[MB-32437^], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38033[MB-38033^]
| *Summary*: In a multi-bucket scenario approaching the new 30 bucket limit, the Eventing service supports only one function per bucket. An error will be thrown when deploying the second function on a given bucket. 
|===

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v651-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38029[MB-38029^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where an index that was both partitioned and partial was not updated correctly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25982[MB-25982^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where compaction of large vBuckets caused a significant increase in memory usage.
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38303[MB-38303^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Scorch file merger leaked index snapshot refCounts on index closure.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38142[MB-38142^]
| *Summary*: An exception in the third-party dependency "RoaringBitmap/roaring" caused a runtime exception  (index out of range) in the Search service. This has been fixed by upgrading the roaring SHA to release v0.4.19 which contains the fix.
|===

==== Tools, Web Console (UI), and REST API

[#table_fixedissues_v651-tools-ui-rest-api,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37498[MB-37498^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the cluster name information was lost in settings when adding an index node to the cluster.
|===

[#deprecation-651]
=== Deprecated Features

* Memcached buckets are deprecated in this release. We recommend using Ephemeral buckets as an alternative.
* Use of 'top-keys', which returns a JSON object containing information on the most frequently used keys within a bucket, is deprecated. Top-keys provides data for the display on each per-bucket Statistics screen in Couchbase Web Console.

[#release-650]

[#changes-in-behavior-650]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

==== Backup and Restore

===== Compression

In the previous versions of Couchbase Server, value compression always occurred on the backup client. 

Starting with version 6.5, `cbbackupmgr` will leverage Server compression and back up the documents as compressed whenever possible.
If the data is compressed by default, it will be backed up as compressed.
If the data is not compressed, it will be compressed first and then backed up when value compression is opted. This improves the performance by reducing the size of the data set to back up for transmission on the pipe and for the backup itself.

==== Eventing Service

* The internal class `N1qlQuery()` has been removed and replaced with internal class `N1QL()`, and the latter is not syntactically backwards compatible with former.

==== Networking

This release introduces the following networking changes:

* The Search Service now uses port 9130 / 19130 for node-to-node traffic.
** The Search Service also no longer uses an encrypted port unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.
+
In Couchbase Server 6.0 Enterprise Edition, the Search Service explicitly required encrypted port 18094 for xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/search-service.adoc[scatter-gather] operations between nodes running the Search Service (even if you were still using unencrypted port 8094 for client-to-node traffic).
Starting in Couchbase Server 6.5, the Search Service uses gRPC over port 9130 / 19130 for all node-to-node traffic, and no longer uses an encrypted port for intra-cluster communication unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.

* The 21100-21299 range of cluster and data management ports is no longer required.
Instead, the following ports are now required for cluster management:
** 21100 / 21150: Node-to-node communication
** 21200 / 21250: Node-local communication
** 21300 / 21350: Node-local communication

For more information about required network ports, refer to xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements].

==== VIEW Indexes

Starting with this release, the use of VIEW indexes is deprecated in N1QL only.
Node-to-node encryption is unsupported for the use of VIEW indexes in N1QL only.

==== Features Now Available in Couchbase Server Community Edition

Starting with this release, the following features have been made available in the Community Edition of Couchbase Server:

* Built-in Schema Browser (INFER)
* CBIMPORT/CBEXPORT
* Graphical Explain Plan
* Schema display auto-complete in the query editor

[#supported-platforms-650]

[#known-issues-650]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v650-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36461[MB-36461^]
| *Summary:* In cases where the input to IN subclause with EVERY quantifier is MISSING or NULL, Analytics and Query engines differ in behavior. The Analytics service treats MISSING or NULL input values(in this case) as equivalent to an empty array, which results in the whole `EVERY … IN …` expression returning TRUE, while the Query service returns MISSING if the input is MISSING (or NULL if the input is NULL).

*Workaround:* Use the IS KNOWN predicate to test whether the IN value is not NULL/MISSING.

`WHERE (x IS KNOWN) AND (EVERY y IN x SATISFIES ... END)`

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32528[MB-32528^]
| *Summary*: When a synchronous durability request is made unrelated operations pipelined on the same socket may be serviced with higher latency, due to https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-10291[MB-10291].

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25982[MB-25982^]
| *Summary*: Compaction of large vbuckets causes a significant increase in memory usage.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v650-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38145[MB-38145^]
| *Summary*:  N1QL generated from Eventing uses only indexes that were present at the time of deployment. Ensure all indexes necessary for queries utilized by the function have been created prior to deploying the function. This issue is only observed with Couchbase Server versions 6.0.3 (build 2895) and 6.5.0 (build 4960).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37042[MB-37042^]
| *Summary*: The CLI and REST tools for exporting and importing Eventing functions do not support cross compatible syntax when using only the command line, however the UI can import either syntax.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32437[MB-32437^]
| *Summary*: In a multi-bucket scenario approaching the new 30 bucket limit, the Eventing service supports only one function per bucket. An error will be thrown when deploying the second function on a given bucket. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31639[MB-31639^]
| *Summary*: The `cbbackupmgr` utility fails to backup a cluster with Eventing service for a user with "Data Backup & Restore" role.

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31039[MB-31039^]
| *Summary*: A disk usage spike is observed during the initial index build. The disk usage comes down once the log cleaner catches up.
|===

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_knownissues_v650-install-upgrade,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38390[MB-38390^]
| *Summary*: It is impossible to directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.0 if any cluster contains deleted documents. 
This is because DCP Deletion V2 packets are sent regardless of whether the DELETE_TIMES feature is negotiated.

*Workaround*: Upgrade to an intermediate version, such as Couchbase Server 6.0.4+, before upgrading to 6.5.0.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37269[MB-37269^]
| *Summary*: Upgrading from version 6.0.4 to version 6.5.0 using offline upgrade or rolling online upgrade using graceful failover and delta node does not work. Version 6.0.4 included a per-node configuration migration and it was released after 6.5.0 which doesn't recognize the migration.

*Workaround*: To upgrade successfully from version 6.0.4 to 6.5.0, you must use swap rebalance. This will be fixed in the next maintenance release on the 6.5.x series.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33522[MB-33522^]
| *Summary*: The `cbupgrade` script fails to upgrade single node IPv6 clusters.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38046[MB-38046^]
| *Summary*: When performing an online upgrade from Couchbase Server 6.0.3 to Couchbase Server 6.5, some active Couchbase SDK 2.x applications may give an exception `4040: No such prepared statement`.

*Workaround:* Refer to xref:install:upgrade-strategy-for-features.adoc#prepared-statements[Prepared Statement Upgrades].

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37768[MB-37768^]
| *Summary*: On macOS (and OS-X) the `cbc` binary needs @rpath to be manually set on the `cbc` binary, this will allow proper execution of `cbc` (and related symlinked command line tools).

[#fixed-issues-650]
=== Fixed Issues

This section highlights some of the issues fixed in this release. 

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36750[MB-36750^]
| *Summary:* The following values for the format parameter of the Analytics Service API are being deprecated in this release and will be removed in a future release: application/x-adm, application/json, application/json;lossless, text/csv.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36702[MB-36702^]
| *Summary:* Fixed an issue where an analytics query threw an internal error when using `to_string()` to try to force optimizer to use an index.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36455[MB-36455^]

|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v650-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33764[MB-33764^]
| *Summary*: In release 6.0.2 and above, only users with "security-admin" role assigned will be allowed to POST an HTTP request to the /controller/uploadClusterCA and /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoints. In the previous releases, the user had to have "cluster-admin" role assigned in order to POST an HTTP request to /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoint. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30920[MB-30920^]
| *Summary*: Couchbase Server exposes '/diag/eval' endpoint which by default is available on TCP/8091 and/or TCP/18091. Authenticated users that have 'Full Admin' role assigned can send arbitrary Erlang code to 'diag/eval' endpoint of the API. The code will be subsequently executed in the underlying operating system with privileges of the user which was used to start Couchbase.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: If the memcached process crashed while indexes were being rebalanced, the memcached process could be failed to be brought online and the rebalance got stuck. This has been fixed and rebalance is now interrupted by memcached failure.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30553[MB-30553^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where requesting the hash statistic severely affects the response times of replicateTo requests.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v650-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32244[MB-32244^]
| *Summary*: When dealing with non-existent keys, the `get` operation will now return undefined if the key doesn’t exist and the `delete` operation will now be treated as a no-op if the key doesn’t exist. Prior to version 6.5 both operations ( `get` or `delete`) threw exceptions when applied against non-existent keys. Note, the "_language compatibility_" setting in the Function Settings dialog allows for backward compatibility to maintaining prior behavior.
|===

==== Index Service and Views

[#table_fixedissues_v650-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33478[MB-33478^]
| *Summary*: Any kind of collatejson crash caused a downtime, particularly on the mutation path. This has been fixed to recover only from collatejson crashes. After recovering, the docid is logged and the mutation key is skipped, and every such recovered-skip docid is logged as an error on the console. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30207[MB-30207^]
| *Summary*: Fixed SUM aggregate query for large integers.
