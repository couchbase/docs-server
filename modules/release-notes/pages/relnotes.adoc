[#fixed-issues-603]
=== Fixed Issues

The notable fixes in this release are listed below.

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v603-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36177[MB-36177^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue so that data files are recreated on ALL keep nodes when failing over datasets and not just the intersection of keep nodes and nodes where the datasets were previously located.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36177[MB-35940^]
| *Summary*: Added the ability to filter datasets based on document keys and not just fields.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35688[MB-35688^]
| *Summary*: A cancelled rebalance-in left an Analytics cluster without any metadata replicas. Upon attempt to failover and remove the remaining node, the cluster became permanently unusable unless you removed all Analytics nodes from the cluster and re-added the service, which resulted in an uninitialized Analytics cluster.
This has been fixed so that metadata replica addition is not skipped on a cancelled rebalance-in. 


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34798[MB-34798^]
| *Summary*: During node startup, the system latest checkpoint files are read to determine the system state and complete the startup based on that state. If all the checkpoint files found were corrupted, then the node was bootstrapped as a new node and as a result, all data was deleted. This has been fixed to distinguish between a real bootstrap scenario (where there are no checkpoint files) and a scenario where the checkpoint files could not be read successfully, and in the latter case, force recovery from the start of the available transaction logs. 
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v603-ns_server,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35748[MB-35748^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a race condition around trap_exit.
|===

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_v603-xdcr,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35807[MB-35807^]
| *Summary*: XDCR has been enhanced to be aware of target nodes' setups and only restart pipelines if the target and remote cluster reference are both set up for mixed mode encryption, and the target node's mode really changed. 

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34298[MB-34298^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue so that the topology change detector does not delete the replication spec when a target bucket is not found.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v603-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36101[MB-36101^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where DeleteWithMetadata against an XATTR document could result in a mutation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36087[MB-36087^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue when DeleteWithMeta against a value evicted XATTR document crashed kv-engine.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35702[MB-35702^]
| *Summary*: SSL write failures may not reset the connection in the write phase. This has been fixed by propagating SSL write errors from sendmsg.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35195[MB-35195^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the audit config reload was stuck due to the drive (or path) being unavailable.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34879[MB-34879^]
| *Summary*: An error was thrown when performing a GET on a document that is both compressed and has extended attributes(XATTRs) if the client supported compression and the uncompressed document is sent to the client with the compressed flag still set. This has been fixed.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_fixedissues_v603-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35734[MB-35734^]
| *Summary*: In rebalance_service_manager, the default value of the `isBalanced` flag is set to false. If the index service restarts after rebalance is complete, this flag will be set to false and the rebalance button is activated assuming that the index service requires a rebalance. This is not expected behaviour. This has been fixed by setting the default value of `isBalanced` to true.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35700[MB-35700^]
| *Summary*: The collatejson package's JoinArray has been optimized to mitigate high memory usage.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35477[MB-35477^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a rare issue where the Plasma storage log grew indefinitely.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35473[MB-35473^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue that caused a Write Bucket Failure and corrupted the vBucket file.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35323[MB-35323^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue in ForestDB where renaming a compacted file led to the file getting deleted.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34428[MB-34428^]
| *Summary*: When querying on a ddoc that is deleted, the views query incorrectly returned HTTP error code 500 suggesting an internal sever error. This has been fixed and the views query now returns an error message suggesting that the ddoc has been deleted.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34158[MB-34158^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a memory allocation failure in Forestdb that caused a system crash under pressure.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32341[MB-32341^]
| *Summary*: Added the ability to trace operations on a file.
|===

==== Query Service

[#table_fixedissues_v603-query,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35811[MB-35811^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a connection pool leak observed when querying system:indexes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35670[MB-35670^]
| *Summary*: When scanning through all n1ql nodes to perform a distributed command, the query engine memory grew until it crashed. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35516[MB-35516^]
| *Summary*: COUNT on an index FullScan returned incorrect results when it included DESC order. This has been fixed by updating the code to handle Inclusion getting flipped due to the DESC order.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-35392[MB-35392^]
| *Summary*: The query service returned incorrect results as the implict covering of ANY predicate did not handle any part that was not covered. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34750[MB-34750^], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34665[MB-34665^]
| *Summary*: Avoid IntersectScan when the index is a subset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34698[MB-34698^]
| *Summary*: Improved performance for count aggregate on full index scan by using CountTotal.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34667[MB-34667^]
| *Summary*: Better identifier handling to determine whether an identifier should be covered or not.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34660[MB-34660^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the implicit cover of nested array did not work as expected with arbitrary variables.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34616[MB-34616^]
| *Summary*: When schema inferencing is run, document field names are no longer included in the log file.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34544[MB-34544^]

[#fixed-issues-602]
=== Fixed Issues

The notable fixes in this release are listed below.

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v602-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33696[MB-33696^]
| *Summary*: The analytics service on one node failed to startup repeatedly due to a failure while performing a rollback and threw an exception. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33595[MB-33595^]
| *Summary*: Variables bound by a QuantifiedExpression were incorrectly included when computing free variables for that expression. This has been fixed and these variables will now be excluded from the free variable set.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33564[MB-33564^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the predicate in the WHERE clause was incorrectly pushed through the running aggregate operator (AT subclause), which then lead to wrong results.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33338[MB-33338^]
| *Summary*: It was observed that a rebalance in of new analytics nodes hangs indefinitely on a firewall misconfiguration where newly added nodes were unable to contact the CC. This has been fixed so that rebalance fails if the Keep-Nodes do not join within a reasonable timeframe (2 minutes).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33025[MB-33025^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the analytics HTTP server incorrectly assumed that all request payloads are UTF-8 encoded. The analytics HTTP responses are encoded using system-default encoding and the service will now attempt to honor any requested encodings (Accept-Charset), or default to UTF-8.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33016[MB-33016^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an internal compiler error caused by index selection when the search expression was not constant.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32777[MB-32777^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where array functions, most notably the array_intersect() function, caused an out of memory exception due to object creations, especially for large datasets.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32775[MB-32775^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue to catch all unexpected exceptions on network threads and close the connection in such cases to avoid attempting to process the message causing the exception forever.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32745[MB-32745^]
| *Summary*: The analytics service now uses the Couchbase temp directory, which is set to `/var/lib/couchbase/tmp` by default, and no longer requires access to the operating system's temp directory.
|===

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_v602-xdcr,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33970[MB-33970^]
| *Summary*: By default, XDCR will prevent replications from being created on a source ephemeral bucket with NRU policy. This specific release of Couchbase Server includes a special XDCR internal settings flag, `AllowSourceNRUCreation`, that allows replications to be created on a source ephemeral bucket with NRU policy.

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:9998/xdcr/internalSettings -d AllowSourceNRUCreation="true"
----

WARNING: Changing the internal replication setting will cause all XDCR processes to restart. This causes temporary disruption as all existing replications will have to restart.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33671[MB-33671^]
| *Summary*: Following an issue on a remote cluster, XDCR failed to recover and threw an exception.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33582[MB-33582^]
| *Summary*: After upgrading to 6.0.x, it was observed that the compression type field in the UI was not populated automatically. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32814[MB-32814^]
| *Summary*: Fixed REST endpoint error handling for settings errors and nil value types.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v602-ns_server,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33750[MB-33750^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a race condition that was exposed when a supervisor that is shutting down normally, is for some reason brutally shutdown leaving an orphan child process. This rogue lease acquirer interfered with the operation of the orchestrator causing, for instance, rebalance to fail.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33321[MB-33321^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue to prevent map corruption due to a change in `num_replicas` after an interrupted rebalance operation.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v602-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34507[MB-34507^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where documents with a TTL, containing system XATTRs, and which are compressed, may have their datatype metadata incorrectly set. This prevents any subsequent modification of the XATTRs on the deleted document, until the document is re-created.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34262[MB-34262^]
| *Summary*: Follow-on to MB-33919. Fixed issue where erroneous tombstone delete times could get used when performing a DCP backfill on ephemeral buckets.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34173[MB-34173^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where recovery failed due to invalid snapshot start (or end) on disk.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33919[MB-33919^]
| *Summary*: The tombstone `delete-time` could be in the future or in the far past, causing the tombstone to be purged immediately or to remain on the disk for potentially long time. This has been fixed and the tombstone `delete-time` is now set to `ep_real_time` at the point of deletion.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33918[MB-33918^]
| *Summary*: Fixed excessive triggering cursor dropping issue which caused Couchbase Server to attempt to recover more memory than required.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33906[MB-33906^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the response to a getReplica command could be significantly delayed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33854[MB-33854^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the KV-Engine may incorrectly return ENGINE NOT_STORED to the client after trying to perform arithmetic operations if another client concurrently modified the same key.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33773[MB-33773^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the KV-Engine may crash due to a race between DCP Consumer message processing and stream shutdown.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33351[MB-33351^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the breakpad did not catch the memcached segfault.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32840[MB-32840^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the audit daemon asserted when rotating an empty audit log causing a crash.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32687[MB-32687^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where signalling a connection could result in deadlock.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32685[MB-32685^]
| *Summary*: Introduced a delay in updating the RBAC database revision number to avoid returning AUTH_STALE during a refresh of the RBAC database.


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-15009[MB-15009^]
| *Summary*: Improve the effectiveness of the active defragmenter to also defragment Document metadata (StoredValue objects) in addition to document values. This should reduce memory fragmentation for workloads which have multiple document metadata sizes (i.e. a range of key lengths).
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v602-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33085[MB-33085^]
| *Summary*: The cbevent tool provides a way to recover the eventing service when eventing specific metakv contents and metadata bucket contents were corrupted or lost. This tool clears all the Functions (deployed and undeployed) and restores Eventing service to a clean state. To use the tool, run the following command:
`$ cbevent -<host> -<username> -<password> -flush`
|===

==== Full-Text Search Service

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34164[MB-34164^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the index node crashed with too many open files.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34003[MB-34003^]
| *Summary*: Index created failed as the index service was unable to create index replicas. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33945[MB-33945^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Views engine returns a server error when bucket data is compressed and doc is not used in the view definition.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33666[MB-33666^]
| *Summary*: It was possible to create an index with fewer replicas than the default num_replicas if you used nodes_list in the WITH clause with fewer nodes than the default number of replicas.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33654[MB-33654^]

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32932[MB-32932^]
| *Summary*: For non-partitioned indexes, the planner did not always use all the indexer nodes in cluster for planning. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32824[MB-32824^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the index planner could end up assigning the same instance id to lost replicas when more than 1 replica was lost.

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32466[MB-32466^]
| *Summary*: Index creation on meta fields is not allowed and trying to do so will result in an error.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32455[MB-32455^]

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32435[MB-32435^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where a rebalance operation could fail due to the reuse of dataset IDs internally.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32079[MB-32079^]
| *Summary*: When a dataverse was dropped, bucket listeners were not unregistered. Consequently, when the dataverse was re-created, the CONNECT LINK statement failed as it picked up the old bucket listeners. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32073[MB-32073^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the AnalyticsReader role, a read-only role, was incorrectly able to change the metadata and drop dataverses.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31814[MB-31814^]
| *Summary*: Starting this release, the OpenJDK version 11 is bundled with the service. See xref:install:install-environments.adoc[Additional Requirements] for details.

==== Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[#table_fixedissues_v601-xdcr,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32299[MB-32299^]
| *Summary*: XDCR failed to replicate files larger than the network usage limit. This has been fixed so the bandwidth throttler can handle large documents with sizes greater than the usage limit.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32221[MB-32221^]
| *Summary*: Uncompressed replication from 6.0 nodes to 5.0 nodes failed due to partial information being returned from the parts. This has been fixed to enable accurate detection of compression error code.

| *Summary*: Sub-document API single-path mutation ignored expiry if doc_flags included extras.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32181[MB-32181^]
| *Summary*: If one or more Ephemeral buckets were present, then nonIO background tasks could be incorrectly scheduled, potentially resulting in DCP connection instability (premature disconnection). This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32136[MB-32136^]
| *Summary*: When data corruption is detected on a data service node, relevant information that can help troubleshoot is now being logged.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32135[MB-32135^]
| *Summary*: In some cases, the memory allocation failures were not handled causing "Write Commit Failure" errors or corruption in vBucket files.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32078[MB-32078^]
| *Summary*: If an append/prepend request contended with another request at the Server, instead of automatically retrying on the Server (as expected), it returned EEXISTs back to the application.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31968[MB-31968^]
| *Summary*: Audit logging has been updated to capture the user name when documents are created, updated, or deleted from the web console.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31967[MB-31967^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the datatype field when using the DCP_OPEN flags incorrectly reflected the contents of the body payload and not the original datatype.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31410[MB-31410^]
| *Summary*: If bucket memory usage exceeded the high watermark and reached 99% of the bucket quota, a race condition in KV-Engine DCP consumer was exposed. This could result in DCP messages being processed out-of-order.

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v601-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31924[MB-31924^]
| *Summary*: Reduced excessive logging by Eventing service when the debugger is turned on.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31923[MB-31923^]
| *Summary*: Following the failover of a vBucket, the Eventing service restarted streams with seqno from the latest failover log entry instead of using the entry where seqnoInFailoverLog <= lastProcessedSeqno. This resulted in missed events.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31922[MB-31922^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where some events were missing after a source bucket flush operation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32239[MB-32239^]
| *Summary*: The DCP noop interval has been lowered to 20sec to improve the chances of the projector receiving the noop message early and thus avoiding frequent roll backs.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32228[MB-32228^]
| *Summary*: During warmup, one of the indexes with low number of items triggered an issue and caused the internal garbage collector to run forever. Thus causing the entire index service to stall during warmup. This issue was observed when using Plasma storage engine.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31989[MB-31989^]
| *Summary*: Improved the DCP rollback handling mechanism. Instead of ignoring the disk snapshots before rolling back, the index service will now exhaust trying DCP stream requests with all the disk snapshots before rolling back to 0.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31744[MB-31744^]
| *Summary*: An error is seen during a SUM aggregate pushdown when the entry value is greater than MaxInt64.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32306[MB-32306^]
| *Summary*: Index creation using the IN clause did not work as expected. This has been fixed.

However, when using the IN clause, ensure that your queries use the same IN terms in the same order as in the index.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32301[MB-32301^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue so that when an on connection error is encountered, certain operations are retried before returning an error.

[#release-600]
== Release 6.0

Couchbase Server 6.0 was released in October 2018.

[#changes-in-behavior-600]
=== Major Behavior Changes

There are a few significant changes to the production-ready version of the Analytics service.
You'll find this information handy if you've used the Analytics service in any of the Developer Preview versions of Couchbase Server.

* Bucket association is now automatic
+
The Developer Preview versions required you to explicitly associate the Couchbase Server buckets and Analytics buckets.
For example:
+
----
CREATE BUCKET ha WITH {"name":"health"}
----
+
The Analytics service buckets now automatically mirror Couchbase Server buckets and no special configuration is required to be able to create a dataset on a bucket.

* Dataset definitions no longer require the SHADOW keyword
+
The early Developer Preview releases (earlier than Couchbase Server 5.5) required the SHADOW keyword.
+
The Analytics service (Developer Preview version) was integrated with Couchbase Server during release 5.5 and the SHADOW keyword was made optional.
+
Starting with this release, using the SHADOW keyword is no longer allowed, and using it will return an error.
+
----
CREATE DATASET ((dataverse_name.)? dataset_name)? ON bucket_name (WHERE where_exp)?.
----

* `CONNECT/DISCONNECT BUCKET` have been replaced by `CONNECT/DISCONNECT LINK`
+
The `CONNECT` and `DISCONNECT` commands would activate or deactivate the dataset processing of data from Couchbase Server buckets.
+
You can now use the following syntax to connect all datasets in a dataverse:
+
----
CONNECT LINK (dataverse_name.)? Local (, (dataverse_name.)? Local)*
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Analytics data from Developer Preview releases cannot be upgraded.

If you plan to use the production release of Couchbase Analytics in version 6.0, you must perform a fresh installation of Couchbase Server 6.0 on any existing Analytics nodes that are running a previous version; otherwise, the Analytics Service will not function properly.

When upgrading from Couchbase Server 5.5 to Couchbase Server 6.0 or later, any existing Analytics datasets must be removed before the upgrade and recreated afterwards, and data must be ingested again from the Data Service.

==== Administration/Cluster Management

[#table_knownissues_v600-cluster,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23074[MB-23074^]
| *Summary*: Performance issues may be observed when running Couchbase Server on CentOS 7.3 with kernel 3.10.0-514.6.
|===

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30637[MB-30637^]
| *Summary:* Backup and restore for the Analytics service artifacts using the `cbbackupmgr` utility is currently not supported.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30007[MB-30007^]
| *Summary*: It is possible for a CONNECT BUCKET statement to fail temporarily with the error message "The vbucket belongs to another server(0x7)" when rebalancing Data nodes.

*Workaround*: Retry the operation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29724[MB-29724^]
| *Summary*: Currently, the Analytics service supports index creation only when a dataset is disconnected.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-28544[MB-28544^]
| *Summary*: The UNION ALL operation does not work for all query types. For example, a query of the form shown below is not parsed correctly.

----
(SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
                  UNION ALL
                  (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...)
----

*Workaround*: Remove the parentheses around the first subquery block.

----
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
                      UNION ALL
                      (SELECT ...
                      FROM ...
                      WHERE ...)

==== Data Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31410[MB-31410^]
| *Summary*: If bucket memory usage exceeds the high watermark and reaches 99% of the bucket quota, a race condition in KV-Engine DCP consumer is exposed. This may result in DCP messages being processed out-of-order.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30074[MB-30074^]
| *Summary*: If the memcached process crashes while indexes are being rebalanced, the memcached process can fail to be brought online and the rebalance can get stuck. Manually stopping rebalance will bring the memcached process online.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29809[MB-29809^]
| *Summary*: The `last_modified` attribute can be incorrect if a bucket was upgraded and contains old documents.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30772[MB-30772^]
| *Summary*: Killing an Eventing process externally may result in a loss of timers that have been dequeued but not run to completion.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29360[MB-29360^]
| *Summary*: When Sync Gateway is deployed against a bucket, a single document update can be seen over DCP as multiple mutations, some modifying body and others modifying XATTRs. The Eventing service invokes OnUpdate for each such mutation as it does not distinguish at the DCP level if an update modified the body of a document, the XATTRs, or both.

*Workaround*: When both Eventing service and Sync Gateway are deployed against the same bucket, you must ensure that the Eventing code written is idempotent.

==== Full-Text Search Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-fts,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31660[MB-31660^]
| *Summary*: The Search index file deletions take longer time than expected especially when the index is very large and is in a building-up phase while deleting.
This delays the expected freeing up of the actual disk space right after an index deletion. No file leaks have been observed yet.

*Workaround*: If you wait long enough, all the index files will get cleaned up eventually.
Hence in a tight disk space situation, you should be careful of this fact while performing subsequent index deletions and creations. With enough disk space configured, everything ought to work without much perceivable problems.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31405[MB-31405^]
| *Summary*: This problem becomes a concern when the system is under heavy DGM (Disk Greater than Memory) condition. In such cases, the Search service ends up having too many files in the
system and due to concurrent file compactions, the overall indexing and querying becomes very slow.

*Workaround*: While there is no proper workaround for this issue, lowering the FTS memory quota (< 10GB) seems to help maintain a reasonably high average indexing throughput.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27429[MB-27429^]
| *Summary*: Scorch indexes were found to contain duplicate pindexes.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_knownissues_v600-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31039[MB-31039^]
| *Summary*: A disk usage spike is observed during the initial index build. The disk usage comes down once the log cleaner catches up.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30011[MB-30011^]
| *Summary*: The rebalance progress (in percentage) during a GSI swap rebalance does not always increase linearly. Note that this issue does not persist and the percentage displayed returns to normal quickly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-19869[MB-19869^]
| *Summary*: Rebalance fails when taking out failed over nodes running views, in certain circumstances.

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_knownissues_v600-install,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31393[MB-31393^]
| *Summary*: In some instances, the Windows Uninstaller can leave behind registry entries and subsequently block upgrades on these machines.

*Workaround*: Remove the registry entries manually before installing newer versions of Couchbase Server.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-17571[MB-17571^]
| *Summary*: On an undersized node, the default memory quota assigned to all the selected services by the server might result in a failure.

*Workaround*: Manually adjust the memory allocations appropriately.
|===

| *Summary*:  Large numeric values are reported incorrectly.
For example, the modulo operation or a scan for min int64 value returns an incorrect result in case of int64.

[#fixed-issues-600]
=== Fixed Issues

The notable fixes in this release are listed below. See the Couchbase https://issues.couchbase.com/issues/?filter=16883[issue tracker^] for the complete list of enhancements and fixes in this release.

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v600-kv-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31619[MB-31619^]
| *Summary*: The Memcached logs always use Z (UTC) for timezone when logging instead of the current system timezone offset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31495[MB-31495^]
| *Summary*: Fetching a random key from the Data service may hang if the bucket contains zero documents.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31481[MB-31481^]
| *Summary*: The data service engine may not send STREAM_END message to consumers if non-infinity end sequence number and cursor dropping occurs. This could cause clients such as cbbackupmgr to hang indefinitely.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31175[MB-31175^]
| *Summary*: Ephemeral buckets can have tombstones purged before the configured metadata purge interval.

Ephemeral buckets can prematurely purge (discard) tombstones when under high memory and op/s load. As a consequence, DCP consumers fed by KV-Engine (such as replication, secondary indexing, views) may have tombstones not sent to them, meaning their dataset diverges from the Data Service - documents are not deleted from the DCP consumer.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30920[MB-30920^]
| Authenticated users with full administrative privileges were able to access the diagnostic endpoint, `/diag/eval` remotely, allowing these users to run arbitrary code on the server host. This issue is addressed by only allowing full administrators to access this endpoint from localhost. This mitigates the issue as users that have access to the server host are already in a position to run arbitrary code.

Note that the `diag/eval` endpoint is authenticated and requires the highest privileges in the system (Full Admin). It is the case that a user with access to this endpoint can already delete, corrupt or coy all the data in the system. Customers can mitigate this issue by tightly controlling access to full administrative privileges.
