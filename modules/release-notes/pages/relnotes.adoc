[#release-652]
== Release 6.5.2 (February 2021)

Couchbase Server 6.5.2, released in February 2021, is the second maintenance release in the 6.5.x series for Couchbase Server. This release includes important bug fixes in various components.

[#fixed-issues-652]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v652-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44220[MB-44220^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the Analytics driver went into a restart loop when a filesystem corruption was encountered, resulting in the Analytics service exiting with an error.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44215[MB-44215^]
| *Summary*: The validity bit was used to determine corrupted merged components.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-44214[MB-44214^]
| *Summary*: When making the debug log async, the DCP client log level was incorrectly set to ERROR. Fixed this issue to use the global service log level instead, which defaults to DEBUG.
|===

==== Data Service

[#table_fixedissues_v652-data,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42918[MB-42918^]
| *Summary*: If a durable write is performed via INSERT (Add), an existing item may be removed from the hash table if it was deleted and not yet persisted. Another client performing a GET could trigger a fetch of the item from disk, and the returned item could be the logical predecessor of the unpersisted DELETE that was removed from the hash table if it had not yet been persisted. This means that the client would not be able to read their own write. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42610[MB-42610^]
| *Summary*: If a replica vBucket was promoted to active having only received a partial backfill (a data loss scenario), then a subsequent expiration of an item could expire a pending durable write if it had the same CAS. This caused any future lookups or writes to that key to cause memcached to crash. This issue has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-42607[MB-42607^]
| *Summary*: During TLS handshake with the Data Service, if the node certificate required more than 8192 bytes to transmit, then the handshake failed. This has been fixed.

// Add MB-41942 when ticket is public

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41868[MB-41868^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where histograms implemented with HDRHistogram stopped reporting when the total samples exceeded 2^31.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41867[MB-41867^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an infinite loop due to HdrHistogram being reset.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41255[MB-41255^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the replication of deletes with XATTRS failed if the affected document was non-resident.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41407[MB-41407^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a potential crash during eviction for Ephemeral bucket with nruEviction configured. The crash was a result of a race condition leading to heap use after free. This is a rare condition and has only been seen during data race analysis.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-41300[MB-41300^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a potential issue where sanity checks may trigger at Replica and cause a crash when the node receives temporary mutations for Sync Replication.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40543[MB-40543^]
| *Summary*: Added the ability to re-enable FTS logging in memcached for debug purposes.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-40531[MB-40531^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a performance regression where the HiFi-MRU Item Pager (added in 5.0) would evict more active items compared to previous LRU ItemPager under certain workloads.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38283[MB-38283^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where Memcached log wrapped due to excessive DCP "no memory" messages.
|===

==== Index Service

[#table_fixedissues_v652-gsi-views,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43921[MB-43921^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where the listReplicaCount operation timed out causing a failure during index creation.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43517[MB-43517^]
| *Summary*: The index service now sets a more contextual user-agent in HTTP requests to the cluster manager(ns_server).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43232[MB-43232^]
| *Summary*: Starting with version 6.5.0, VbSeqnosReader has been updated to process two types of requests: VbSeqnosRequest and VbMinSeqnosRequest. When processing VbSeqnosRequest, if there are any VbMinSeqnosRequest’s, then the VbMinSeqnosRequest’s will be queued back into the requestCh of VbSeqnosReader. However, if the VbSeqnosReader closed by this time, then enqueue would fail and the caller would be waiting for a response indefinitely. This has been fixed to respond to outstanding requests upon exit of VbSeqnosReader.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43132[MB-43132^]
| *Summary*: During index definition operations, the cluster info cache is updated multiple times. In a cluster with large number of buckets, refreshing the cluster info cache took a long time and slowed down these operations. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43072[MB-43072^]
| *Summary*: Fixed an issue where a delay in the connectBucket function seemed to cause the indexer to projector connection time out.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43047[MB-43047^]
| *Summary*: Increased the size of the change notification channel in leader to avoid possible deadlock in removeListener in gometa leader.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43046[MB-43046^]
| *Summary*: The projector went into a stream termination loop when trying to stream a near 20 MB document due to redundant doc size checks in projector. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43041[MB-43041^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a runtime error caused by invalid memory address or nil pointer derefernce by adding compression correctness checks.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-43039[MB-43039^]
| *Summary*: Fixed a memory growth issue observed when processing many metadata operations.

[#release-651]
== Release 6.5.1 (April 2020)

Couchbase Server 6.5.1, released in April 2020, is the first maintenance release in the 6.5.x series for Couchbase Server. This release adds support for bounded polygons in geospatial search queries in addition to improvements in Query service and tools components. It also includes important bug fixes in various components.

_Quick Links_: <<new-features-651>> | <<improvements-651>> | <<fixed-issues-651>> | <<deprecation-651>>

[#new-features-651]
=== New Features

==== Support for Polygon in Geospatial Search Queries

The areas within which geospatial search queries return matches can now be specified as polygons, in addition to circles and rectangles. Each polygon is expressed as a series of latitude-longitude coordinates, each determining the location of one corner of the polygon. For details, see xref:fts:fts-geospatial-queries.adoc[Geospatial Queries].

[#improvements-651]
=== Other Improvements

* Configure filtered events in audit logs using `couchbase-cli`. See xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-audit.adoc[setting-audit] for details.
* Built-in support to manage document expiration using N1QL. See N1QL DML statement documentation for details - xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/insert.adoc[INSERT] | xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/upsert.adoc[UPSERT] | xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/update.adoc[UPDATE] | xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/merge.adoc[MERGE].
* Standardized non-root install and upgrade for rpm packages which enables you to easily install, upgrade, and maintain Couchbase Server as a non-root user.
** *Install*: A new installer https://packages.couchbase.com/cb-non-package-installer/cb-non-package-installer[`cb-non-package-installer`] is used to install Couchbase Server instead of using `rpm2cpio` and `reloc.sh`. See xref:install:rhel-suse-install-intro.adoc#perform-non-sudonon-root-installation[Performing Non-Root/Non-Sudo Installation] for details.
** *Status*: Introduced a new command `couchbase-server --status` that enables you to check the status of the server.
** *Upgrade*: The https://packages.couchbase.com/cb-non-package-installer/cb-non-package-installer[`cb-non-package-installer`] is used to upgrade Couchbase Server from previous versions. All xref:install:upgrade-strategies.adoc[upgrade options], including Rolling Online Upgrade with Graceful Failover and Delta Recovery are supported. See xref:install:rhel-suse-install-intro.adoc#rh-nonroot-nonsudo-upgrade[Upgrading as Non-Root/Non-Sudo] for details.

[#fixed-issues-651]
=== Fixed Issues

==== Analytics Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37811[MB-37811^]
| *Summary:* Fixed an issue where the Analytics node failed to rebalance in after an IP reassignment. This issue was observed in a Kubernetes environment.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37458[MB-37458^]
| *Summary:* On Azure, an Analytics cluster with more than one node failed during cluster configuration as the second node was unable to join the cluster. The issue was caused by resolving the name of each node on the node itself, instead of resolving the names to addresses on the caller side. The best-practices document instructs users to assign the public DNS node name to localhost in the hosts file, causing the callers to erroneously attempt to contact nodes on their own loopback interface. This has been fixed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37358[MB-37358^]
| *Summary:* The analytics service no longer makes all assigned quota available to the JVM as heap. The service reserves some amount of this quota for JVM overhead, to help prevent the system from becoming unstable due to low memory.
|===

==== Cluster Manager

[#table_fixedissues_v651-cluster-manager,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37420[MB-37420^]
| *Summary*: Starting with this release, Couchbase Server supports node-to-node encryption with wildcard certs in SAN entries.
|===

==== Eventing Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-eventing,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38145[MB-38145^]
| *Summary*:  Fixed an issue where N1QL generated from Eventing used only indexes that were present at the time of deployment. This issue was only observed with Couchbase Server versions 6.0.3 (build 2895) and 6.5.0 (build 4960).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32437[MB-32437^], https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38033[MB-38033^]
| *Summary*: In a multi-bucket scenario approaching the new 30 bucket limit, the Eventing service supports only one function per bucket. An error will be thrown when deploying the second function on a given bucket.
|===

==== Install and Upgrade

[#table_fixedissues_v651-install-upgrade,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38390[MB-38390^]
| *Summary*: It was impossible to directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.0 if any cluster contained deleted documents. This was caused by DCP Deletion V2 packets being sent regardless of whether the DELETE_TIMES feature was negotiated.

This has been fixed and you can directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.1. See xref:install:upgrade.adoc#supported-upgrade-paths[Supported Upgrade Paths] for details.

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37231[MB-37231^]
| *Summary*: New _file append mode_ in `cbq` to append redirected output to the end of an existing file, rather than overwriting the existing file. See xref:tools:cbq-shell.adoc[cbq: The Command Line Shell for N1QL] for details.
|===

==== Search Service

[#table_fixedissues_v651-search,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38303[MB-38303^]

[#changes-in-behavior-650]
=== Major Changes in Behavior from Previous Releases

This section notes major changes in behavior from previous releases.

==== Backup and Restore

===== Compression

In the previous versions of Couchbase Server, value compression always occurred on the backup client.

Starting with version 6.5, `cbbackupmgr` will leverage Server compression and back up the documents as compressed whenever possible.
If the data is compressed by default, it will be backed up as compressed.
If the data is not compressed, it will be compressed first and then backed up when value compression is opted. This improves the performance by reducing the size of the data set to back up for transmission on the pipe and for the backup itself.

==== Eventing Service

* The internal class `N1qlQuery()` has been removed and replaced with internal class `N1QL()`, and the latter is not syntactically backwards compatible with former.

==== Networking

This release introduces the following networking changes:

* The Search Service now uses port 9130 / 19130 for node-to-node traffic.
** The Search Service also no longer uses an encrypted port unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.
+
In Couchbase Server 6.0 Enterprise Edition, the Search Service explicitly required encrypted port 18094 for xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/search-service.adoc[scatter-gather] operations between nodes running the Search Service (even if you were still using unencrypted port 8094 for client-to-node traffic).
Starting in Couchbase Server 6.5, the Search Service uses gRPC over port 9130 / 19130 for all node-to-node traffic, and no longer uses an encrypted port for intra-cluster communication unless xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[node-to-node encryption] is enabled.

* The 21100-21299 range of cluster and data management ports is no longer required.
Instead, the following ports are now required for cluster management:
** 21100 / 21150: Node-to-node communication
** 21200 / 21250: Node-local communication
** 21300 / 21350: Node-local communication

For more information about required network ports, refer to xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements].

==== View Indexes

The use of view indexes is deprecated in N1QL only and will be removed in a future release.
Node-to-node encryption is unsupported for the use of view indexes in N1QL only.

==== Features Now Available in Couchbase Server Community Edition

Starting with this release, the following features have been made available in the Community Edition of Couchbase Server:

* Built-in Schema Browser (INFER)
* CBIMPORT/CBEXPORT
* Graphical Explain Plan
* Schema display auto-complete in the query editor

[#supported-platforms-650]
=== New Supported Platforms

This release adds support for the following platforms:

* CentOS 8
* Debian 10
* macOS 10.14 "Mojave" (Development only)
* Oracle Linux 8
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
* Microsoft Windows Server 2019

See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms.

[#deprecation-650]
=== Deprecated Features and Platforms

==== Deprecated Features

The following functionality is deprecated or is unsupported.

* The following values for the format parameter of the Analytics Service API are being deprecated in this release and will be removed in a future release: `application/x-adm`, `application/json`, `application/json;lossless`, `text/csv`.

* Starting this release, the Analytics Service has deprecated the use of OpenJDK 8.

[#known-issues-650]
=== Known Issues

This section highlights some of the known issues in this release.

==== Analytics Service

[#table_knownissues_v650-analytics,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36461[MB-36461^]
| *Summary:* In cases where the input to IN subclause with EVERY quantifier is MISSING or NULL, Analytics and Query engines differ in behavior. The Analytics service treats MISSING or NULL input values(in this case) as equivalent to an empty array, which results in the whole `EVERY … IN …` expression returning TRUE, while the Query service returns MISSING if the input is MISSING (or NULL if the input is NULL).

*Workaround:* Use the IS KNOWN predicate to test whether the IN value is not NULL/MISSING.

`WHERE (x IS KNOWN) AND (EVERY y IN x SATISFIES ... END)`

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38145[MB-38145^]
| *Summary*:  N1QL generated from Eventing uses only indexes that were present at the time of deployment. Ensure all indexes necessary for queries utilized by the function have been created prior to deploying the function. This issue is only observed with Couchbase Server versions 6.0.3 (build 2895) and 6.5.0 (build 4960).

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37042[MB-37042^]
| *Summary*: The CLI and REST tools for exporting and importing Eventing functions do not support cross compatible syntax when using only the command line, however the UI can import either syntax.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32437[MB-32437^]
| *Summary*: In a multi-bucket scenario approaching the new 30 bucket limit, the Eventing service supports only one function per bucket. An error will be thrown when deploying the second function on a given bucket.

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38390[MB-38390^]
| *Summary*: It is impossible to directly upgrade Couchbase Server from versions prior to 5.5.0 to version 6.5.0 if any cluster contains deleted documents.
This is because DCP Deletion V2 packets are sent regardless of whether the DELETE_TIMES feature is negotiated.

*Workaround*: Upgrade to an intermediate version, such as Couchbase Server 6.0.4+, before upgrading to 6.5.0.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37269[MB-37269^]
| *Summary*: Upgrading from version 6.0.4 to version 6.5.0 using offline upgrade or rolling online upgrade using graceful failover and delta node does not work. Version 6.0.4 included a per-node configuration migration and it was released after 6.5.0 which doesn't recognize the migration.

*Workaround*: To upgrade successfully from version 6.0.4 to 6.5.0, you must use swap rebalance. This will be fixed in the next maintenance release on the 6.5.x series.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33522[MB-33522^]
| *Summary*: The `cbupgrade` script fails to upgrade single node IPv6 clusters.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38046[MB-38046^]
| *Summary*: When performing an online upgrade from Couchbase Server 6.0.3 to Couchbase Server 6.5, some active Couchbase SDK 2.x applications may give an exception `4040: No such prepared statement`.

*Workaround:* Refer to xref:install:upgrade-strategy-for-features.adoc#prepared-statements[Prepared Statement Upgrades].

|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-33764[MB-33764^]
| *Summary*: In release 6.0.2 and above, only users with "security-admin" role assigned will be allowed to POST an HTTP request to the /controller/uploadClusterCA and /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoints. In the previous releases, the user had to have "cluster-admin" role assigned in order to POST an HTTP request to /node/controller/reloadCertificate endpoint.

| *Summary*: Couchbase Server exposes '/diag/eval' endpoint which by default is available on TCP/8091 and/or TCP/18091. Authenticated users that have 'Full Admin' role assigned can send arbitrary Erlang code to 'diag/eval' endpoint of the API. The code will be subsequently executed in the underlying operating system with privileges of the user which was used to start Couchbase.

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32244[MB-32244^]
| *Summary*: When dealing with non-existent keys, the `get` operation will now return undefined if the key doesn’t exist and the `delete` operation will now be treated as a no-op if the key doesn’t exist. Prior to version 6.5 both operations ( `get` or `delete`) threw exceptions when applied against non-existent keys. Note, the "_language compatibility_" setting in the Function Settings dialog allows for backward compatibility to maintaining prior behavior.
