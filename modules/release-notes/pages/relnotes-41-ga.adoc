| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20105[MB-20105]
| `Purge Seqno` would be reset in case there was a compaction call that was not purging any items, causing tombstone items not to be purged.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20102[MB-20102]
| `Purge Seqno `is incorrectly passed to the compactor for development design documents preventing Couchbase Server from reclaiming the disk space.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20047[MB-20047]
| When using `cbdocloader` and loading files from disk, the documents are loaded except for the design documents, which are silently skipped.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19802[MB-19802]
| When XDCR `getMeta` receives an error that is not a network timeout type, it repairs network connection and continues in a loop to read from the client until a timeout occurs after 2 minutes.
In this window, XDCR replication appears stuck.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19757[MB-19757]

http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19608[MB-19608]

This behavior can, for example, result in a node failover caused by the lack of response to statistics calls.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18452[MB-18452]
| If a DCP consumer is hit with more data than it can consume, it will run the Processor task for as long as this situation continues resulting in NON-IO threads being held and preventing other NON-IO tasks from running.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16766[MB-16766]
| The Cluster manager continuously crashes on an undersized system

| XDCR replication can stop working when nodes are rebalanced out of the target cluster.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18651[MB-18651]
| Indexer service can pick up a wrong index file after being restarted during compaction, causing the index to have partial data.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18476[MB-18476]
| Data Service (memcached) on windows can crash when failing to write to disk.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18251[MB-18251]

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18133[MB-18133]
| XDCR upgrade process can fail when upgrading from pre-4.X Couchbase Server versions when a remote cluster is unreachable.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18018[MB-18018]
| Improvement: New private setting to block TLS version 1.1 and lower for SSL.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17815[MB-17815]
| Data service (memcached) can count operations twice when the bucket is using full eviction mode, and the operation has to go to disk.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17758[MB-17758]
| XDCR does not recover in some cases when there is a network partition between target and source clusters.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17517[MB-17517]
 The Data service (memcached) will crash when arithmetic operations operate on an invalid CAS.
 CAS operation will incorrect work when a CAS mismatch should have been generated.
| When an invalid CAS is discovered, one of the following situations can occur:



An invalid CAS can only be created when the cluster has been upgraded from Couchbase Server 2.X, and the locks operations have been used.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17506[MB-17506]
| Improvement: New private setting is needed that allows disabling the cluster map being included in a Not My VBucket response from the server to the client.
The above situation might in some cases reduce network bandwidth between clients and the cluster during a rebalance.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17481[MB-17481]
| XDCR uses more network bandwidth than expected due to stats collection.

| Query Service Count(*) with USE KEYS returned the incorrect results.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17088[MB-17088]
| Data service (memcached): Stats can be incorrect because of an integer underflow.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17024[MB-17024]
| Improvement: Data Service (memcached) has better logging around bucket deletion .

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17009[MB-17009]
| Index service’s initial Global Secondary Index builds could hang with larger data sets.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16949[MB-16949]
| Data service (memcached): A small memory leak was caused by DCP backfill manager.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16915[MB-16915]
| Data service (memcached) crash caused by a race condition when a DCP producer is closed while a backfill task is running.
This can happen when rebalancing is terminated or when XDCR connections are terminated.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16910[MB-16910]
| `Memcached.log` can contain an unexpectedly large number of "warmup is complete" messages after the warmup.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16836[MB-16836]
| Data service (memcached) [.cmd]`cbstats reset` command does not reset `ep_bg_fetched` stat.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16656[MB-16656]
| Rebalancing can fail when replica indexes are enabled on Views as the Data service is returning the incorrect high sequence number to the View engine.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16632[MB-16632]
| Improvement: Reduced lock contention inside the Data service in some cases by reducing CRUD operation latency.

*Known issues*

The following table lists the known issues in the 4.1 release:

[#table_n1b_rv1_2t1,cols="20,91"]
|===
| *Issue*
| *Description*

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17004[MB-17004]
| *Summary*: When using queries backed by GSI to perform singleton lookups and range scans, occasional processing of index compaction can incur long pauses affecting concurrent query throughput.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16939[MB-16939]
| *Summary*: Prepared encoded plan for N1QL statements with system catalog queries in WHERE clause may not be recognized.

*Workaround*: To avoid this issue, do not execute certain queries with prepared statements (known as `.adhoc(false)` or similar in SDK APIs).
Instead, use regular queries with system catalog queries.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16935[MB-16935]
| *Summary*: Kernel futex wait call can cause ForestDB to hang during initial index build.

*Workaround*: If you are running RHEL 6x or CentOS 6.x, we highly recommend upgrading to the latest kernel (2.6.32-504.16.2 or higher).
With Centos 7.1, you should upgrade to Linux kernel 3.18 at least.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16902[MB-16902]
| *Summary*: Latency on queries using the [.param]`request_plus` option on scan consistency may be abnormally high during index compaction, leading to application timeouts of queries.
The response times may occasionally be in the 10s of seconds or the query may return an error due to timeout.
The default timeout interval is 75 seconds.

*Workaround*:

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16831[MB-16831]
| *Summary*: When creating a global secondary index (GSI), the interactive query shell [.api]`cbq`, can timeout if the result is not returned within 2 minutes.
Although the index is successfully created, the error message is unclear.

*Workaround*:Create the index with [.param]`defer_build:true`, and then build the index separately.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16618[MB-16618]
| *Summary*: View queries with reduce and group set to true, and parameterized by a list of keys that are not in ascending order, can produce results that are not properly reduced.

*Workaround*: Ensure that the list of keys passed to the query is in ascending order.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16115[MB-16115]
| *Summary*: When the indexer settings are changed, the connections from the query shell [.cmd]`cbq` can sometimes become stale causing an EOF errors.

*Workaround*: Restart the query engine before executing the query again.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-15968[MB-15968]
| *Summary*: Replication over SSL encryption from a source 4.0 cluster to a destination 2.5.x cluster may result in slow performance (rate of data transfer).

*Workaround*: We recommend upgrading the destination cluster to 3.x version.
