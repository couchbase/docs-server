| Issue | Description

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20312[MB-20312]
| Key value engine task will run at HIGH or LOW, but not guaranteed at the requested priority.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20236[MB-20236]
| Indexer process uses large amounts of CPU and RAM when no indexes are configured.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20182[MB-20182]
| When upgrading from 2.5.x to 4.x.x, TAP followed by DCP can result in a failure.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20153[MB-20153]

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20105[MB-20105]
| `Purge Seqno` would be reset in case there was a compaction call that was not purging any items, causing tombstone items not to be purged.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20102[MB-20102]
| `Purge Seqno `is incorrectly passed to the compactor for development design documents preventing Couchbase Server from reclaiming the disk space.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-20047[MB-20047]
| When using `cbdocloader` and loading files from disk, the documents are loaded except for the design documents, which are silently skipped.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19843[MB-19843]
| The View engine fails with DCP start sequence number that is greater than end sequence number error and fails to roll back.
This behavior can cause view engine indexing issues.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19802[MB-19802]
| When XDCR `getMeta` receives an error that is not a network timeout type, it repairs network connection and continues in a loop to read from the client until a timeout occurs after 2 minutes.
In this window, XDCR replication appears stuck.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19757[MB-19757]

http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19608[MB-19608]

TLS configuration on the port 11208 is lost on server restart.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19714[MB-19714]
| After lots of document UPSERT operations, high CPU utilization remains for nodes with GSI indexes for an indefinite time even if there are no more UPSERT operations.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-19697[MB-19697]
| More than one XDCR replication instance might start after replication is resumed, resulting in incorrect functional behavior and performance impact.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18453[MB-18453]
| When a high-priority task is busy, tasks of lower priorities never have a chance to run and have been observed waiting for many hours.
This behavior can, for example, result in a node failover caused by the lack of response to statistics calls.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-18452[MB-18452]
| If a DCP consumer is hit with more data than it can consume, it will run the Processor task for as long as this situation continues resulting in NON-IO threads being held and preventing other NON-IO tasks from running.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16766[MB-16766]
| The Cluster manager continuously crashes on an undersized system

*Known issues in 4.1.2*

The following are the known issues:

[cols="20,81"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16831[MB-16831]
| *Summary:* When creating a Global Secondary Index (GSI), the interactive query shell `cbq` can time out if the result is not returned within 2 minutes.
Although the index is successfully created, the error message is unclear.

*Workaround:*Create the index with `defer_build:true` and then build the index separately.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16618[MB-16618]
| *Summary:* When the View queries with the options `reduce` and `group` set to `true` are parameterized by a list of keys that are not listed in ascending order, the produced results might not be properly reduced.

*Workaround:* Ensure that the list of keys passed to the query is in ascending order.

== Release Notes for 4.1

Couchbase Server 4.1 was released in December 2015.

*Known Issues*

The following table lists the known issues in the 4.1 release:

[#table_n1b_rv1_2t1,cols="20,91"]
|===
| *Issue*
| *Description*

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-17004[MB-17004]
| *Summary*: When using queries backed by GSI to perform singleton lookups and range scans, occasional processing of index compaction can incur long pauses affecting concurrent query throughput.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16939[MB-16939]
| *Summary*: Prepared encoded plan for N1QL statements with system catalog queries in WHERE clause may not be recognized.

*Workaround*: To avoid this issue, do not execute certain queries with prepared statements (known as `.adhoc(false)` or similar in SDK APIs).
Instead, use regular queries with system catalog queries.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16935[MB-16935]
| *Summary*: Kernel futex wait call can cause ForestDB to hang during initial index build.

*Workaround*: If you are running RHEL 6x or CentOS 6.x, we highly recommend upgrading to the latest kernel (2.6.32-504.16.2 or higher).
With Centos 7.1, you should upgrade to Linux kernel 3.18 at least.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16902[MB-16902]
| *Summary*: Latency on queries using the [.param]`request_plus` option on scan consistency may be abnormally high during index compaction, leading to application timeouts of queries.
The response times may occasionally be in the 10s of seconds or the query may return an error due to timeout.
The default timeout interval is 75 seconds.

*Workaround*:

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16831[MB-16831]
| *Summary*: When creating a global secondary index (GSI), the interactive query shell [.api]`cbq`, can timeout if the result is not returned within 2 minutes.
Although the index is successfully created, the error message is unclear.

*Workaround*:Create the index with [.param]`defer_build:true`, and then build the index separately.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16618[MB-16618]
| *Summary*: View queries with reduce and group set to true, and parameterized by a list of keys that are not in ascending order, can produce results that are not properly reduced.

*Workaround*: Ensure that the list of keys passed to the query is in ascending order.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16115[MB-16115]
| *Summary*: When the indexer settings are changed, the connections from the query shell [.cmd]`cbq` can sometimes become stale causing an EOF errors.

*Workaround*: Restart the query engine before executing the query again.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-15968[MB-15968]
| *Summary*: Replication over SSL encryption from a source 4.0 cluster to a destination 2.5.x cluster may result in slow performance (rate of data transfer).

*Workaround*: We recommend upgrading the destination cluster to 3.x version.

| Couchbase Server failed to start on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16421[MB-16421]
| If a getMeta was issued at the destination cluster during XDCR followed by a GET request by the client, the background fetch operation for the item did not complete and caused a large number of disk reads and client side timeouts.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16389[MB-16389]
| When deletion of a large bucket happened in the background, rebalance was disabled, and the status of the ongoing background task was shown in the UI.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16385[MB-16385]
| Querying a view with a reduce function based on a subset of partitions resulted in a massive memory usage.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16357[MB-16357]

| Running the Elasticsearch connector sometimes resulted in high CPU usage.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16159[MB-16159]

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-16013[MB-16013]
| XDCR based on DCP consumed a large amount of RAM with large mutations.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-15876[MB-15876]
| When using XDCR with SSL, replication to an older cluster failed after an online upgrade to 4.0 and an error message that the pipeline failed to start was received.

| http://www.couchbase.com/issues/browse/MB-13948[MB-13948]
| The mapping phase of the view MapReduce operation took a lot of memory if lots of key-value pairs were emitted per document.
