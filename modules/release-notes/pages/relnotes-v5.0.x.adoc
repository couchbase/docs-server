*Fixed Issues*

*Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)*

[#table_fixedissues_xdcr_501,cols="25,66"]

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27162[MB-27162]
| Revision-based conflict resolution did not work as expected as the revision number was not updated for a create that immediately followed a delete operation.
The revision number of a deleted document was updated after the item was added to the checkpoint queue, which meant that when you recreate that document, the revision number was not being replicated intra-cluster or via XDCR.
This has been fixed.

*Security*

[#table_fixedissues_security_501,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27203[MB-27203]
| The "[.param]``default``" bucket is a bucket that in versions prior to 5.0 was either suggested or automatically created for users during the install and configuration process with a goal of being compatible with memcached out of the box.
As its intention was to allow users to quickly get started with Couchbase it permitted anonymous access, consistent with memcached behavior.
Starting 5.0, all buckets require authenticated access.

However, there was a bug in 5.0.0 where under certain circumstances anonymous access could be allowed to the bucket.
This issue only affected a bucket with the name "[.param]``default``" and could only be triggered by an authenticated user with administrative permissions.
This issue has been fixed.

| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26556[MB-26556]
| The [.cmd]`couchbase-cli cluster-init` command failed to initialize all services in the Community Edition as the default storage mode incorrectly pointed to Plasma, which is available in the Enterprise Edition, instead of ForestDB.

[#release-500]
== Release 5.0.0

Couchbase Server 5.0.0 was released in October 2017.
This release includes xref:introduction:whats-new.adoc[new features] and behavior changes.
The following sections list the behavior changes, fixed issues, known issues, and deprecated items.

[#change-behavior]
*Major Behavior Changes Compared to Version 4.6*

Here are the behavior changes in the product, compared to the previous (4.6.x) release.

[#ul_dhx_b15_xz]
* Newly created buckets in 5.0 (including sample buckets) do not have any passwords associated with them.
To access a bucket, a user must be created with appropriate roles to access using RBAC.
See xref:security:security-roles.adoc[Bucket Full Access] for details.
* Important: Many 5.0 features require the latest versions of Couchbase SDK.
It is critical to update the SDK before updating to 5.0.
Upgrade according to the SDK versions listed in the <<sdk-compatibility,SDK Compatibility>> chart below.
* The TAP protocol which was previously deprecated, is now removed.
TAP is an internal protocol that streams information about data changes between cluster nodes.
TAP is replaced with a new protocol called Database Change Protocol (xref:architecture:high-availability-replication-architecture.adoc#concept_hj1_njj_vs[DCP]).
* Starting 5.0, port based buckets can only be created now through the bucket CLI command.
Use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc#couchbaseclibucketcreate1.idm386415259904[bucket-create] command to create a port based bucket.
+
[caption=Remember]
IMPORTANT: Server-side moxi which drives port based bucket creation has been deprecated.
Consider using client-side moxi instead.

* For Windows, [.path]_.exe_ installers which were previously deprecated are now removed and replaced with industry-standard MSI installer files.
Consequently, any upgrade for the Windows platform from pre-5.0 version to 5.0 will need to be done in a rolling upgrade fashion.
See xref:install:upgrade-online.adoc#topic_t2x_k2v_xs[Performing the Rolling Online Upgrade] for details.
* Re-designed xref:admin:ui-intro.adoc#topic1980[Couchbase Web Console].

[#known-issues-limitations]
*Known Issues and Limitations*

The following table lists some of the known issues in this release.

[#table_zgb_11j_qbb,cols="25,66"]
|===
| Issue | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-27203[MB-27203]
| *Summary*: The "[.param]``default``" bucket is a bucket that in versions prior to 5.0 was either suggested or automatically created for users during the install and configuration process with a goal of being compatible with memcached out of the box.
As its intention was to allow users to quickly get started with Couchbase it permitted anonymous access, consistent with memcached behavior.
Starting 5.0, all buckets require authenticated access.
Also in 5.0 there is a bug where under certain circumstances anonymous access can be allowed to the bucket.
This issue only affects a bucket with the name "[.param]``default``" and can only be triggered by an authenticated user with administrative permissions.
This issue will be fixed in the next maintenance release.

*Workaround*: Do not define a bucket named "[.param]``default``" in your cluster configuration.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26171[MB-26171]
| *Summary*: Creating two XDCR replications to the same cluster with different users is not supported.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26126[MB-26126]
| *Summary*: When using Couchbase Server 5.0 with Sync Gateway 1.5+ and the Mobile Convergence feature is enabled in Sync Gateway (enable_shared_bucket_access), the count of non-resident documents reported in the UI may be incorrect.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26085[MB-26085]
| *Summary*: Rebalance failure is observed if the index planner takes a long time ( > ns-server timeout) to execute.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26065[MB-26065]
| *Summary*: Rebalance exits when loading the memcached RBAC file.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26037[MB-26037]
| *Summary*: During a rebalance, if the destination node for a particular vBucket already has a previous, outdated version of that vBucket then the rebalance can initially fail.

*Workaround*: Retry the rebalance; the second attempt should succeed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-26022[MB-26022]
| *Summary*: When a source topology changes, while the docs_processed and changes_left stats are both recomputed, only the changes_left stats in the statistics overview are updated.
This leads to incorrect docs_processed and incorrect, potentially negative changes_left statistics.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25938[MB-25938]
| *Summary*: Potential corruption of documents with extended attributes(XATTRs) during high concurrency.

If a document contains extended attributes (XATTRs) and a Key/Value mutation request changes one of those XATTRs, the previous XATTR values are written to in a non-atomic way.
This means that there is a potential race if another concurrent request was also accessing the same document at the same time.
The other request could read a partial or corrupted value for the document.

Note that this issue is believed to be very rare and has only been seen under synthetic data race analysis.

*Workaround*: Do not modify XATTRs on documents which already have them.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25935[MB-25935]
| *Summary*: Data Service returns TEMP_FAIL for locked keys instead of LOCKED.

Data Service 5.0 adds extended error codes (XERROR) to provide richer error handling between newer, smart SDKs and the server.
As part of this, attempting to mutate a document which is locked should return ERROR_LOCKED, however it incorrectly returns TEMP_FAIL.

*Workaround*: Check for both LOCKED and TEMP_FAIL error codes when using pessimistic locking.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25909[MB-25909]
| *Summary*: When you upgrade the source node in a unidirectional replication from 4.1 to 4.6, the GoGC global setting was set to 0 instead of a higher number.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25785[MB-25785]
| *Summary*: Resuming a backup process on ephemeral buckets fails if there was a data service rollback in the original backup that failed.
This issue is observed when there is a failover shortly after starting the first backup in a backup repository.
removing the original backup.

*Workaround*: Remove the original backup by using the --purge flag and then start the backup process again.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25707[MB-25707]
| *Summary*: UI errors in XDCR are observed even though XDCR continues to function.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23074[MB-23074]
| *Summary*: Performance issues may be observed when running Couchbase Server on CentOS 7.3 with kernel 3.10.0-514.6.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-22679[MB-22679]
| *Summary*: The Full Text Search service doesn't delete pindex files when deleting the index after a MOSS crash.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-21772[MB-21772]
| *Summary*: Full Text Search queries fail under high load on multi-node cluster due to a large number of connections.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-12000[MB-12000]
| *Summary*: The rebalance progress reported during delta recovery is confusing as certain phases like warmup are not tracked.

This section lists some of the limitations in different areas across the product:

[#table_wbm_p3s_dz,cols="50,133"]
|===
| Area | Description

| Powerful Query, Indexing, and Search
a|
[#ul_okg_4p5_xz]
* *Index Replicas Placement*
+
When deciding the index nodes to place index replicas, the system takes into account to not place replicas onto the same node, and to distribute the replicas across as many server groups as possible.
It then chooses the nodes the have the fewest number of indexes to place the replicas.
In the future, we will improve the replica placement algorithm to better optimize the memory, CPU, and disk usage across the index nodes.

* *Index Rebalance*
+
When adding new indexer nodes to a cluster to increase the capacity for indexes, the system will not move existing indexes onto the new nodes.
To rebalance indexes from existing nodes to the new nodes, user needs to eject the existing nodes and add the new nodes.
The system will then move indexes from the ejected nodes to the new nodes while balancing resource utilization.
This is known as swap rebalance.
+
Rebalance will not take into consideration any explicit index placement specified when an index was created.
A user cannot perform create/drop/build index during index rebalance.

* *Online Index Upgrade*
+
To perform online upgrade from version 4.x, you need to make sure all indexes on an index have at least one equivalent index (index with same definition) on other nodes.
One then fails-over the index node, upgrades the node to version 5.0, and then adds the node back to the cluster.
While the node is failed-over, the equivalent indexes on other nodes will be leveraged for queries.
+
Once the system has been upgraded to 5.0, you can use swap rebalance to perform online upgrade to future versions.

.4+| Upgrade
| If you are using GSI indexes with a previously GA'd release of Couchbase (such as 4.x) or Couchbase 5.0 Beta versions, we suggest that you drop the older index definitions and recreate them using 5.0 GA version with Plasma, the newly introduced storage engine for GSI.

| N1QL Application Continuity:

In 5.0 Beta 1 release, N1QL introduced multiple performance enhancements enabled by a new internal protocol between Query and Index services.
While upgrading large Couchbase cluster deployments, the cluster may be in a state where different Couchbase services are running on different versions.
In such scenarios, this feature ensures seamless continuity for N1QL queries and applications irrespective of whether the query and indexing services are running a 4.x or 5.0 version.
The N1QL clients can avail the 5.0 features and performance only when the issued query is processed by 5.0 query and indexing services.

| Many 5.0 features require the latest versions of Couchbase SDK.
It is critical to update the SDK before updating to 5.0.
Upgrade according to the SDK versions listed in the <<sdk-compatibility,SDK Compatibility>> chart.

| We’ve replaced the Windows [.path]_.exe_ installers with industry-standard MSI installer files in this release.
Consequently, only rolling upgrades from 4.x or earlier versions to 5.0 are supported.
// In future, we plan to
// support normal in-place upgrades from 5.0 to newer versions.

| SDK Compatibility
a|
Many 5.0 features require you to upgrade your client SDK versions.
The minimum versions that support the latest 5.0 features are shown below, newer versions are available through the Release Notes link.
Regardless of needing new features, it is always advised to upgrade to the newest SDK version.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-24429[MB-24429]
| When fetching data, if the data node failed to respond due to some reason, the query could hang as there was no timeout specified.
This has been addressed by passing the query request timeout parameter when fetching data.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-23150[MB-23150]
| The monitoring view for running queries provides details such as the node that’s processing the request, the client IP that initiated the request, and the running program type (i.e.
WorkBench, CBC, Java, .NET, CBQ, etc.).
This helps isolate rogue queries and unauthorized access.

| Deprecate XDCR API from [.path]_/internalSettings_ REST endpoint in 4.5
| [.path]_/Settings/replications_ REST endpoint will be available for all replication settings and provides the same functionality.

| N1QL: Deprecated the use of path-expressions in `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses.
a|
FROM and JOIN clauses should use only keyspaces.
Paths can be used for expressions in other clauses, operators, projections, and so on.

For example:

----
SELECT count(*) FROM `travel-sample`.schedule;
----

can be rewritten as:

----
SELECT count(*)  FROM `travel-sample` WHERE schedule IS NOT MISSING;
