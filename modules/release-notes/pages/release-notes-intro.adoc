[abstract]
Couchbase Server version 4.0 GA is now available.
Version 4.0 is a major release that provides new features such as N1QL and significant enhancements to indexing and storage.
The major innovations in 4.0 include multidimensional scaling (MDS), global secondary indexes (GSI), N1QL, XDCR filtering, the ForestDB storage engine, geospatial views, LDAP integration, and auditing for administrators.
These capabilities dramatically extend the scalability and performance advantages of Couchbase Server, as well as the ability to support a much broader set of use cases.

Couchbase Server 4.0 GA is released in October 2015.
