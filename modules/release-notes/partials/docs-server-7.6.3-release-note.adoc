=== Fixed Issues

This release contains the following fixes:

==== Cluster Manager

[#table-fixed-issues-763-cluster-manager,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63070[MB-63070]
| An issue occurred where `cbcollect_info` did not process some  `<ud>…</ud>` tags, especially when they were present at the end of the file or inside binary data. As a result, some logs that should have been redacted were not redacted.
| Issue resolved.

|===

==== Storage Engine
[#table-fixed-issues-763-storage-engine,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62984[MB-62984]
| When a Couchbase Data Service experiences a hard failover or crashes with data loss, DCP clients (like those used with Elasticsearch and Kafka) might receive incomplete or partial snapshots of the data. This incomplete data can lead to rare situations (edge cases) where the Data Service ends up crashing repeatedly.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63261[MB-63261]
| An issue occurred caused by a race condition in the index recovery code path, which may result in item count mismatch and wrong query results. Prior to Release 7.6.0, this  issue may occur during an Indexer restart.  However, as part of the file-based rebalance process introduced in 7.6.0,  a recovery of the index is performed after the index is moved, which increases the likelihood that this race condition might be reached.
| Issue resolved.

==== Query Service
[#table-fixed-issues-763-query-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63024[MB-63024]
a| A query may return the error `Nested aggregates not allowed` under the following conditions:

   * query contains in its FROM clause a subquery used as the inner of a join
   * the subquery is used as an inner of a nested-loop join in query plan
   * the subquery only accesses a single keyspace (i.e., no joins/nests/unnests)
   * the subquery contains one or more aggregates (e.g., COUNT) in its projection
   * the subquery contains a `GROUP BY` clause, and the `GROUP BY` list does not match index key order of any secondary indexes defined
   * a secondary index exists that allows index group/aggregate pushdown for the subquery
   * the cost-based optimizer is `ON` (which is the default), and a previous `UPDATE STATISTICS/ANALYZE` command has been run on the keyspace referenced in the subquery.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63060[MB-63060]
| An issue occurred when migrating nested UDFs to any 7.6.x release from a previous version. In cases when an inline UDF called another UDF, query nodes became unresponsive.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63078[MB-63078]
a| When upgrading to a 7.6.x release, if buckets were loaded by Query nodes before they were fully migrated to 7.6.x format, Query continually reloaded the bucket on access, leading to degraded performance. This issue has been resolved in 7.6.3.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63147[MB-63147]
| An issue occurred with user-defined functions (UDFs) that contained queries defined with a common-table expression (CTE). If the CTE contained references to the UDF arguments, the execution of the UDF  returned an error indicating “correlation reference `<with_alias>` is not allowed.”
| Issue resolved.

==== Index Service
[#table-fixed-issues-763-index-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63193[MB-63193]
| An issue in the rebalancer code caused several partitions to miss streaming mutations when partitioned indexes were moved during file-based rebalance.  This issue resulted in corrupt indexes, as not all data will be processed. The issue occurred only with partitioned indexes when file-based rebalance was enabled.
| Issue resolved.

|===


==== Analytics Service
[#table-fixed-issues-763-anaytics-service,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62923[MB-62923]
| TBD.
| Issue resolved.

| https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62949[MB-62949]|
When a query encounters a failure, the details of the exception can get masked by subsequent exceptions, leading to the loss of the root cause of the query failure.
| Issue resolved.
