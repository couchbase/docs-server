|Feature | Description

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59237/[MB-59237]

a| Prometheus now records information related to disk usage over time:

* Cumulative number of bytes read from CB Data volume over time.
* Cumulative number of bytes written to CB Data volume over time.
* Metrics tracked in Prometheus, similar to existing system metrics.
* Disk queue size over time (instantaneous sample of current size)
* Disk read latency.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59503/[MB-59503]
a| You can now have Couchbase Server prune rotated audit logs after a period of time. You set how long Couchbase Server should keep audit logs by using the new pruneAge parameter for the /settings/audit endpoint. The default value of 0 means that Couchbase Server does not prune audit logs. See xref:rest-api:rest-auditing.adoc[Configure Auditing].

=== Fixed Issues

=== Index Service
[#table-known-issues-724-index-service, cols="10, 40, 40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59646/[MB-59646]
| Indexes were not correctly created on nested arrays using the FLATTEN_KEYs function because null or missing entries were not expanded.
| Issue resolved. Null or missing entries are now expanded for nested arrays

=== XDCR
[#table-known-issues-724-xdcr, cols="10, 40, 40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58758[MB-58758]
| Erroneous network conditions could lead to the `checkpoint manager` to become slow at stopping.
| Ensure the `checkpoint manager` stops, even if it has trouble starting due to network issues.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59339[MB-59339]
|Race condition in starting and stopping XDCR source nozzle could lead to memory leak.
| Fixed race condition.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59446[MB-59466]
| If Bandwidth Throttler is used, race condition may occur during pipeline shutdown where Out nozzle is unable to exit.
| Fixed race condition during shutdown to ensure out nozzle closes properly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59476[MB-59476]
| Remote Cluster Service may be stuck and unable to update references modified by another node in the cluster
| Resync will take place if remote cluster metadata is out of sync to prevent references from being stuck and becoming stale.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59624[MB-59624]
| In low-priority replications, it is possible for a Data Service stream to end temporarily, which may not be handled correctly by XDCR, leading to hung replication.
| XDCR will restart the pipeline if a data service stream is ended. This will ensure that replication will continue.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59703[MB-59703]
|  If a replication is idle without mutations, XDCR is unable to detect that a target bucket failover occurred.
| Ensure target-side failover detection takes place even if the source has no incoming mutations.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59850[MB-59850]
|  In a slow running backfill replication, XDCR could be too aggressive in restarting pipelines.
| Ensure XDCR does not restart backfill pipelines if some progress is observed periodically

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59888[MB-59888]
| When a target document is locked, and a non-optimistic LWW replication is taking place, XDCR will retrieve a `locked CAS` of `maxUint`. This will cause the source mutation to always lose, and lead to scenarios where a source mutation is not replicated even if it should have won conflict resolution.
| XDCR will retry conflict resolution for the duration that the document is locked in a pessimistic replication, to ensure that a valid CAS is used for source-side conflict resolution.

=== Query Service

[#table-known-issues-724-query-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57903/[MB-57903]
| When a query has nested correlation references, e.g., `query1` contains a
  subquery `query2`, which in turn contains another subquery `query3`, and
  `query3` is correlated with `query1` (but `query2` is not correlated), the
  nested correlation is not properly detected and the subquery (`query2`)
  is not properly marked as correlated.
| Correlation references are detected and marked in different levels of
  sub-queries. Nested correlation references are properly propagated
  up such that all sub-queries are properly marked when correlated.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58648[MB-58648]
| Prepared statement with user-defined function can lead to a memory leak.
Caused by the UDF being reloaded.
| Fix applied. UDFs no longer being reloaded.
