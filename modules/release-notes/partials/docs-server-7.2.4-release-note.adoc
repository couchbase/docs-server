|Feature | Description

| The request is for `ns_server` to provide a REST interface to enter the minimum duration (in minutes) that previously rotated audit files will be retained. This value will be converted to seconds and passed through to memcached. The audit daemon, run during the log rotation task, will remove any files created more than X seconds ago.
