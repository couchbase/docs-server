=== Deprecated and Removed Features and Platforms


* The following platforms are still supported, but
deprecated in Couchbase Server{nbsp}7.6:

** Amazon Linux 2 LTS x86 & ARM
** Microsoft Windows Server 2019
** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS x86 & ARM
** MacOS 12 (Monterey) x86 & ARM

* We are removing these platforms from support (they are already deprecated):

** CentOS 7.x
** Debian Linux 10 (Buster)
** MacOS 11 (BigSur)
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.x

* Removed support for TLS `1.0` and `1.1`. Both the standards bodies and Couchbase have already deprecated these versions due to their lack of security. (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58045[MB-58045])

* The `cbbackup` and `cbrestore` utilities have been removed from Couchbase Server{nbsp}7.6. The same functionality is provided in `cbbackupmgr`.

* <<passwordless-deprecated,Removed support for password-less buckets>>.

* Customers using the Couchbase `yum` or `apt` repositories to install Couchbase Server on Linux must ensure they are using the latest version `1.0-13` of the couchbase-release meta-package prior to upgrading to Couchbase Server 7.6.0 or later. To check which version you currently have installed:

** On RPM-based systems: `rpm -q couchbase-release` (should return `couchbase-release-1.0-13.noarch`)
** On Debian-based systems: `dpkg -s couchbase-release|grep Version` (should return `Version: 1.0-13`)

+
If you have a version lower than `1.0-13` installed, please follow the instructions for xref:install:rhel-suse-install-intro.adoc#install-using-yum[Installing Couchbase Server on Red Hat]
or xref:install:ubuntu-debian-install.adoc#install-using-apt[ Installing Couchbase Server on Ubuntu and Debian] to install the latest couchbase-release meta-package.


[#fixed-issues-760]
=== Fixed Issues

This release contains the following fixes.


==== Cluster Manager
[#table-fixed-issues-76-cluster-manager,cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-60568[MB-60568]
| CPU utilization rate may be incorrect in a VM. +
When running a VM on a XEN hypervisor,
stats were computed using the number of processors configured for the entire system.
a| Stats now use the number of logical processors online on the system. This correction affects the following stats:

* `sys_cpu_host_cores_available`
* `sys_cpu_utilization_rate`
* `sys_cpu_host_utilization_rate`

|===


==== Data Service
[#table-fixed-issues-data-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58088[MB-58088]
| When the client sends an `unlock` request for a document that is not locked, the server returns a "temp fail" error code. This causes the client to retry until the operation times out.
| The server returns a new "not locked" error code.


| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59060[MB-59060]
| When the client sends an unlock request for a document that is not cached in Full Eviction mode, the server returns a "temp fail" error code, even if the document is stored on disk. This causes the client to retry until the operation times out.
| The metadata of locked documents are kept in the hashtable. The server returns a new "not locked" error code if the document exists, "not found" otherwise.

|===

==== XDCR
[#table-fixed-issues-76-xdcr, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58671[MB-58671]
| Erroneous network conditions could lead to checkpoint manager slow at stopping.
| Ensure the checkpoint manager stops, even if it has trouble starting due to network issues.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59233[MB-59233]
| In low-priority replications, it is possible for a Data Service stream to end temporarily and for XDCR to not handle it correctly. This will lead to a hung replication.
| Now, XDCR restarts the pipeline if a data service stream ends. +
  This ensures replication continues.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59320[MB-59320]
|  Race condition in starting and stopping XDCR source nozzle could lead to a memory leak
| Fixed the race condition

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59416[MB-59416]
|  If the Bandwidth throttler is used, race condition may occur during pipeline shutdown where the `Out` nozzle is unable to exit
| Fix race condition during shutdown to ensure out nozzle closes properly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59499[MB-59499]
| In a slow running backfill replication, XDCR could be too aggressive in restarting pipelines.
| Ensure XDCR does not restart backfill pipelines if some progress is observed periodically.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59669[MB-59669]
|  If a replication is idle without mutations, XDCR is unable to detect that a target bucket failover occurred.
| Ensure target-side failover detection takes place, even if the source has no incoming mutations

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59745[MB-59745]
| When a target document is locked, and a non-optimistic LWW replication is taking place, XDCR will retrieve a "locked CAS" of maxUint. This will cause the source mutation to lose, and lead to scenarios where the mutation is not replicated, even if it should have won conflict resolution.
| XDCR will retry conflict resolution for the duration that the document is locked in pessimistic replication. This will ensure that a valid CAS is used for source-side conflict resolution.

|===


==== Query Service
[#table-fixed-issues-76-query-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| [[passwordless-deprecated]] https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39484[MB-39484]
|  {sqlpp} will not support operations on legacy buckets without password specification.
| Users must  authenticate first to connect  to the query service and execute any SQL statement.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58648[MB-58648]
| Observed a memory leak with multiple executions of the same UDF function.
| Fix the condition whereby UDF functions are being re-loaded into cache from storage every time the function is executed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59501[MB-59501]
| The system catalog allows users to see items without RBAC authentication or authorization.
| Valid RBAC permissions are required to query the system catalog, and to view items stored in the catalog.
|===


==== Index Service
[#table-fixed-issues-76-index-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59138[MB-59138]
| The system did not support nested flattened array indexes when an entry was missing in nested arrays.
| The system now correctly expands null or missing entries for nested arrays.

|===

==== Search Service
[#table-fixed-issues-76-search-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57657[MB-57657]
a| When running non-analytic queries from {sqlpp} there was an expectation to use the keyword analyzer. If the user specified any other analyzer, then the analyzer expectation was not met, leading to the error: `No index available on keyspace`. +

The non-analytical queries are:

* TermQuery
* PhraseQuery
* MultiPhraseQuery
* FuzzyQuery
* PrefixQuery
* RegexpQuery
* WildcardQuery
|  This restriction has been lifted in 7.6.0. +
The user will now be able to run queries via {sqlpp} without having to run the keyword analyzer.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59858[MB-59858]
| When a Search index name is too long, the index silently fails to ingest documents.
|The UI will now flag instances where the chosen index name is too long.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-60718[MB-60718]
| Index alias queries not returning cumulative (duplicate) results from its targets.
| The fix prevents cyclic lockups within aliased index targets (aliases with the same targets pointing to each other to an infinite depth). +
 The service also de-duplicates index targets.

|===

==== Tools
[#table-fixed-issues-76-tools, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57988[MB-57988]
| `cli` should allow modifying existing collection's maxTTL
| The Couchbase CLI has been extended to allow the maxTTL (maximum time-to-live)  to be modified for a collection.

|===
|Issue | Description | Workaround

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59352[MB-59352]
| When the Load Metadata from File option is selected, the Couchbase Server UI does not disable two options that canâ€™t be used:  Validate metadata using trusted fingerprints and Verify Remote Peer. These two options are irrelevant during metadata upload. Selecting them will have no impact on the process.
| NA
|===

=== Failover
[#table-known-issues-760-failover, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Workaround

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-60062[MB-60062]
| When the auto-failover timeout setting is set to fewer than 5 seconds (the recommended minimum), you can no longer modify any cluster settings using the Couchbase Server UI. 
| Modify settings using the Nodes and Clusters REST API.
For more information on the auto-failover settings, see the documentation.

|Issue | Description | Workaround

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-61076[MB-61076]
| Scheduled merges (i.e. merges that are performed in a task in a plan) do not run. Note that backups scheduled for the merge are left in place so no data is lost. 
| Merge backups manually using the UI or using the API.
|===

=== Storage Engine
[#table-known-issues-760-storage-engine, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Workaround
