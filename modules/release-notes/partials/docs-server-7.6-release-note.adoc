| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58465[MB-58465]
| If an uncovered query only references specific fields, the fetch operation retrieves just the necessary fields from the Data service, instead of the entire document.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-57496[MB-57496]
| The SORT BY and GROUP BY operations overspill to disk if they exceed the Query service memory quota.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-53384[MB-53384]

This release contains the following fixes.

=== XDCR
[#table-known-issues-76-xdcr, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-58671[MB-58671]
| Erroneous network conditions could lead to checkpoint manager slow at stopping.
| Ensure the checkpoint manager stops, even if it has trouble starting due to network issues.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59233[MB-59233]
| In low-priority replications, it is possible for a Data Service stream to end temporarily and for XDCR to not handle it correctly. This will lead to a hung replication.
| Now, XDCR restarts the pipeline if a data service stream is ended. +
  This ensures replication continues

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59320[MB-59320]
|  Race condition in starting and stopping XDCR source nozzle could lead to a memory leak
| Fixed the race condition

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59416[MB-59416]
|  If the Bandwidth throttler is used, race condition may occur during pipeline shutdown where the `Out` nozzle is unable to exit
| Fix race condition during shutdown to ensure out nozzle closes properly.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59499[MB-59499]
| In a slow running backfill replication, XDCR could be too aggressive in restarting pipelines.
| Ensure XDCR does not restart backfill pipelines if some progress is observed periodically.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59669[MB-59669]
|  If a replication is idle without mutations, XDCR is unable to detect that a target bucket failover occurred.
| Ensure target-side failover detection takes place, even if the source has no incoming mutations

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59745[MB-59745]
| When a target document is locked, and a non-optimistic LWW replication is taking place, XDCR will retrieve a "locked CAS" of maxUint. This will cause the source mutation to lose, and lead to scenarios where the mutation is not replicated, even if it should have won conflict resolution.
| XDCR will retry conflict resolution for the duration that the document is locked in pessimistic replication. This will ensure that a valid CAS is used for source-side conflict resolution.

=== Query Service

[#table-known-issues-76-query-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39484[MB-39484]
| Remove {sqlpp} support for password-less buckets.
| Password-less bucket support removed.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-52228[MB-52228]
| CREATE INDEX fails when the index key expression matches the keyspace name.
| If the index key expression matches the keyspace name, the index key expression is no longer converted to SELF.

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-60762[MB-60762]
| ANSI MERGE with DELETE does not always generate an error when the target document matches multiple source documents.
| ANSI MERGE with DELETE now always generates an error when the target document matches multiple source documents, in compliance with the SQL standard.

|===

=== Search Service

[#table-known-issues-76-search-service, cols="10,40,40"]
|===
|Issue | Description | Resolution

| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-59858[MB-59858]
| When a Search index name is too long, the index silently fails to ingest documents.

|The UI will now flag instances where the chosen index name is too long.
