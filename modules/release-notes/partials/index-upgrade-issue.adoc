| https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-62547[MB-62547]
| A critical issue occurs when performing an offline-upgrade, graceful failover, or delta-recovery upgrade methods on index service nodes from Couchbase Server versions 7.1 through 7.2 to versions 7.6.0 or 7.6.1. 
The upgrade corrupts existing indexes requiring you to drop and rebuild them.
a| If you have one or more index service nodes, Couchbase suggests you wait for the next service patch for Couchbase Server (7.6.2), which resolves this issue.

To work around this issue, use the xref:install:upgrade-procedure-selection.adoc#swap-rebalance[Swap Rebalance method] when upgrading to Couchbase Server 7.6.x.
