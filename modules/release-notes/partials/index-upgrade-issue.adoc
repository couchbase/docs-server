a| A critical issue occurs when using the offline-upgrade or graceful failover/delta-recovery upgrade methods on Index Service nodes from Couchbase Server versions 7.1 through 7.2 to versions 7.6.0 or 7.6.1. 

WARNING: Using these methods to upgrade Index Service nodes to these versions corrupts existing indexes that require you to drop and rebuild them.

a| If you have one or more Index Service nodes, Couchbase suggests you delay upgrading until the release of the next service patch for Couchbase Server (7.6.2) which resolves this issue.

To work around this issue, use the xref:install:upgrade-procedure-selection.adoc#swap-rebalance[Swap Rebalance method] when upgrading to Couchbase Server 7.6.x.
