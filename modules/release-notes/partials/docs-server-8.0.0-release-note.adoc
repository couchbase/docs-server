https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63420[MB-63420]::
A server panic when processing a request containing a composite aggregate with a reference to the source (e.g., `MAX([d.date, d][1])` â€” note the order and the array element access being within the aggregate) has been resolved.
+
The more common form, (e.g., `MAX([d.date, d])[1]` was not affected.


https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-63518[MB-63518]::
An issue occurs
when setting `completed-stream-size` to 0 when it is already set to 0 via the admin REST API, but the API call did not complete.
Thereafter, access to vital information was blocked. +
The issue has now been resolved.
Prior to this fix, the only way to rectify the situation was to restart the query process on the affected node(s).
