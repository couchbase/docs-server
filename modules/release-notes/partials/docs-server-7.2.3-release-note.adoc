| DCP nozzle race would leave gomemcached feed running and leak memory. +
Normally, if DCP nozzles are started and then stopped in sequence, there shouldnâ€™t be any UprFeed leaks.
Hard-coded testing resulted in situations indicating that the leaking gomemcached feed wasn't closed.
| Fixed: the feed is correctly synchronized and closed.
