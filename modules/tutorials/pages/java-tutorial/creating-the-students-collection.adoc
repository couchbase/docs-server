== Introduction
Working with any database SDK usually involves the following operations:

. Connect to the database
. Carry out CRUD{crud-footnote} operations
. Disconnect from the database (important for resource cleanup)

Fortunately, the Couchbase SDK follows the same pattern, so the first thing you're going to do is write the code to connect to your document store.

== Connecting to the  database [[connecting-to-the-database]]

In the xref:java-tutorial/install-couchbase-java-sdk.adoc[] tutorial, you created a directory structure to hold your application.
Create the file `student.java` in the `java` directory as shown below.

include::partial$student-mvn-directory-structure.adoc[tags="location-of-student.java"]

Add the following content to the `ConnectStudent.java` file.

[source, java]
----
include::{java-sample-location}ConnectStudent.java[]
----

If you're familiar with the JDBC API then connecting to a Couchbase server is not that different:

<1> A call to `Cluster.connect` creates a channel to the named server (`localhost` running on your local machine in this case), supplying your username and password to authenticate the connection.

<2> The retrieved `cluster` is used to retrieve the bucket set up in xref:install-couchbase-server.adoc[].

<3> {why-waitUntilReady} Once the function has finished, it sends a notification to its caller, which
will then process the output of the call. +
Now this usually works very well in practice, but in our simple example there is a problem: after we make the call
to `cluster.bucket`, the program will carry on without waiting for the bucket retrieval to be complete.
This means we're now trying to retrieve the scope from a bucket object that hasn't been fully initialised. +
This is where the `waitUntilReady` call comes in. This will force the program to wait until the bucket object is
fully prepared.

<4> Retrieves the `art-school-scope` from the bucket.

<5> Retrieves the student collection from the scope.

<6> The next line is just a check to make sure we have connected and retrieved the collection when the program is run.
You can see the output by running it through maven:

<7> And as with all database systems, it's good practise to disconnect from the Couchbase cluster once you've
finished working with it.

[source, console]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ConnectStudent" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----

Somewhere in the output, you'll find the line containing the name of the collection you've successfully retrieved:

TIP: As an experiment, try commenting out the `bucket.waitUntilReady` call, then run the program again. What happens?

Okay, so you've connected to the cluster and retrieved your collection.
Unfortunately, there's nothing in there to see at the moment, so the next thing to do is create a few records.

== Populating the student collection

Remember that Couchbase is a xref:couchbase-tutorial-student-records.adoc#database-design[document store], not a
relational database in the traditional sense.
Rather than storing data in tables, you're going to create a document in JSON and insert it into the `student-record-collection`.
Here's Hilary Smith's student record (minus the enrollment details â€“ we'll come to that later):

[source, json]
----
include::partial$hilary-smith-basic.json[]
----

Start by creating the file `InsertStudent.java` in the `java` directory:

[source, java]
----
include::{java-sample-location}InsertStudent.java[]
----

<.> Up to this point, it's pretty much the same as the `ConnectStudent` class: mainly the boilerplate code to connect to the cluster and access the collection.

<.> Since Couchbase is primarily a store for JSON documents, it makes sense to include a whole class of functionality for creating and manipulating data in the JSON format.
In this case, use the `JsonObject` class to create and populate Hilary's student record.
+
[NOTE]
====
JSON doesn't have its own `date` type, and so Couchbase doesn't have a native data type either.
The recommended way of dealing with dates is to store them as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO-8601]-formatted strings.
====
{empty}

<.> The `upsert` function is used to insert or update documents in a collection.
The first parameter is a unique identifier for the document (much like the primary key used in relational database systems).
If `upsert` call finds a document with a matching identifier in the collection, then the document is updated.
If there is no existing identifer, then a new record is created.

When you run the program:

[source, console]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="InsertStudent" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----

nothing much happens. You can return to the Couchbase administrator's console and examine the contents of the `student-record-collection`.

image::hilarys-record-in-admin-console.png[alt="Student record showing in the web console"]

And there it is: a single document with an id of `000001` belonging to Hilary Smith.

Before carrying on to the next section, change your program so you can add a student record for `Ashley Jones`.
