== Populating the course details collection

You can use the same technique to build a store for the courses.
Here's a quick reminder of the course document structure:

[tabs]
====
art history::
+
--
[source, json]
----
include::partial$art-history-course.json[]
----
--

graphic design::
+
--
[source, json]
----
include::partial$graphic-design-course.json[]
----
--

fine art::
+
--
[source, json]
----
include::partial$fine-art-course.json[]
----
--

[NOTE]
====
The documents include an additional `type` field.
Do you remember why we include a `type` for all our documents?

=====
Documents of different types can reside in the same bucket/collection, so it's useful to include a field which can be used to filter documents by type.

The code should be familiar to you; there's not much difference between writing to the course collection and writing to the student collection; you just have more records to deal with:

[source, java]
----
include::{java-sample-location}InsertCourses.java[]
----

<.> Note that you're now writing to a different collection.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you've created the `course-collection` in the admin console before you attempt to run the program.

You can use maven to run the application:

[source, console]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="InsertCourses" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----

Use the admin console to make sure the documents have been created in the correct collection.

== Next steps

So you've created a cluster, a bucket, a scope and two collections.
You've also populated your collections with documents.
Well, a database isn't much use until we can retrieve information from it, which is what you're going to take a look at in the xref:java-tutorial/retrieving-documents.adoc[next part].
