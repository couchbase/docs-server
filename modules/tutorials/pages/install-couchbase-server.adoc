== Installation

The easiest way to get started with Couchbase is to use the https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[Capella], which allows you to set up, administer and run Couchbase clusters as a cloud service.

{point-to-capella}

This tutorial focuses on running Couchbase as a standalone application, or a `Docker` instance.

Standalone install::
+
--

Using any browser, navigate to https://www.couchbase.com/downloads to download the server installation pack.

Pick the `Couchbase server` option for your free trial.

NOTE: You may need to fill out a brief web form before you can download the installation package.

Select `Couchbase Server`, and from there, download the community edition of the server.

NOTE: Make sure you download the latest version of the server software.

Once you've downloaded the software, install it on your machine. (The method for installation will depend on your operating system).

The method for running the application will, again, depend on your host operating system.
In our example, we're using a Mac, so the installation will place then executable app in the standard `Applications` folder.

--

Docker install::
+
--
First, make sure that you have Docker installed and running on your system. (You can download it from https://www.docker.com/get-started[here]).

Open a terminal window and run the following command:
[source, bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
docker run -t --name db -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 \
couchbase/server:enterprise-{current-enterprise-version}
----

This will provision the server image, set up the storage location and run the server.

== Set up a new cluster

Each Couchbase server can run as its own cluster, or join another cluster to form a multi-node system.
For the purposes of this basic tutorial, we're only going to concern ourselves with running as a single node.

TIP: You can always find the server's configuration page by pointing your browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8091`.

image::launch-couchbase-server-page.png[alt="Click button to set up new cluster", ]

Press btn:[Setup New Cluster] to create your new cluster.
The next page will allow you to fill in details for the cluster:

image::enter-cluster-details.png[alt="Enter the cluster details"]

Since we're going to be housing student records, let's call the cluster `student-cluster`.
You'll also need an admin username and a strong yet memorable password.
Since this is just a demonstration, leave the administrator username as `Administrator`. After you've filled in the details, press btn:[Next: Accept Terms].

TIP: Since this is a tutorial, then feel free to use something like `password` for your password.
In a real system, of course, you'll use something much stronger.

On the next page, you'll find the terms and conditions for using Couchbase.
If you're happy with them, then check the box and press btn:[Finish with Defaults].

You're now on the main dashboard page.

== Next steps
Now you have installed the server and created a cluster, the next thing to do is create the database where you're going to store your documents.
In xref:buckets-scopes-and-collections.adoc[] you will also learn other ways in which Couchbase allows you to logically partition your data.
