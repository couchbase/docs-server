== Introduction
Working with any database SDK usually involves the following operations:

. Connect to the database
. Carry out CRUD{crud-footnote} operations
. Disconnect from the database (important for resource cleanup)

Fortunately, the Couchbase SDK follows the same pattern, so the first thing you're going to do is write the code to
connect to your document store.

== Connecting to the  database

In the xref:install-couchbase-java-sdk.adoc[] tutorial, you created a directory structure to hold your application.
Create the file `student.java` in the `java` directory as shown below.

include::partial$student-mvn-directory-structure.adoc[tags="location-of-student.java"]

Add the following content to the `student.java` file.
