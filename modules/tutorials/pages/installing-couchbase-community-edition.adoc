= Installing Couchbase: Community Edition
:description: A short tutorial that will guide the developer in downloading and installing Couchbase, then creating a database to store our student records.

== Installation
Couchbase can be installed as either:

* A standalone application
* A Docker instance
* A Virtualbox/Vagrant installation

To keep things quick and simple, we're just going to carry out a basic standalone installation. Download the lastest version of the standalone installer from here:

https://www.couchbase.com/downloads

Pick the `Couchbase server` option for your free trial.

NOTE: You may need to fill out a brief web form before you can download the installation package.

Select `Couchbase Server`, and from there, download the community edition of the server.

NOTE: Make sure you download the latest version of the server software.

Once you've downloaded the software, install it on your machine. (The method for installation will depend on your operating system).

The method for running the application will, again, depend on your host operating system. In our example, we're using a Mac, so the installation will place then executable app in the standard `Applications` folder:

Double-click the icon to run the server. The server will launch, and since this is the first time it's run, it'll open up a web page inviting you to start a new cluster.

== Set up a new cluster

Each Couchbase server can run as its own cluster, or join another cluster to form a multi-node system. For the purposes of this basic tutorial, we're only going to concern ourselves with running as a single cluster.

TIP: You can always find the server's configuration page by pointing your browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8091`

Press btn:[Setup New Cluster] to create your new cluster. The next page will allow you to fill in details for the cluster:

Since we're going to be housing student records, let's call the cluster `student-cluster`. You'll also need an admin username and a strong yet memorable password. Since this is just a demonstration, leave the administrator username as `Admininstrator`. After you've filled in the details, press btn:[Next: Accept Terms].

On the next page, you'll find the terms and conditions for using Couchbase. If you're happy with them, then check the box and press btn:[Finish with Defaults].

You're now on the main dashboard page, a mostly blank screen displaying a message telling you that you currently have no buckets:

*So what is a `Bucket` exactly?*

If you think in database terms, a Couchbase Bucket is analogous to a database: it's the data store where you're going to store and retrieve related information about the students.

You can click on the menu:Dashboard[Buckets] link to access the Buckets page, then click on btn:[Add Bucket]

And from this dialog, you can create the `student-bucket`

Once you have entered `student-bucket` for the bucket's name, press the btn:[Add Bucket] button to return to the main bucket list.

== What next â€¦?
So you have a database. Next thing to do is add stuff to it, then retrieve it again. This is easy enough to do from the adminstration application, but we're going to build a small app
