== So What is a Bucket Exactly?

If you think in database terms, a Couchbase Bucket is analogous to a database: it's the data store where you're going to store and retrieve related information about the students.

When you install Couchbase, you'll be provided with a `default` bucket, but you are free to add your own.

You can click on the menu:Dashboard[Buckets] link to access the Buckets page, then click on btn:[Add Bucket]

And from this dialog, you can create the `student-bucket`

Once you have entered the bucket name, press the btn:[Add Bucket] button to return to the main bucket list.


== Scopes and Collections

There's nothing stopping you from dumping every document into the default bucket, but in all but the simplest cases, it's better to provide some kind of separation between documents of different types.
Couchbase has a simple hierarchy model which allows for such separation:

include::partial$student-database-diagrams.adoc[tags="couchbase-hierarchy"]

You're already familiar with `clusters`, `nodes` and `buckets`.
Inside a bucket you can also have any number of `scopes`, and inside a `scope` you can have any number of `collections`.
Scopes and collections appear to do the same thing, so we'll look at the key differences below:

[horizontal]
scopes:: acts as a parent to a collection.
You can apply permissions at the scope level, which will restrict access to the collections inside it.
collections:: a collection can contain a set of related documents.


NOTE: Remember `scopes` and `collections` are optional: you can insert documents direcly into a `bucket` if you wish.

Rather than have our student records stored in an anonymous bucket, we're going to add two collections: one will be used to store the student records, the other will be used to store the course details.

Now looking again at the relational design of our student database:

include::partial$student-database-diagrams.adoc[tags="student-record-erd"]

We can see that our equivalent document-based system could do with a little decomposition:

include::partial$student-database-diagrams.adoc[tags="student-document-database-design"]

So, inside our `student-bucket` we've set up a scope called `art-school-scope`.
Perhaps we have a number of schools and we want to restrict access to the school based on the role of the user; using scopes is the ideal way to do it.

Within the `scope` we set up two collections:

[horizontal]
`student-record-collection`:: contains the student records, and within each student record we carry a list of all
their enrollments.
Again, this moves away from the standard relational decomposition since we're actually storing the
enrollments as part of the student's record, instead of implementing it as a link table between the students and the courses.

`course-record-collection`:: The enrollment records will carry a link to the course record it applies to, so we can
retrieve other details such as the full name of the course and the number of credit points the student receives for
completing it.

NOTE: Of course, it's possible to just add the details of the course to the student's enrollment records, but this
would be very bad design.
Changing the credit points on the course, for example, would involve running through every
student's enrollments and changing the credit details on each one.
This is why the document model and relational model are used in conjunction to get the best combination of robust design and performance.

Now that you understand the basics of scopes and collections, return to your admininstration screen so we can add
them to your bucket.

=== Adding the student scope

Return to the `Buckets` screen and click the btn:[Scopes & Collections] link.

image::click-scopes-and-collections.png[]

The first thing you may notice is that your bucket is created with a pre-existing scope called `_default`.
You're going to ignore this and create your own scope with a more meaningful name. Click on the btn:[Add Scope] link.

On the next dialog, create your `art-school-scope`.

image::create-scope.png[width={image-width}]

Press btn:[Save] to save the new scope and return to the bucket screen.
The new scope should be showing in the list.

== Adding the collections

Next, we're going to add two collections for the new scope. Click the btn:[Add Collection] link for the
`art-school-scope'.

image::add-collection-link.png[]

When the collection dialog is displayed, fill in the name of the first collection: `student-record-collection`; then
press  btn:[save]

Now do the same again to create the `course-record-collection`.

You should now have the `art-school-scope` containing your two collections.

== Next steps

So you have your cluster, bucket, scope and collections set up and ready to be populated.
In the next section, you'll set up your system to write your first Couchbase application.
