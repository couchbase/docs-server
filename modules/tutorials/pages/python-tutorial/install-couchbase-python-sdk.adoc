== Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need Python Version {minimum-python-version} installed on your machine. If you don't have a Python installed (or you have version 2 or less) then the best way to get hold of Python is to use a _virtual environment manager._ This will allow you to have different versions of Python and its libraries on the same machine.

For further information on installing Python, take a look at xref:python-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Install and Start Using the Python SDK with Couchbase Server]
