= Retrieving documents

[abstract]
In this section, you're going to look at two methods of retrieving documents from a collection: you will use the administration console to build simple queries, and also write a short program to retrieve documents matching certain criteria. Both of the methods will introduce `N1QL` (pronounced _nickel_), Couchbase's SQL-based query language.
