:description: In this tutorial, you're going to create a skeleton application for interacting with the student database you created in xref:installing-couchbase-community-edition.adoc[]

{description}

== Prerequisites

Java is a fairly popular programming language these days, so we're going to use it to build our student/course application. To keep things as light as possible (this is a tutorial, after all), we're not going to worry about building a web front end or REST service, just a few methods to read/write our documents to the database.

You will need a few things installed on your machine before you begin:

* The Java Software Development Kit (version 15+).
* Apache Maven (version 3+)

TIP: https://sdkman.io/[SDKMan] is the easiest way to install and manage JDKs and Maven on your host machine.

== Set up

Create the following directory structure on your machine:

include::partial$student-mvn-directory-structure.adoc[tags="basic"]

Create a new file in the directory called `pom.xml` in the `student` directory. The pom file should be populated with the following content.

.pom.xml
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>org.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>couchbase-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>16</maven.compiler.target>
        <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>${encoding}</project.build.sourceEncoding>
        <project.reporting.outputEncoding>${encoding}</project.reporting.outputEncoding>
        <project.resources.sourceEncoding>${encoding}</project.resources.sourceEncoding>
        <archetype.encoding>${encoding}</archetype.encoding>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>    <!--1-->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
            <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
            <version>3.2.1</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

</project>
----

<1> The `dependencies` section lists all the libraries required to build the application. In our case, we only need the Couchbase client SDK (version 3.2.1, in this case).

include::partial$student-mvn-directory-structure.adoc[tags="location-of-pom.xml"]

You can test the set up is correct by opening a terminal window and changing to the `student` directory. Run the the build script to pull in all the dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
mvn install

== What's next â€¦?

You're now ready to write your first Couchbase application.
