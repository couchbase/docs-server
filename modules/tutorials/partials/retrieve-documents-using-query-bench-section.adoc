= Using the Query Editor

Return to the admin console, and click on the menu:Query[] item on the left-hand menu.

This will take you to the query workbench. The workbench has a few filter fields that'll make it much easier to narrow down our search criteria.

Use the two dropdown items to select the `student-bucket` and the `art-school-scope`. This narrows the scope of the queries, meaning you don't have to add the name of the bucket and the scope to your queries.

Okay, let's try a simple query to retrieve all the course in our collection.

Type the following query into the query editor field:

[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc
----

NOTE: {sqlpp} is very similar to standard SQL. Once you have mastered the document database model, you'll find it very easy to adapt.

What happens when you hit btn:[Execute]?

You get an error message returned from the cluster:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "code": 4000,     // <1>
    "msg": "No index available on keyspace `default`:`student-bucket`.`art-school-scope`.`course-record-collection` that matches your query. Use CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `default`:`student-bucket`.`art-school-scope`.`course-record-collection` to create a primary index, or check that your expected index is online.",    // <2>
    "query": "select * from `course-record-collection`"    // <3>
  }
]
----
<1> The internal Couchbase code for the message.
<2> A plain text description telling you what happened. In this case, the problem is that there no index defined on our bucket, so the search couldn't locate any key information.
<3> The JSON message also returns the original query.

== Creating an index

Fortunately, you can use the same query editor to add an index to the bucket. To do this, enter the following command into the editor and press btn:[Enter].

[source, sqlpp]
----
create primary index course_idx on `course-record-collection`
----

This will create a single index (`course_idx`) on your `course-record-collection`.

TIP: The error message returned from the search statement provides an example command for creating the primary index. You can copy the example command and run it in the query editor to create your primary index.

Okay, now if you run the `select` query again â€¦

[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc
----

Now you should get a result:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "graphic design",
    "credit-points": 200,
    "faculty": "media and communication"
  }
]
----

Okay, now try something else: returning the courses with `credit-points` of less than 200:

[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc where crc.`credit-points` < 200
----

which will bring back:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  }
]
----

=== But what about the primary id field?

Good question. You may want to get hold of `id` field, which as you can see, isn't returned with the document, even if we're asking for all the fields in the call. The primary key exists as part of the document's "meta" structure, which can be interrogated along with the rest of the document. Make the following small adjustment to the `{sqlpp}` statement and run the query again:

[source, sqlpp]
----
select META().id, crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc where crc.`credit-points` < 200
----

The `META()` function call will return any property contained in the document's metadata, including its id:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art",
    "id": "ART-HISTORY-000001"    // <1>
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art",
    "id": "FINE-ART-000002"    // <1>
  }
]
----

<1> id fields added to the returned document.
