[abstract]
N1QL has a system catalog that stores metadata about a database.
The system catalog is a namespace called _system_.

There is a keyspace for each type of artifact.
The keyspace names are plural in order to avoid conflicting with N1QL keywords.

== Logical Hierarchy

N1QL has the following artifacts:

Datastores::

Datastores are similar to sites.
A datastore is a database deployment, for example, a server cluster, cloud service, or mobile installation.
It is analogous to a relation database instance.

Namespaces::

Namespaces are similar to pools.
A namespace is a unit of authorization, resource allocation, and tenancy.
It is analogous to a relational database or schema.

Buckets::

A bucket is the fundamental unit for storing data in Couchbase Server.
Each bucket contains at least one scope by default, and you can create more scopes as required.
It is analogous to a relational database table space or file group.

Scopes::

A scope is a set of one or more collections.
Each scope contains at least one collection by default, and you can create more collections as required.
It is analogous to a group of relational database tables.

Collections::

A collection is a set of documents that may vary in structure.
It is a unit of authorization and resource allocation.
It is analogous to a relational database table.

Keyspaces::

Keyspaces map to collections in Couchbase Server.
A keyspace may be referred to in full, using a keyspace path.
For example,`default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.modes.train` refers to the `train` collection in the `modes` scope in the `travel-sample` bucket.
The keyspace may also be referred to using just the collection name for short, for example when the namespace, bucket, and scope are implied by the current query context.
+
For compatibility with legacy versions of Couchbase Server, the name of the scope and collection may be omitted when referring to the default collection in the default scope within a bucket.
So for example, we may refer to the `travel-sample` keyspace, meaning the default collection in the default scope in the `travel-sample` bucket.
+
The term is also used to refer to any of the keyspaces in the `system` namespace.

Indexes::

An index on a keyspace.
It is analogous to a relational database index.
Types of indexes include b-tree (ForestDB or MOI) and view indexes.

Dual::

The dual keyspace has been added for evaluating constant expressions.
It contains a single entry with no attributes.

[#querying-datastores]
== Querying Datastores

You can query datastores using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:datastores
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the datastore)
* [.out]`url`: string (URL for the datastore instance)

[#querying-namespaces]
== Querying Namespaces

You can query namespaces using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:namespaces
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the namespace)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the namespace)
* [.out]`datastore_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the namespace belongs)

[#querying-keyspaces]
== Querying Keyspaces

You can query keyspaces using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:keyspaces
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the keyspace)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the keyspace)
* [.out]`namespace_id`: string (id for the namespace to which the keyspace belongs)
* [.out]`datastore_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the keyspace belongs)

[#querying-indexes]
== Querying Indexes

You can query indexes using the `SELECT` statement as follows:

----
SELECT * FROM system:indexes
----

The query returns the following attributes:

* [.out]`id`: string (id for the index)
* [.out]`name`: string (name for the index)
* [.out]`index_key`: array of strings (list of index keys)
* [.out]`using`: string (type of index, for example, gsi)
* [.out]`state`: string (state of index, for example, online)
* [.out]`keyspace_id`: string (id for the keyspace to which the index belongs)
* [.out]`namespace_id`: string (id for the namespace to which the index belongs)
* [.out]`datastore_id`: string (id for the datastore to which the index belongs)

[#querying-dual]
== Querying Dual

You can use dual to evaluate constant expressions.

----
SELECT 2+5 FROM system:dual
----

The query returns the result of the  expression, 7 in this case.
