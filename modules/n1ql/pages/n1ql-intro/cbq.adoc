= Running N1QL Queries from a Command Line

[abstract]
[.cmd]`cbq` is the command line shell that you can use to issue N1QL queries on Couchbase Server.

To run [.cmd]`cbq`:

. Log in to a Couchbase Server node that has the query service enabled.
. Open a command window.
. Change to the Couchbase tools directory.
+
----
# On Linux systems:
$ cd /opt/couchbase/bin
----
+
----
# On OS X systems:
$ cd /Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin
----

. Run the following command to connect to the local query node and start the interactive query shell:

 $ ./cbq
+
[NOTE]
====
Run the following command to connect to the cluster, the IP address can be any node in the cluster as cbq will automatically discover the query nodes:

----
./cbq -engine=http://123.45.67.89:8091
----
====

. At the [.cmd]`cbq` prompt, enter a N1QL query and end the query with a semicolon.
Press return to execute the query.
For example:
+
----
cbq> create primary index on `beer-sample`;
----
+

== Accessing a Secure Bucket

If your bucket has a password, you need to pass the bucket name and bucket password like so:

----
./cbq -engine="http://<bucketname>:<bucketpassword>@123.45.67.89:8091/"
----

For the 'beer-sample' bucket, if you add a password to it of _w1fg2Uhj89_ (as by default it has none), the command to start [.cmd]`cbq` would look like this:

----
./cbq -engine="http://beer-sample:w1fg2Uhj89@123.45.67.89:8091/"
----

If you want to access all of the buckets in the same cbq session, you would pass in the Administrator username and password instead of the bucket level.

----
./cbq -engine="http://Administrator:password@123.45.67.89:8091/"
----

NOTE: These commands execute successfully only if you have loaded sample bucket 'beer-sample' either at install or from the Settings menu in the web UI.

== Exiting [.cmd]`cbq`

Type [.in]`Ctrl-D` to exit [.cmd]`cbq`.

== Keyboard Shortcuts for cbq
