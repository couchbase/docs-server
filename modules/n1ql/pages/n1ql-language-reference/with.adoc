= WITH clause
:description: pass:q[Use `WITH` to create a *common table expression*.]

[abstract]
{description}
The common table expression may be temporary result set that can be used as a data source for the query, or an expression for later use within a query.

== Purpose

Common table expressions or CTEs can be used to simplify complex queries.
They can also be particularly useful when a value needs to be used several times in a query.

The WITH clause has comparable functionality to the xref:n1ql-language-reference/let.adoc[LET] clause.
The major difference between the WITH clause and the LET clause is that the WITH clause can come before the SELECT clause, enabling an earlier definition of expressions; whereas the LET clause must come after the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause.

The WITH clause is evaluated once per query block, and LET is evaluated for every object produced by the FROM or JOIN clause.

You can chain WITH clauses.
A CTE that you create in one WITH clause may be referenced in a later WITH clause.

== Prerequisites

The WITH clause can only be used preceding a SELECT statement, and in order for you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.

xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== Arguments

alias:: [Required] String or xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] that represents the name of the variable.

select:: xref:n1ql-language-reference/selectclause.adoc[SELECT] statement that returns a temporary result set assigned to [.var]`alias`.

== Examples

.Use a common table expression to create an expression for use in a query
====
Find the average number of public likes for each record.
Then find all hotels with a greater than average number of public likes.

[source,n1ql]
----
WITH avgLikeCount AS (
  SELECT VALUE AVG(DISTINCT ARRAY_COUNT(cte.public_likes))
  FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel AS cte
)
SELECT hotel.name, ARRAY_COUNT(hotel.public_likes) AS likeCount
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel
WHERE ARRAY_COUNT(hotel.public_likes) > avgLikeCount[0]
LIMIT 5;
