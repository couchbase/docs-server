= WITH clause
:description: pass:q[Use `WITH` to create a *common table expression*.]
:page-status: Couchbase Server 6.5

[abstract]
{description}
The common table expression may be temporary result set that can be used as a data source for the query, or an expression for later use within a query.

== Purpose

Common table expressions or CTEs can be used to simplify complex queries.
They can also be particularly useful when a value needs to be used several times in a query.

The WITH clause has comparable functionality to the xref:n1ql-language-reference/let.adoc[LET] clause.
The major difference between the WITH clause and the LET clause is that the WITH clause can come before the SELECT clause, enabling an earlier definition of expressions; whereas the LET clause must come after the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause, and can only be used in subselects.

The WITH clause is evaluated once per query block, and LET is evaluated for every object produced by the FROM or JOIN clause.

You can chain WITH clauses.
A CTE that you create in one WITH clause may be referenced in a later WITH clause.

== Prerequisites

The WITH clause can only be used preceding a SELECT statement, and in order for you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.

xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

Find the average number of public likes for each record.
Then find all hotels with a greater than average number of public likes.

FROM `travel-sample` AS hotel
WHERE ARRAY_COUNT(hotel.public_likes) > avgLikeCount[0]
LIMIT 5;
