= FROM clause

[abstract]
The `FROM` clause specifies the keyspaces and JOIN operations on them.

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

== Purpose

In a `SELECT` query or subquery, the `FROM` clause specifies one or more of the following:

* Keyspaces
* Subqueries (such as derived tables)
* JOIN clauses
* JOIN conditions
* Expressions (nested collections, `CURL()`, or other expressions)

== Prerequisites

For you to select data from keyspace or expression, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on that keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].

[#sec_from-keyspace]
== from-keyspace

You can specify a keyspace to query from, either a specific bucket or a constant expression.
If the [.var]`from-keyspace` clause is used, then there must be a [.var]`from-keyspace-name` specified.

The simplest type of from-keyspace clause specifies a single bucket (i.e., `pass:c[SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`]`).

Keyspace identifier is the name or identifier of an independent place for a data source of one or more documents.
Such keyspaces are not dependent on any of the xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc#section_onz_3tj_mz[Variable in Scope of a Subquery].

*from-keyspace Example:* Use a keyspace from a single bucket.

Select four unique landmarks from the `pass:c[`travel-sample`]` bucket.

----
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
LIMIT 4;
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "name": "Royal Engineers Museum"
  },
  {
    "name": "Hollywood Bowl"
  },
  {
    "name": "Thai Won Mien"
  },
  {
    "name": "Spice Court"
  }
]
----

*N1QL Expressions in a FROM Clause*

Couchbase Server version 4.6.2 added support for generic xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expressions] in the `from-term` clause; and this adds huge flexibility by the enabling of various N1QL functions, operators, path expressions, language constructs on constant expressions, variables, and subqueries to create just about any FROM clause imaginable.

* When the `from-term` is an expression, `USE KEYS` or `USE INDEX` clauses are not allowed.
* When using a `JOIN` clause, `NEST` clause, or `UNNEST` clause, the left-side keyspace can be an expression or subquery, but the right-side keyspace must be a keyspace identifier.
*1. Independent Constant Expression*::
This includes any N1QL expressions of JSON scalar values, static JSON literals, objects, or N1QL functions, for example:
+
----
SELECT * FROM [1, 2, "name", { "type" : "airport", "id" : "SFO"}]  AS  ks1;

SELECT CURL("https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json",
           {"data":"address=Half+Moon+Bay" , "request":"GET"} );
----
+
Note that functions such as xref:n1ql-language-reference/curl.adoc[CURL()] can independently produce input data objects for the query.
Similarly, other N1QL functions can also be used in the expressions.

*2. Variable N1QL Expression*::
This includes expressions that refer to any xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc#section_onz_3tj_mz[variables in scope] for the query, for example:
+
----
SELECT count(*)
FROM `travel-sample` t
LET x = t.geo
WHERE (SELECT RAW y.alt FROM x y)[0] > 6000;
----
+
The `FROM x` clause is an expression that refers to the outer query.
This is applicable to only subqueries because the outermost level query cannot use any variables in its own `FROM` clause.
This makes the subquery correlated with outer queries, as explained in the xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc[Subqueries] section.

*3. Subquery and Subquery Expressions*::
*Subquery Example:* For each country, find the number of airports at different altitudes and their corresponding cities.
+
In this case, the inner query finds the first level of grouping of different altitudes by country and corresponding number of cities.
Then the outer query builds on the inner query results to count the number of different altitude groups for each country and the total number of cities.
+
----
SELECT t1.country, num_alts, total_cities
FROM (SELECT country, geo.alt AS alt,
             count(city) AS num_cities
      FROM `travel-sample`
      WHERE type = "airport"
      GROUP BY country, geo.alt) t1
GROUP BY t1.country
LETTING num_alts = count(t1.alt), total_cities = sum(t1.num_cities);
----
+
Results:
+
----
[
  {
    "country": "United States",
    "num_alts": 946,
    "total_cities": 1560
  },
  {
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "num_alts": 128,
    "total_cities": 187
  },
  {
    "country": "France",
    "num_alts": 196,
    "total_cities": 221
  }
]
----
+
This is equivalent to blending the results of the following two queries by country, but the subquery in the `from-term` above simplified it.
+
----
SELECT country,count(city) AS num_cities
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "airport"
GROUP BY country;

SELECT country, count(distinct geo.alt) AS num_alts
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "airport"
GROUP BY country;
----
+

[#section_ax5_2nx_1db]
== AS Alias

To use a shorter or clearer name anywhere in the query, like SQL, N1QL allows renaming fields by using the AS keyword to assign an alias to a keyspace or field in the `FROM` clause.

*Syntax*

----
[AS] alias
----

*Arguments*

`AS`:: [Optional] Reserved word denoting the next word is an alias of the previous term.

alias::
[Required if `AS` is used] String to assign a name to a keyspace, such as the following equivalent `FROM` clauses with and without the `AS` keyword:
+
[cols=2*]
|===
| `pass:c[FROM `travel-sample`]` `AS t`
| `pass:c[FROM `travel-sample`]` `t`

| `pass:c[FROM `travel-sample`]` `AS h`

`pass:c[INNER JOIN `travel-sample`]` `AS l`

`ON (``h``.city =` `l``.city)`
| `pass:c[FROM `travel-sample`]` `h`

`pass:c[INNER JOIN `travel-sample`]` `l`

`ON (``h``.city =` `l``.city)`
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
Since the original name may lead to referencing wrong data and wrong results, you must use the alias name throughout the query instead of the original keyspace name.

In the FROM clause, the renaming appears only in the projection and not the fields themselves.

When no alias is used, the keyspace or last field name of an expression is given as the implicit alias.

When an alias conflicts with a keyspace or field name in the same scope, the identifier always refers to the alias.
This allows for consistent behavior in scenarios where an identifier only conflicts in some documents.
For more information on aliases, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[Identifiers].
====

== USE KEYS Clause

You can refer to a document's unique document key by using the `USE KEYS` clause.
Only documents having those document keys will be included as inputs to a query.

*Syntax*

Arguments::
PRIMARY;; [Optional] `USE KEYS` and `USE PRIMARY KEYS` are synonyms.

expr;; String of a document key or an array of comma-separated document keys.

*USE KEYS Example 1:* Select a single document by its document key.

== ANSI JOIN Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 5.5)_

NOTE: ANSI JOIN (and <<section_tc1_nnx_1db,ANSI NEST>>) clauses have much more flexible functionality than their earlier INDEX and LOOKUP equivalents.
Since these are standard compliant and more flexible, we recommend you to use ANSI JOIN (and ANSI NEST) exclusively, where possible.

*Purpose*

To be closer to standard SQL syntax, ANSI JOIN can join arbitrary fields of the documents and can be chained together.

The following table lists the JOIN types currently supported.

| Join Type | Remarks | Example

| *[INNER] JOIN \...

\...
then you will get covering index scan, as shown in the Visual Explain Plan:

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_AnsiJoin-Ex4-BeerVisual2.png[]

*Limitations*

The following Join types are currently not supported:

* `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` is only supported when it’s the only join in the query; or in a chain of joins, the `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` must be the first join in the chain.
* No mixing of new ANSI Join syntax with Lookup/Index Join syntax in the same FROM clause.
* The right-hand-side of any join must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand-side of a join.
* A join can only be executed when appropriate index exists on the inner side of the join.
* Adaptive indexes are not considered when selecting indexes on inner side of the join.

== ANSI JOIN Hints (HASH & NL)

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 5.5)_

Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition supports two join methods for performing ANSI Join: nested-loop join and hash join.
The default join method is nested-loop join.
Two corresponding join hints are introduced: `USE HASH` and `USE NL`.

Hash join is only considered when the `USE HASH` hint is specified, and it requires at least one equality predicate between the left-hand side and right-hand side.
In such cases, if a hash join is chosen successfully, then that’ll be the join method used for this join.
If the hash join cannot be generated, then the planner will further consider nested-loop join and will either generate a nested-loop join or return an error for the join.

If no join hint is specified or USE NL hint is specified, then nested-loop join is considered.

NOTE: For Community Edition (CE), any specified `USE HASH` hint will be silently ignored and only nested-loop join is considered by the planner.

*USE HASH hint*

The `USE HASH` hint is similar to the existing `USE INDEX` o``r USE KEYS`` hint in that the `USE HASH` hint can be specified after a keyspace reference in an ANSI Join specification.
There are two versions of the `USE HASH` hint that indicate whether the keyspace is to be used as:

* The build side of the hash join -- `USE HASH(build)`
* The probe side of the hash join -- `USE HASH(probe)`

A hash join has two sides: a `BUILD` and a `PROBE`.
The `BUILD` side of the join will be used to create an in-memory hash table.
The `PROBE` side will use that table to find matches and perform the join.
Typically, this means you want the `BUILD` side to be used on the smaller of the two sets.
However, you can only supply one hash hint, and only to the right side of the join.
So if you specify `BUILD` on the right side, then you are implicitly using `PROBE` on the left side (and vice versa).

*USE HASH Example 1:* PROBE

The keyspace `aline` is to be joined (with `rte`) using hash join, and `aline` is used as the probe side of the hash join.

----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE HASH (PROBE)
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "Total_Count": 17629
  }
]
----

*USE HASH Example 2:* BUILD

This is effectively the same query as the previous example, except the two keyspaces are switched, and here the `USE HASH(BUILD)` hint is used, indicating the hash join should use `rte` as the build side.

----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` aline
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` rte
USE HASH (BUILD)
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "Total_Count": 17629
  }
]

*USE NL hint*

This join hint instructs the planner to use nested-loop join (NL join) for the join being considered.
Since nested-loop join is the default path, the `USE NL` hint is not required.

USE NL Example:

----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE NL
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----

NOTE: The join hint for the first join should be specified on the 2nd keyspace reference, and the join hint for the second join should be specified on the 3rd keyspace reference, etc.
If a join hint is specified on the first keyspace, an error is returned.

*Multiple hints*

You can use only one join hint (USE HASH or USE NL) together with only one other hint (USE INDEX or USE KEYS) for a total of two hints.
The order of the two hints doesn't matter.

When multiple hints are being specified, use only one `USE` keyword with one following the other, as in the following examples.

*Multiple hint Example 1:* USE INDEX with USE HASH.

----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE INDEX idx1 HASH (PROBE)
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----

*Multiple hint Example 2:* USE HASH with USE KEYS.

----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE HASH (PROBE) KEYS ["airline_key1", "airline_key2", "airline_key3"]
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----

When chosen, the hash join will always work; the restrictions are on any USE KEYS hint clause:

* Must not depend on any previous keyspaces.
* The expression must be constants, host variables, etc.
* Must not contain any subqueries.

NOTE: If the USE KEYS hint contains references to other keyspaces or subqueries, then the USE HASH hint will be ignored and nested-loop join will be used instead.

== ANSI JOIN and Arrays

ANSI JOIN provides great flexibility since the `ON` clause of an ANSI JOIN can be any expression as long as it evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.
Below are different join scenarios involving arrays and ways to handle each scenario.

[NOTE]
====
These buckets and indexes will be used throughout this section's array scenarios.
As a convention, when a field name starts with `a` it is an array, so each bucket has two array fields and two regular fields.
Also, both `_idx1` indexes index each element of its array, while both `_idx2` indexes use its entire array as the index key.

`bucket b1 (a11, a12, c11, c12)`

`bucket b2 (a21, a22, c21, c22)`

`CREATE INDEX b1_idx1 ON b1 (c11, c12, DISTINCT a11)`

`CREATE INDEX b1_idx2 ON b1 (a12)`

`CREATE INDEX b2_idx1 ON b2 (c21, c22, DISTINCT a21)`

`CREATE INDEX b2_idx2 ON b2 (a22)`
====

*ANSI JOIN with no arrays*

In this scenario, there is no involvement of arrays in the join.
These are just straight-forward joins:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

Here the joins are using non-array fields of each keyspace.

The following case also falls in this scenario:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

In this example, although there is an ANY predicate on the right-hand side array `b2.a21`, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus, as far as the join is concerned, it is still a 1-to-1 join.
Similarly:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 20 END;
----

In this case the ANY predicate is on the left-hand side array `b1.a11`; however, similar to above, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus the join is still 1-to-1.
We can even have ANY predicates on both sides:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 10 END;
----

Again, the ANY predicates do not involve any join, and the join is still 1-to-1.

*ANSI JOIN with entire array as index key*

As a special case, it is possible to perform ANSI JOIN on an entire array as a join key:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.a21 = b2.a22
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

In this case, the entire array must match each other for the join to work.
For all practical purposes, the array here is treated as a scalar since there is no logic to iterate through elements of an array here.
The entire array is used as an index key (`b2_idx2`) and as such, an entire array is used as an index span to probe the index.
The join here can also be considered as 1-to-1.

*ANSI JOIN involving right-hand-side arrays*

In this scenario, the join involves an array on the right-hand side keyspace:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = b1.c12 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10;
----

In this case, the ANY predicate involves a join, and thus, effectively we are joining `b1` with elements of the `b2.a21` array.
This now becomes a 1-to-many join.
Note that we use an ANY clause for this scenario since it’s a natural extension of the existing support for array indexes; the only difference is for index span generation, we now can have a potential join expression.
Array indexes can be used for join in this scenario.

*ANSI JOIN involving left-hand-side arrays*

This is a slightly more complex scenario, where the array reference is on the left-hand side of the join, and it’s a many-to-1 join.
There are two alternative ways to handle the scenario where the array appears on the left-hand side of the join.

*Alternative #1: use UNNEST*::
This alternative will flatten the left-hand side array first, before performing the join:
+
----
SELECT *
FROM b1 UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
JOIN b2
  ON ba1 = b2.c22
  AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----
+
The <<unnest,UNNEST>> operation is used to flatten the array, turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents; and then for each one of them, join with the right-hand side.
This way, by the time join is being performed, it is a regular join, since the array is already flattened in the UNNEST step.

*Alternative #2: use IN clause*::
This alternative uses the IN clause to handle the array:
+
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c22 IN b1.a12 AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10 AND b1.c12 = 100;
----
+
By using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[IN] clause, the right-hand side field value can match any of the elements of the left-hand side array.
Conceptually, we are using each element of the left-hand side array to probe the right-hand side index.

*Differences between the two alternatives*::
There is a semantical difference between the two alternatives.
With UNNEST, we are first turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents and then performing the join.
With IN-clause, there is still only one left-hand side document, which can then join with one or more right-hand side documents.
Thus:
* If the array contains duplicate values,
 ** the UNNEST method treats each duplicate as an individual value and thus duplicated results will be returned;
 ** the IN clause method will not duplicate the result.
* If no duplicate values exists and we are performing inner join,
 ** then the two alternatives will likely give the same result.
* If outer join is performed, assuming there are N elements in the left-hand side array, and assuming there is at most one matching document from the right-hand side for each element of the array,
 ** the UNNEST method will produce N result documents;
 ** the IN clause method may produce < N result documents if some of the array elements do not have matching right-hand side documents.

*ANSI JOIN with arrays on both sides*

If the join involves arrays on both sides, then we can combine the approaches above, i.e., using ANY clause to handle the right-hand side array and either UNNEST or IN clause to handle the left-hand side array.
For example:

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
  JOIN b2
    ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = ba1 END
    AND b2.c21 = 10
    AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

or

----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v IN b1.a12 END
  AND b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

[#lookup-join-clause]
== Lookup JOIN Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

The `JOIN` clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two or more source objects.

Lookup joins allow only left-to-right joins, which means the ON KEYS expression must produce a document key which is then used to retrieve documents from the right-hand side keyspace.
Couchbase Server version 4.1 and earlier supported only lookup joins.

*Syntax*

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_lookup-join-clause.png[,70%]

----
[ join-type ] JOIN from-path [ [ AS ] alias ] ON KEYS on-keys-clause
----

Arguments::
join-type;; [Optional; default is `INNER`]
`INNER`::: For each joined object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

`LEFT OUTER`::: For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

from-path;;
[Required] Keyspace reference for right-hand side of lookup join.
For details, see <<concept_rnt_zfk_np/keyspaces,Keyspaces>>.

alias (Optionally, `AS` alias);;
[Optional] To assign another name.
For details, see <<concept_rnt_zfk_np/as,AS Keyword>>.

`ON KEYS` on-keys-clause;;
[Required] String or expression representing the primary keys of the documents for the right-hand side keyspace.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression produces one or more document keys for the right-hand side document.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression can produce an array of document keys.

Return Values::
If `LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER` is specified, then a left outer join is performed.
+
At least one joined object is produced for each left-hand source object.
+
If the right-hand source object is `NULL` or `MISSING`, then the joined object's right-hand side value is also `NULL` or `MISSING` (omitted), respectively.

Limitations:: Lookup JOINs can be chained with other lookup joins/nests or index joins/nests, but they cannot be mixed with an ANSI JOIN or ANSI NEST.

[#index-join-clause]
== Index JOIN Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

When Lookup JOINs cannot efficiently join left-hand side documents with right-to-left joins and your situation cannot be flipped because your predicate needs to be on the left-hand side (such as the above Lookup Example #1 where airline documents have no reference to route documents), then Index JOINs can be used efficiently without making a Cartesian product of all route documents.
Index JOINs allow you to flip the direction of your join clause.

Consider the below query similar to the above _Lookup Example #1_ with route and airline documents where route.airlineid is the document key of route documents and airline documents have no reference to route documents:

----
SELECT DISTINCT airline.name, airline.callsign, route.destinationairport,
 route.stops, route.airline
FROM `travel-sample` route
  JOIN `travel-sample` airline
  ON KEYS route.airlineid
WHERE route.type = "route"
AND airline.type = "airline"
AND airline.icao = "SEA"
LIMIT 4;
----

This query gets a list of Seattle (`SEA`) flights, but getting `SEA` flights cannot be efficiently executed without making a Cartesian product of all route documents (LHS) with all airline documents (RHS).

This query cannot use any index on airline to directly access SEA flights because airline is on the RHS.

Also, you cannot rewrite the query to put the airline document on the LHS (to use any index) and the route document on the RHS because the airline documents (on the LHS) have no primary keys to access the route documents (on the RHS).

Using index joins, the same query can be written as:

----
Required Index:
  CREATE INDEX route_airlineid ON `travel-sample`(airlineid) WHERE type="route";

Optional index:
  CREATE INDEX airline_icao ON `travel-sample`(icao) WHERE type="airline";

Resulting in:
  SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` airline
    JOIN `travel-sample` route
    ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline
  WHERE route.type="route"
  AND airline.type="airline"
  AND airline.icao = "SEA";
----

If you generalize the same query, it looks like the following:

----
CREATE INDEX on-key-for-index-name rhs-expression (lhs-expression-key);

SELECT projection-list
FROM lhs-expression
JOIN rhs-expression
  ON KEY rhs-expression.lhs-expression-key FOR lhs-expression
[ WHERE predicates ] ;
----

There are three important changes in the index scan syntax example above:

* `CREATE INDEX` on the `ON KEY` expression `route.airlineid` to access `route` documents using `airlineid` (which are produced on the LHS).
* The `ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline` enables N1QL to use the index `route.airlineid`.
* Create any optional index such as `route.airline` that can be used on airline (LHS).

NOTE: For index joins, the syntax uses `ON KEY` (singular) instead of `ON KEYS` (plural).
This is because Index JOINs' `ON KEY` expression must produce a scalar value; whereas Lookup JOINs' `ON KEYS` expression can produce either a scalar or an array value.

[#unnest]
== UNNEST Clause

If a document or object contains a nested array, UNNEST conceptually performs a join of the nested array with its parent object.
Each resulting joined object becomes an output of the query.
Unnests can be chained.

*Syntax*

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_unnest-clause_4.0_RR.png[,80%]

----
[ join-type ] UNNEST path [ [ AS ] alias ]
----

Arguments::
join-type;; [Optional; default is `INNER`]
`INNER`::: For each result object produced, the array object in the left-hand side keyspace must be non-empty.

`LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER`::: A left-outer unnest is performed, and at least one result object is produced for each left source object.

path;; [Required] The first path element after each UNNEST must reference some preceding path.

alias (optionally, `AS` alias);;
[Required] To assign a name for the unnested item.
For details, see <<concept_rnt_zfk_np/as,AS Keyword>>.

Return Values:: If the right-hand source object is `NULL`, `MISSING`, empty, or a non-array value, then the result object's right-side value is `MISSING` (omitted).

*UNNEST Example 1:* UNNEST an array to select an item.

In the `travel-sample` keyspace, flatten the schedule array to get a list of the flights on Monday (`1`).

----
SELECT sched
FROM `travel-sample`
UNNEST schedule sched
WHERE  sched.day = 1
LIMIT 3;
----

Results :

----
[
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF356",
      "utc": "12:40:00"
    }
  },
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF480",
      "utc": "08:58:00"
    }
  },
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF250",
      "utc": "12:59:00"
    }
  }
]
----

Another way to get similar results is by using a Collection Operator to find array items that meet our criteria:

----
SELECT ARRAY item FOR item IN schedule WHEN item.day = 1 END AS Monday_flights
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY item IN schedule SATISFIES item.day = 1 END
LIMIT 3;
----

However, without the `UNNEST` clause, the unflattened list results in 3 sets of flights instead of only 3 individual flights:

----
[
  {
    "Monday_flights": [
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF356",
        "utc": "12:40:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF480",
        "utc": "08:58:00"

      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF250",
        "utc": "12:59:00"
      },
      {

*UNNEST Example 2:* Use `UNNEST` to collect items from one array to use in another query.

In this example, the `UNNEST` clause iterates over the `reviews` array and collects the `author` names of the reviewers who rated the rooms less than a 2 to be contacted for ways to improve.
`r` is an element of the array generated by the UNNEST operation.

----
SELECT RAW r.author
FROM `travel-sample`
UNNEST reviews AS r
WHERE `travel-sample`.type = "hotel"
AND r.ratings.Rooms < 2
LIMIT 4;

== ANSI NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 5.5)_

NOTE: ANSI NEST (and <<section_ek1_jnx_1db,ANSI JOIN>>) clauses are much faster and have much more flexible functionality than their earlier INDEX and LOOKUP equivalents, so users are strongly recommended to use ANSI NEST (and ANSI JOIN) exclusively, where possible.

ANSI NEST supports more nest types than Couchbase Server version 4.0's NEST was able.
ANSI NEST can nest arbitrary fields of the documents and can be chained together.

The key difference between the currently supported nests and ANSI NEST support is the replacement of the current `ON KEYS` or `ON KEY … FOR` clauses with a simple `ON` clause.
The `ON KEYS` or `ON KEY … FOR` clauses dictate that those nests can only be done on a document key (primary key for a document).
The `ON` clause can contain any expression, and thus it opens up many more nest possibilities that Couchbase did not previously support.

*Syntax*

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_ansi-nest_RR-clause_5.5.png[,80%]

`lhs-expr` `[``nest-type``] NEST` `rhs-expr` `ON` `nest-clause`

*Arguments*

*lhs-expr*:: [Required] Keyspace reference or expression representing the left-hand side of the nest clause.

*nest-type*::
[Optional.
Default is `INNER`] String representing the type of nest.
`INNER`;;
[Optional.
Default is `INNER`]
+
For each nested object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT [OUTER]`;;
[Optional.
Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`]
+
For each nested object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`NEST` *rhs-expr*:: [Required] Keyspace reference or expression representing the right-hand side of the nest clause.

`ON` *nest-clause*:: [Required] Boolean expression representing the nest condition between the left-hand side expression and the right-hand side expression, which can be fields, constant expressions or any complex N1QL expression.

*Limitations*

The following nest types are currently not supported:

* Full OUTER NEST
* Cross NEST
* No mixing of new ANSI NEST syntax with NEST syntax in the same FROM clause.
* The right-hand-side of any nest must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand-side of a nest.
* A nest can only be executed when appropriate index exists on the inner side of the ANSI NEST (similar to current NEST support).
* Adaptive indexes are not considered when selecting indexes on inner side of the nest

*ANSI NEST Example 1:* Inner ANSI NEST

== Lookup NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

Nesting is conceptually the inverse of unnesting.
Nesting performs a join across two keyspaces.
But instead of producing a cross-product of the left and right inputs, a single result is produced for each left input, while the corresponding right inputs are collected into an array and nested as a single array-valued field in the result object.

*Syntax*

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_lookup-nest_4.0_RR.png[,80%]

----
[ join-type ] NEST from-path [ [ AS ] alias ] on-keys-clause
----

Arguments::
join-type;; [Optional; default is `INNER`]
`INNER`::: For each result object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

`LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER`:::
A left-outer unnest is performed, and at least one result object is produced for each left source object.
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

from-path;;
[Required] Keyspace reference for right-hand side of lookup nest.
For details, see <<concept_rnt_zfk_np/keyspaces,Keyspaces>>.

alias (optionally, `AS` alias);;
[Required] To assign a name for the right-hand side keyspace.
For details, see <<concept_rnt_zfk_np/as,AS Keyword>>.

on-keys-clause;;
[Required] String or expression representing the primary keys of the documents for the second keyspace.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression produces one or more document keys for the right-hand side document.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression can produce an array of document keys.

Return Values::
If the right-hand source object is NULL, MISSING, empty, or a non-array value, then the result object's right-side value is MISSING (omitted).
+
Nests can be chained with other NEST, JOIN, and UNNEST clauses.
By default, an INNER NEST is performed.
This means that for each result object produced, both the left and right source objects must be non-missing and non-null.
The right-hand side result of NEST is always an array or MISSING.
If there is no matching right source object, then the right source object is as follows:
+
|===
| If the `ON KEYS` expression evaluates to | Then the right-side value is

| `MISSING`
| `MISSING`

| `NULL`
| `MISSING`

| an array
| an empty array

| a non-array value
| an empty array
|===

*Lookup NEST Example 1:* Join two keyspaces producing an output for each left input.

[#section_rgr_rnx_1db]
== Index NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

When Lookup NESTs cannot efficiently nest left-hand side documents with right-to-left nests and your situation cannot be flipped because your predicate needs to be on the left-hand side (such as the above Lookup NEST Example #1 where airline documents have no reference to route documents), then Index NESTs can be used efficiently.
Index NESTs allow you to flip the direction of your nest clause.

*Index NEST Example 1:* List four

----
CREATE INDEX idx_ijoin ON `travel-sample`(airlineid) WHERE type="route";

SELECT *
FROM `travel-sample` rte
  INNER NEST `travel-sample` aline
  ON KEY rte.airlineid
  FOR rte
WHERE rte.type = "route"
LIMIT 4;
----

If you generalize the same query, it looks like the following:

----
CREATE INDEX on-key-for-index-name rhs-expression (lhs-expression-key);

SELECT projection-list
FROM lhs-expression
  NEST rhs-expression
  ON KEY rhs-expression.lhs-expression-key FOR lhs-expression
[ WHERE predicates ] ;
----

There are three important changes in the index scan syntax example above:

* `CREATE INDEX` on the `ON KEY` expression `route.airlineid` to access `route` documents using `airlineid` (which are produced on the LHS).
* The `ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline` enables N1QL to use the index `route.airlineid`.
* Create any optional index, such as `route.airline` that can be used on `airline` (LHS).

NOTE: For index nests, the syntax uses `ON KEY` (singular) instead of `ON KEYS` (plural).
This is because Index NESTs' `ON KEY` expression must produce a scalar value; whereas Lookup NESTs' `ON KEYS` expression can produce either a scalar or an array value.

*Syntax*

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/FROM_index-nest_5.1_rr.png[]

----
[ nest-type ] NEST from-path [ [ AS ] alias ] ON KEY on-key-clause FOR for-clause
----

*Arguments*

*nest-type*:: [Optional; default is `LEFT INNER`]
`LEFT` or `LEFT INNER`;; For each nested object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT OUTER`;; For each nested object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

from-path::
Keyspace reference for right-hand side of an index nest.
For details, see http://docs-build.sc.couchbase.com/server/2059/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/from.html#concept_rnt_zfk_np__keyspaces[[.underline]#Keyspaces#^].

`AS` alias::
[Optional] To assign another name.
For details, see http://docs-build.sc.couchbase.com/server/2059/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/from.html#concept_rnt_zfk_np__as[[.underline]#AS Keyword#^].

`ON KEY` rhs-expression.lhs-expression-key::
rhs-expression;; Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the index nest.

lhs-expression-key;; String or expression representing the attribute in `rhs-expression` referencing the document key for `lhs-expression`.

`FOR` lhs-expression:: Keyspace reference for the left-hand side of the index nest.

*Index NEST Example 1:* ON KEY \...
FOR.

This example nests the airline routes for each airline after creating the following index.
(Note that the index will not match if it contains a WHERE clause)

----
CREATE INDEX route_airline ON `travel-sample`(airlineid);

SELECT *
FROM `travel-sample` aline
  INNER NEST `travel-sample` rte
  ON KEY rte.airlineid
  FOR aline
WHERE aline.type = "airline"
