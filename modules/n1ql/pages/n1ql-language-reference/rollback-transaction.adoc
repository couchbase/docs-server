[abstract]
The `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement enables you to rollback a transaction.

== Purpose

The `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement enables you to rollback an ACID transaction.
You can rollback the entire transaction, or rollback to a previous savepoint.
Refer to {transactions}[Transactions] for further information.

This statement may only be used within a transaction.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-id.adoc[]

When you rollback the entire transaction, this statement removes all savepoints within the transaction.

NOTE: If you are using the cbq shell, and a transaction fails for any reason, you must use the `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement to remove the transaction context and reset the transaction ID.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
rollback-transaction ::= ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRAN | TRANSACTION ] [ TO SAVEPOINT __savepointname__ ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/rollback-transaction.png["'ROLLBACK' ( 'WORK' | 'TRAN' | 'TRANSACTION' )? ( 'TO' 'SAVEPOINT' savepointname )?"]

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
These keywords are optional; you may include one of these keywords, or omit them entirely.

=== Rollback to a Savepoint

The `TO SAVEPOINT` clause enables you to rollback to a specified savepoint.
This clause is optional.
If omitted, the entire transaction is rolled back.

savepointname::
An identifier specifying a name for the savepoint.
