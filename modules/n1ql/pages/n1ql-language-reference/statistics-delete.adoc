== Purpose

The `UPDATE STATISTICS` statement provides a syntax which enables you to delete statistics for a set of index expressions, or for an entire keyspace.

Since the {cbo}[cost-based optimizer] uses statistics for cost calculations, deleting statistics for a set of index expressions effectively turns off the cost-based optimizer for queries which utilize predicates on those expressions.
Deleting all statistics for a keyspace turns off the cost-based optimizer for all queries referencing that keyspace.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
update-statistics-delete ::=
  ( UPDATE STATISTICS [ FOR ] | ANALYZE [ KEYSPACE | COLLECTION ] )
    <<keyspace-ref>> <<delete-clause>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/update-statistics-delete.png["( 'UPDATE' 'STATISTICS' 'FOR'? | 'ANALYZE' ( 'KEYSPACE' | 'COLLECTION')? ) keyspace-ref delete-clause"]

For this syntax, `UPDATE STATISTICS` and `ANALYZE` are synonyms.
The statement must begin with one of these alternatives.

When using the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords, the `FOR` keyword is optional.
Including this keyword makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

When using the `ANALYZE` keyword, the `COLLECTION` or `KEYSPACE` keywords are optional.
Including either of these keywords makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

[[keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref]]
=== Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= <<keyspace-path>> | <<keyspace-partial>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-ref.png["keyspace-path | keyspace-partial"]

[#keyspace-path,reftext="keyspace-path",subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-path ::= [ {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] ':' ] {logical-hierarchy}[bucket] [ '.' {logical-hierarchy}[scope] '.' {logical-hierarchy}[collection] ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-path.png["( namespace ':' )? bucket ( '.' scope '.' collection )?"]

[#keyspace-partial,reftext="keyspace-partial",subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-partial ::= {logical-hierarchy}[collection]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-partial.png["collection"]

The simple name or fully-qualified name of the keyspace for which you want to delete statistics.
Refer to the {keyspace-ref}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

[[delete-clause,delete-clause]]
=== DELETE Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
delete-clause ::= DELETE <<delete-expressions>> | <<delete-all>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/delete-clause.png["'DELETE' ( delete-expressions | delete-all )"]

The `DELETE` clause enables you to provide a comma-separated list of index expressions for which you want to delete statistics, or to specify that you want to delete all statistics for the keyspace.

[[delete-expressions,delete-expressions]]
==== Delete Expressions

[subs="normal"]
----
delete-expressions ::= [ STATISTICS ] '(' __index-expr__ [ ',' __index-expr__ ]* ')'
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/delete-expressions.png["'STATISTICS'? '(' index-expr ( ',' index-expr )* ')'"]

If you used the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords at the beginning of the statement, you may not use the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

Conversely, if you used the `ANALYZE` keyword at the beginning of the statement, you must include the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

index-expr::
The expression for which you want to delete statistics.
This may be any expression that is supported as an index key, including, but not limited to:

* A {expression}[N1QL expression] over any fields in the document, as used in a secondary index.

* An {array-expr}[array expression], as used when creating an array index.

* An {meta-info-expr}[expression with the META() function], as used in a metadata index.

[[delete-all,delete-all]]
==== Delete All Statistics

[subs="normal"]
----
delete-all ::= ALL | STATISTICS
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/delete-all.png["'ALL' | 'STATISTICS'"]

If you used the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords at the beginning of the statement, you must use the `ALL` keyword in this clause.

Conversely, if you used the `ANALYZE` keyword at the beginning of the statement, you must use the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

== Result

The statement returns an empty array.

== Examples

[[ex-1]]
.Delete statistics with UPDATE STATISTICS
====
[source,n1ql]
----
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel
DELETE (city, country, free_breakfast);
----
====

[[ex-2]]
.Delete statistics with ANALYZE
====
[source,n1ql]
----
ANALYZE KEYSPACE `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel
DELETE STATISTICS (city, country, free_breakfast);
----

This query is equivalent to the query in <<ex-1>>.
====

[[ex-3]]
.Delete all statistics with UPDATE STATISTICS
====
[source,n1ql]
----
UPDATE STATISTICS FOR `travel-sample`.inventory.airport DELETE ALL;
----
====

[[ex-4]]
.Delete all statistics with ANALYZE
====
[source,n1ql]
----
ANALYZE KEYSPACE `travel-sample`.inventory.airport DELETE STATISTICS;
----

This query is equivalent to the query in <<ex-3>>.
