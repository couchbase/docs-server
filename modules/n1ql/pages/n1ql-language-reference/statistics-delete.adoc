== Purpose

The `UPDATE STATISTICS` statement provides a syntax which enables you to delete statistics for a set of index expressions, or for an entire keyspace.

Since the {cbo}[cost-based optimizer] uses statistics for cost calculations, deleting statistics for a set of index expressions effectively turns off the cost-based optimizer for queries which utilize predicates on those expressions.
Deleting all statistics for a keyspace turns off the cost-based optimizer for all queries referencing that keyspace.

== Syntax

For this syntax, `UPDATE STATISTICS` and `ANALYZE` are synonyms.
The statement must begin with one of these alternatives.

When using the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords, the `FOR` keyword is optional.
Including this keyword makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

When using the `ANALYZE` keyword, the `COLLECTION` or `KEYSPACE` keywords are optional.
Including either of these keywords makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

The simple name or fully-qualified name of the keyspace for which you want to delete statistics.
Refer to the {keyspace-ref}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

[[delete-clause]]
=== DELETE Clause

[source,ebnf]

The `DELETE` clause enables you to provide a comma-separated list of index expressions for which you want to delete statistics, or to specify that you want to delete all statistics for the keyspace.

==== Delete Expressions

Constraint: if you used the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords at the beginning of the statement, you may not use the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

Conversely, if you used the `ANALYZE` keyword at the beginning of the statement, you must include the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

[horizontal]
index-key::
[Required] The expression for which you want to delete statistics.
This may be any expression that is supported as an index key, including, but not limited to:

* A {expression}[N1QL expression] over any fields in the document, as used in a secondary index.

* An {array-expr}[array expression], as used when creating an array index.

* An {meta-info-expr}[expression with the META() function], as used in a metadata index.

[[delete-all]]
==== Delete All Statistics

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/utility.ebnf[tag=delete-all]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/delete-all.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Constraint: If you used the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords at the beginning of the statement, you must use the `ALL` keyword in this clause.

Conversely, if you used the `ANALYZE` keyword at the beginning of the statement, you must use the `STATISTICS` keyword in this clause.

== Result

The statement returns an empty array.
