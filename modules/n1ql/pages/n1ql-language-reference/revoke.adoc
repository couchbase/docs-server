= REVOKE

[abstract]
The REVOKE statement allows revoking of any RBAC roles from specific users.

Roles can be of the following two types:

[#table_idr_mz2_p1b,cols="100,733"]
|===
| *simple*
| Roles which apply generically to all buckets/resources in the cluster.

For example: `ClusterAdmin` or `BucketAdmin`

| *parameterized by a bucket*
| Roles which are defined for the scope of the specified bucket only.
The bucket name is specified after ON.

For example: `pass:c[BucketReader ON `travel-sample`]`

or `pass:c[Query_Select ON `travel-sample`]`
|===

NOTE: Only Full Administrators can run the REVOKE statement.
For more details about user roles, see xref:security:security-authorization.adoc#authorization[Authorization].

*Syntax*

----
REVOKE role1 [, role2, ...]
    ON bucket1 [, bucket2, ...]
  FROM user1 [, user2, ...]
----

*role*:: `RBAC-role[(bucket_name)]`
+
`RBAC-role` is one of the xref:security:security-authorization.adoc#authorization[RBAC role names predefined] by Couchbase Server.
+
`RBAC-user` is the user name created by the Couchbase Server RBAC system.
+
The following roles have short forms that can be used as well:
[#ul_htw_dgf_nbb]
* `query_select → select`
* `query_insert → insert`
* `query_update → update`
* `query_delete → delete`

*bucket*:: The name of your Couchbase or Memcached bucket or buckets.

*user*:: `RBAC-user` in your bucket.

*Example 1*: Revoke the role of ClusterAdmin from three people.
