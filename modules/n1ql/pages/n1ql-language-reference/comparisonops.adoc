The following tables describe each comparison operator and its return values.

|===
| Operator | Description | Returns

| =
| Equal to.
Functionally equivalent to == for compatibility with other languages.
| TRUE or FALSE

| ==
| Equal to.
Functionally equivalent to = for compatibility with other languages.
| TRUE or FALSE

| !=
| Not equal to.
Functionally equivalent to <> for compatibility with other languages.
| TRUE or FALSE

| <>
| Not equal to.
Functionally equivalent to != for compatibility with other languages.
| TRUE or FALSE

| >
| Greater than.
| TRUE or FALSE

| >=
| Greater than or equal to.
| TRUE or FALSE

| <
| Less than.
| TRUE or FALSE

| \<=
| Less than or equal to.
| TRUE or FALSE

== BETWEEN

[cols="100,326,213"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Returns

| BETWEEN
| Search criteria for a query where the value is between two values, including the end values specified in the range.
Values can be numbers, text, or dates.
| TRUE or FALSE

| NOT BETWEEN
| Search criteria for a query where the value is outside the range of two values, including the end values specified in the range.
Values can be numbers, text, or dates.
| TRUE or FALSE

== LIKE

image::n1ql-language-reference/like-expr.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[cols="100,326,213"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Returns

| LIKE
| Match string with a wildcard expression.
Use % for zero or more wildcards and _ to match any character at this place in a string.

The wildcard characters can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash (\).
Backslash itself can also be escaped by preceding it with another backslash.
| TRUE or FALSE

| NOT LIKE
| Inverse of LIKE.
Return TRUE if string is not similar to given string.
| TRUE or FALSE
|===

== IS

The IS family of operators lets you specify conditions based on the existence (or absence) of attributes in a data set.

[cols="100,326,213"]
|===
| Operator | Description | Returns

| IS NULL
| Field has value of NULL.
| TRUE or FALSE

| IS NOT NULL
| Field has value or is missing.
| TRUE or FALSE

| IS MISSING
| No value for field found.
| TRUE or FALSE

| IS NOT MISSING
| Value for field found or value is NULL.
| TRUE or FALSE

| IS VALUED
| Value for field found.
Value is neither missing nor NULL
| TRUE or FALSE

| IS NOT VALUED
| Value for field not found.
Value is NULL.
| TRUE or FALSE

== Comparison of Data Types

=== Strings

String comparison is done using a raw-byte collation of UTF-8 encoded strings -- sometimes referred to as binary, C, or memcmp.
This collation is case sensitive.
Case-insensitive comparisons can be performed using the UPPER() or LOWER() functions.
See xref:n1ql-language-reference/stringfun.adoc[String Functions] for more information.

=== Arrays and Objects

Arrays are compared element-wise.
Objects are first compared by length; objects of equal length are compared pairwise, with the pairs sorted by name.

=== NULL and MISSING

Except when using the IS family of operators, comparison of the MISSING or NULL data types produces the following results.

* If either operand in a comparison is MISSING, the result is MISSING.
* If either operand in a comparison is NULL, the result is NULL.
* If either operand is MISSING or NULL, the result is MISSING or NULL.
