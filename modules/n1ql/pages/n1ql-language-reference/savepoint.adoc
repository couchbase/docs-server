== Purpose

The `SAVEPOINT` statement enables you to set a savepoint within an ACID transaction.

For more information on N1QL support for Couchbase transactions, see {transactions}[].

For a walkthrough of how to use the `SET TRANSACTION` statement, see {walkthrough}[].

This statement may only be used within a transaction.

<.> After rolling back to the second savepoint, the booking document again has user `"0"`, name `"Keon Hoppe"`.
