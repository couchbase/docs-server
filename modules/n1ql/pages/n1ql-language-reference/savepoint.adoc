[abstract]
The `SAVEPOINT` statement enables you to set a savepoint within a transaction.

== Purpose

The `SAVEPOINT` statement enables you to set a savepoint within an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[Transactions] for further information.

This statement may only be used within a transaction.

If you are using the Query Workbench or the Query REST API, you must set the {txid}[txid] query parameter to specify the transaction ID.

If you are using the cbq shell, you don't need to specify the transaction ID.
Once you have started a transaction, all eligible statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
savepoint ::= SAVEPOINT __savepointname__
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/savepoint.png["'SAVEPOINT' savepointname"]

savepointname::
An identifier specifying a name for the savepoint.

If a savepoint with the same name already exists, the existing savepoint is replaced.

== Examples

[[ex-1]]
.Set a savepoint -- cbq shell
====
.Request
[source,console]
----
cbq> \SET -txid "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51"; -- <.>
cbq> SAVEPOINT s1;
----

<.> The transaction ID generated when the transaction began.
====

[[ex-2]]
.Set a savepoint -- REST API
====
.CURL request
[source,console]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8093/query/service \
-u Administrator:password \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "statement": "SAVEPOINT s1;",
  "pretty": true,
  "txid": "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51"
}'
----

This is equivalent to the request in <<ex-1>>.
