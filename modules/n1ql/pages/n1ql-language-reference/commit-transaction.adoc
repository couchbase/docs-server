[abstract]
The `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement enables you to commit a transaction.

== Purpose

The `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement enables you to commit an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[Transactions] for further information.

You must set the {txid}[txid] query parameter to specify the transaction that you want to commit.

This statement removes all savepoints within the transaction.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
commit-transaction ::= COMMIT [ WORK | TRAN | TRANSACTION ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/commit-transaction.png["'COMMIT' ( 'WORK' | 'TRAN' | 'TRANSACTION' )?"]

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
These keywords are optional; you may include one of these keywords, or omit them entirely.

== Examples

[[ex-1]]
.Commit a transaction -- cbq shell
====
.Request
[source,console]
----
cbq> \SET -txid "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51"; -- <.>
cbq> COMMIT TRANSACTION;
----

<.> The transaction ID generated when the transaction began.
====

[[ex-2]]
.Commit a transaction -- REST API
====
.CURL request
[source,console]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8093/query/service \
-u Administrator:password \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "statement": "COMMIT TRANSACTION",
  "pretty": true,
  "txid": "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51"
}'
----

This is equivalent to the request in <<ex-1>>.
