[abstract]
The `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement enables you to commit a transaction.

== Purpose

The `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement enables you to commit an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[N1QL Support for Couchbase Transactions] for further information.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-id.adoc[]

This statement removes all savepoints within the transaction.

NOTE: If you are using the cbq shell, and a transaction fails for any reason, you must use the `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement to remove the transaction context and reset the transaction ID.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
commit-transaction ::= COMMIT [ WORK | TRAN | TRANSACTION ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/commit-transaction.png["'COMMIT' ( 'WORK' | 'TRAN' | 'TRANSACTION' )?"]

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
These keywords are optional; you may include one of these keywords, or omit them entirely.

== Usage

The transaction can only be committed if the transactional {durability}[durability] requirements can be met.
The transaction durability level is set by the request-level {durability_level}[durability_level] parameter.

If transaction durability requirements cannot be met, then a 161 error code is generated when you attempt to commit the transaction, with the message "Durability requirements are impossible to achieve".
For example: bucket replication is specified, but there are not enough Data nodes available on which to store the specified number of replicas at the requested durability level.

To avoid this error, add the required number of Data nodes for the required durability level and rebalance; or {edit-bucket}[turn off bucket replication].

<.> Set a savepoint.
<.> Update the specified documents in the `test` keyspace to include a second attribute `b`.
<.> Set a second savepoint.
<.> Update the specified documents in the `test` keyspace to include a third attribute named `c`.
<.> Roll back the transaction to the second savepoint.
<.> Commit the transaction.

<.> Before setting the second savepoint, the `abc2` document has two attributes: `a` and `b`.
<.> After setting the second savepoint and performing an update, the `abc2` document has three attributes: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
<.> After rolling back to the second savepoint, the `abc2` document again has only two attributes: `a` and `b`.
