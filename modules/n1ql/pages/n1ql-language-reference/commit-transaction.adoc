== Purpose

The `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement enables you to commit an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[N1QL Support for Couchbase Transactions] for further information.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-id.adoc[]

This statement removes all savepoints within the transaction.

NOTE: If you are using the cbq shell, and a transaction fails for any reason, you must use the `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement to remove the transaction context and reset the transaction ID.

== Syntax

[source,ebnf]

image::n1ql-language-reference/commit-transaction.png[align=left]

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
These keywords are optional; you may include one of these keywords, or omit them entirely.

== Usage

The transaction can only be committed if the transactional {durability}[durability] requirements can be met.
The transaction durability level is set by the request-level {durability_level}[durability_level] parameter.

If transaction durability requirements cannot be met, then a 161 error code is generated when you attempt to commit the transaction, with the message "Durability requirements are impossible to achieve".
For example: bucket replication is specified, but there are not enough Data nodes available on which to store the specified number of replicas at the requested durability level.

To avoid this error, it is recommended that you add the correct number of Data nodes for the required durability level, and rebalance.
As a temporary measure, you can set the request-level {durability_level}[durability_level] parameter to `"none"` to turn off durability for this request, or {edit-bucket}[turn off bucket replication].

== Examples

If you want to try these examples, first refer to {preparation}[Preparation] to set up your environment.
