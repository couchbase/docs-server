== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=create-collection]

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-collection.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket in which you want to create the collection.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket in which you want to create the collection.

scope::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the scope in which you want to create the collection.

collection::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the collection that you want to create.
Refer to {naming-for-scopes-and-collections}[Naming for Scopes and Collections] for restrictions on collection names.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name, the scope name, or the collection name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

[[location]]
=== Specifying the Location

To specify the location of the collection, you may do one of the following:

* Include its [def]_full path_, containing the namespace, bucket, and scope, followed by the collection name;
* Include a [def]_relative path_, containing just the bucket and scope, followed by the connection name;
* Specify just the collection name without a path.

When you specify a collection name without a path, you must set the {query-context}[query context] to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.
If you specify a collection name by itself without setting a valid query context, an error is generated.

[[if-not-exists]]
=== IF NOT EXISTS Clause

The optional `IF NOT EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully when the specified collection already exists.
If a collection with the same name already exists within the specified scope, then:

* If this clause is not present, an error is generated.

* If this clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Usage

It is important to note that the scope must exist before you can create the collection, whether the scope is specified in the statement itself or implied by the query context.
If the scope does not exist, an error is generated.
You cannot create the scope and the collection in a single statement.

== Examples

.Create collection with full path
====
This statement creates a collection called `city` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,sqlpp]
----
CREATE COLLECTION `travel-sample`.inventory.city
----
====

[discrete]
===== Query Context

For the following example, you must first set the {query-context}[query context] to `{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory`, using the Query Workbench or the cbq shell.

[{tabs}]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
Use the query context drop-down menu to select `travel-sample.inventory`.

image::tools:query-workbench-context.png["The query context drop-down menu, with 'travel-sample.inventory' selected"]
--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -query_context travel-sample.inventory;
----
--
====

.Create collection with query context
====
Assuming that the query context is set, this statement creates a collection called `country` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,sqlpp]
----
CREATE COLLECTION country;
----
====
