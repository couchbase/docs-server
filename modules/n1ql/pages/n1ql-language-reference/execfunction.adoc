The `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement enables you to execute a user-defined function.

== Purpose

The `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement enables you to execute a user-defined function.
It is useful for testing user-defined functions outside the context of a query.

You cannot use the `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement to execute a built-in N1QL function.
If you do this, error `10101: Function not found` is generated.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
execute-function ::= EXECUTE FUNCTION <<name,name>> '(' [ <<expression,expression>> ( ',' <<expression,expression>> )* ] ')'

[[name]]
name::
The name of the function.
This may be an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`, or a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must execute the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

[[expression]]
expression::
[Optional] A N1QL expression required by the function as an argument.
If the function was created with named parameters, you must supply all the arguments that were specified when the function was created.
If the function was created without named parameters, it is variadic, and you can supply as many arguments as needed.
