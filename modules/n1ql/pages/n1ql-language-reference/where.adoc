== Arguments

cond:: [Required] Conditional expression that represents a filter to be applied to the resultset.
Records for which the condition resolves to TRUE are propagated to the resultset.

You can construct complex conditional expressions, for example by using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[logical operators] `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
