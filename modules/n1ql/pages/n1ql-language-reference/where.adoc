== Purpose

When you want to narrow down your resultset by one or more criteria, use the `WHERE` clause to filter your resultset.

For example, list airports in France, detailed in <<examples_section,Example 1>>:

----
SELECT airportname, city, country
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport
WHERE country = "France"
LIMIT 4;
----

== Syntax

----
where-clause ::= WHERE cond
----

== Arguments

cond:: [Required] Conditional expression that represents a filter to be applied to the resultset.
Records for which the condition resolves to TRUE are propagated to the resultset.

You can construct complex conditional expressions, for example by using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[logical operators] `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
