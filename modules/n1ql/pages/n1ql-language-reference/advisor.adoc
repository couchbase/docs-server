{description}
One is to invoke the index advisor _immediately_ for a given query or set of queries; the other is to start a session in which every query of interest is collected for a set time period, then invoke the index advisor _asynchronously_ for that collection of queries when the session ends.
Within these two scenarios, this function has several different usages.
The operation and output of each usage depends on the function's single argument.
For clarity, each usage is listed separately on this page.

include::ROOT:partial$developer-preview.adoc[tag=admonition]

[[advisor-string]]
== ADVISOR(`string`)

=== Description

When used with a string argument, the function invokes the index advisor for a single N1QL query.
The index advisor works with {select}[SELECT], {update}[UPDATE], {delete}[DELETE], or {merge}[MERGE] queries.

=== Arguments

string::
A string, or an expression which resolves to a string, containing a single N1QL query.

=== Return Value

Returns an index advisor results object with the following properties.

[[results]]
**Results**

|Name|Description|Schema

|**current_used_indexes** +

|< <<indexes,Indexes>> > array

|**recommended_covering_indexes** +

=== Example

.Get index advice for a single query
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT ADVISOR("SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'") AS Single;
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "Single": {
      "current_used_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX def_type ON `travel-sample`(`type`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX def_city ON `travel-sample`(`city`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_city_type ON `travel-sample`(`city`) WHERE `type` = 'hotel'",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

Only one statement occurs in these results, because the function was called with a single query input.
In this case, the index advisor identifies two indexes which are currently used by the query, and recommends one secondary index.
No covering indexes are recommended.
====

[[advisor-array]]
== ADVISOR(`array`)

=== Description

When used with an array argument, the function invokes the index advisor for multiple N1QL queries.
The index advisor works with {select}[SELECT], {update}[UPDATE], {delete}[DELETE], or {merge}[MERGE] queries.

=== Arguments

array::
An array of strings, or an expression which resolves to an array of strings, each of which contains a N1QL query.

=== Return Value

Returns an <<results,index advisor results>> object.

=== Examples

.Get index advice for multiple queries
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT ADVISOR(["SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'", "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` h JOIN `travel-sample` a ON a.city = h.city WHERE h.type = 'hotel' AND a.type = 'airport'"]) AS Multiple;

.Result

[
  {
    "Multiple": {
      "current_used_indexes": [
        {

          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            },
            ...
          ]
        },
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX def_type ON `travel-sample`(`type`)",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            },
            ...
          ]
        }
      ],
      "recommended_indexes": [
        {
          "index": "CREATE INDEX adv_city_type ON `travel-sample`(`city`) WHERE `type` = 'hotel'",
          "statements": [
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'hotel' AND city = 'Paris'"
            },
            {
              "run_count": 1,
              "statement": "SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` h JOIN `travel-sample` a ON a.city = h.city WHERE h.type = 'hotel' AND a.type = 'airport'"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

In this case, the index advisor recommends an index which would be suitable for both of the input queries.

====

[[advisor-session-start]]
== ADVISOR(`start_obj`)

=== Description

When used with a `start_obj` object argument, the function can be used to start an index advisor session.
As long as the session is running, any queries that meet the criteria you specify are collected for later analysis.

By default, the session continues running for the duration you specify when you start the session.
At the end of the duration, the index advisor analyzes any queries that have been collected by this session.
The session and any resulting index advice are retained in the _tasks cache_.
You can then <<advisor-session-get,get the results>> for this session to see the index advice.

=== Arguments

start_obj::
An object with the following properties:

action;;
[Required] The string `start`.

profile;;
[Optional] A string specifying the user profile whose queries you want to collect.
If omitted, all queries are collected.

response;;
[Optional] A string representing a duration.
All completed queries lasting longer than this threshold are collected for analysis by the index advisor.
Valid time units are `ns` (nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours).
If omitted, the default setting is `0s`.

duration;;
[Required] A string representing a duration.
The index advisor session runs for the length of this duration.
Valid time units are `ns` (nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), or `h` (hours).

query-count;;
[Optional] An integer specifying the maximum number of queries to be collected for analysis by the index advisor.
If omitted, the default setting is the same as the service-level {completed-limit}[completed-limit] setting.
You can change the service-level `completed-limit` setting to change the default for this property.

=== Return Value

Returns an object with the following property:

[options="header", cols="3a,11a,4a"]
|===
|Name|Description|Schema

|**session** +
__required__
|The name of the index advisor session.
You will need to refer to this name to <<advisor-session-get,get the results>> for this session, or to <<advisor-session-stop,stop>>, <<advisor-session-abort,abort>>, or <<advisor-session-purge,purge>> this session.
