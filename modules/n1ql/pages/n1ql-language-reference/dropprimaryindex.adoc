{description}

IMPORTANT: Named primary indexes that are created using CREATE PRIMARY INDEX, can only be dropped using the DROP INDEX command.

_drop-primary-index:_

----
DROP PRIMARY INDEX ON named_keyspace_ref [USING GSI];
----

_named-keyspace-ref(expression[,expression]*)_

----
[ namespace-name :] keyspace-name
----

_keyspace-name:_

identifier that refers to the bucket name.
Specifies the bucket as source for which the index needs to be created.
You can add an optional namespace name to the keyspace name in this way:

_namespace-name : keyspace-name_

Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

_USING GSI_

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, the index type for a primary index must be Global Secondary Index (GSI).
The `USING GSI` keywords are optional and may be omitted.

*RBAC Privileges*

User executing the DROP PRIMARY INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace/bucket.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

== Example

The following example creates a primary index on the beer-sample bucket.
Once the index creation statement comes back, system:indexes is queried for status of the index.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `beer-sample` USING GSI;
SELECT * FROM system:indexes;
----

Subsequently, the unnamed primary index is dropped with the following statement and it no longer is reported in the system:indexes output.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP PRIMARY INDEX ON `beer-sample` USING GSI;
SELECT * FROM system:indexes;
----
