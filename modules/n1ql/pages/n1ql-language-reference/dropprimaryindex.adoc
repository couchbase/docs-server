= DROP PRIMARY INDEX

The DROP PRIMARY INDEX statement allows you to drop an unnamed primary indexes.

IMPORTANT: Named primary indexes that are created using CREATE PRIMARY INDEX, can only be dropped using the DROP INDEX command.

_ 	drop-primary-index: _

----
DROP PRIMARY INDEX ON named_keyspace_ref [USING GSI|VIEW];
----

_ 	named-keyspace-ref(expression[,expression]*) _

----
[ namespace-name :] keyspace-name
----

_keyspace-name:_

identifier that refers to the bucket name.
Specifies the bucket as source for which the index needs to be created.
You can add an optional namespace name to the keyspace name in this way:

_ namespace-name : keyspace-name _

For example, main:customer indicates the customer keyspace in the main namespace.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

_USING GSI | VIEW_

USING clause specify the index type to use.
Indexes can be created using GSI or views.
If USING clause is not specified, by default GSI is used as the indexer.

*RBAC Privileges*

User executing the DROP PRIMARY INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace/bucket.

== Example

The following example creates a primary index on the beer-sample bucket.
Once the index creation statement comes back, system:indexes is queried for status of the index.

----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `beer-sample` USING GSI;
SELECT * FROM system:indexes;
----

Subsequently, the unnamed primary index is dropped with the following statement and it no longer is reported in the system:indexes output.

----
DROP PRIMARY INDEX ON `beer-sample` USING GSI;
SELECT * FROM system:indexes;
----
