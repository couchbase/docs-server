[abstract]
The ADVISE statement provides index recommendations to optimize query response time.

include::ROOT:partial$enterprise-preview.adoc[tag=admonition]

== Purpose

The ADVISE statement invokes the _index advisor_ to provide index recommendations for a single query.
You can use the ADVISE statement with any of the following types of query:

* {select}[SELECT] queries
* {update}[UPDATE] queries
* {delete}[DELETE] queries
* {merge}[MERGE] queries

The index advisor can recommend regular secondary indexes, partial indexes, and array indexes for the following predicates and conditions:

* Predicates in the WHERE clause
* Join conditions in the ON clause for INDEX JOIN, ANSI JOIN, ANSI NEST, INDEX NEST, and ANSI MERGE operations
* Predicates of elements in an UNNEST array
* Predicates with the ANY expression
* Predicates of subqueries in the FROM clause

The index advisor also suggests covering indexes and covering array indexes for queries in a single keyspace, including JOIN operations, ANY expressions, and UNNEST predicates.

The index advisor checks the indexes currently used by the query.
If the query is already using the recommended indexes, the index advisor informs you, and does not recommend an index unnecessarily.
Similarly, if the query is already using the optimal covering index, the index advisor informs you, and does not recommend a covering index.

== Prerequisites

To execute the ADVISE statement, you must have the privileges required for the N1QL statement for which you want advice.
For more details about user roles, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
advise-index ::= ADVISE [ INDEX ] ( {select}[select] | {update}[update] | {delete}[delete] | {merge}[merge] )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/advise-index.png["'ADVISE' 'INDEX'? ( select | update | delete | merge )"]

The statement consists of the `ADVISE` keyword, and optionally the `INDEX` keyword, followed by the query for which you want index advice.

== Usage

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/advice-workbench.adoc[]

[[recommendation-rules]]
=== Recommendation Rules

The index advisor recommends secondary indexes based on the query predicate, according to the following rules.
The rules are listed below in priority order.
Within each recommended index, if there is more than one index key, they are sorted according to the priority order of these rules.

[options="header", cols="30a,35a,35a"]
|===
|Rule
|Description
|Recommendation

|[start=1]
. Leading array index for UNNEST
|The query uses a predicate which applies to individual elements in an unnested array.

Example: `UNNEST schedule AS x WHERE x.day = 1`
|An {array-index}[array index], where the leading index key is an array expression indexing all elements in the unnested array.

|[start=2]
. Equality / NULL / MISSING
|The query has a predicate with an {comparisonops}[equality], {comparisonops}[IS NULL], or {comparisonops}[IS MISSING] expression.

Example: `WHERE id = 10`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=3]
. IN predicates
|The query has a predicate with an {collection-op-in}[IN] expression.

Example: `WHERE id IN [10, 20]`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=4]
. Not less than / between / not greater than
|The query has a predicate with a {comparisonops}[+<=+], {comparisonops}[BETWEEN], or {comparisonops}[+>=+] expression.

Example: `WHERE id >= 10`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=5]
. Less than / between / greater than
|The query has a predicate with a {comparisonops}[<], {comparisonops}[BETWEEN], or {comparisonops}[>] expression.

Example: `WHERE id BETWEEN 10 AND 25`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=6]
. Array predicate
|The query has a predicate with an {collection-op-any}[ANY] expression.

Example: `WHERE ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.utc > "19:00" END`
|An {array-index}[array index], where the index key is an array expression recursively indexing all elements referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=7]
. Derived join filter as leading key
|The query has a {join}[join] using an ON clause which filters on the left-hand side keyspace.

Example: `FROM {backtick}travel-sample{backtick} r JOIN {backtick}travel-sample{backtick} a ON r.airlineid = META(a).id`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where the leading index key is the field from the left-hand side keyspace in the ON clause.

|[start=8]
. IS NOT NULL / MISSING / VALUED predicates
|The query has a predicate with {comparisonops}[IS NOT NULL], {comparisonops}[IS NOT MISSING], or {comparisonops}[IS NOT VALUED].

Example: `WHERE id IS NOT NULL`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=9]
. Functional predicates
|The query contains an indexable function.

Example: `WHERE LOWER(name) = "john"`
|A {functional-index}[functional index], where the index key contains the function referenced by the predicate expression.

|[start=10]
. Non-static join predicate
|The query has a {join}[join] using an ON clause in which neither the left-hand side source object nor the right-hand side source object is static.

Example: `FROM {backtick}travel-sample{backtick} r JOIN {backtick}travel-sample{backtick} a ON r.airline = a.iata`
|A {secondary-index}[secondary index], where one index key is the field from the right-hand side keyspace in the ON clause.

|[start=11]
. Flavor for partial index
|The query includes filters on a particular {schema-output}[flavor] of document.

Example: `WHERE type = "hotel"`
|A {partial-index}[partial index] for that flavor of document.
|===

=== Index Names

The index advisor suggests a name for each index it recommends, starting with `adv_`, followed by the `DISTINCT` or `ALL` keyword for array indexes if applicable, and including the names of the fields referenced in the index definition, separated by underscores -- for example, `adv_city_type_name`.
Some field names may be truncated if they are too long.

NOTE: The names that the index advisor suggests are not guaranteed to be unique.
You should check the suggested index names and change any that are duplicates.
