= UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT
:description: pass:q[The `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` operators combine the resultsets of two or more `SELECT` statements.]

[abstract]
{description}

*Syntax*

----
SELECT query1 UNION query2
|
SELECT query1 INTERSECT query2
|
SELECT query1 EXCEPT query2
----

Arguments::
`UNION`;; Returns all values from both the first and second `SELECT` statements.

`INTERSECT`;; Returns only values present in both the first and second `SELECT` statements.

`EXCEPT`;; Returns values from the first `SELECT` statement that are absent from the second `SELECT` statement.

query1, query2;; Strings or expressions that represent valid `SELECT` statements.

Return Values::
`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` return distinct results, such that there are no duplicates.
+
`UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT ALL`, and `EXCEPT ALL` return all applicable values, including duplicates.
These queries are faster, because they do not compute distinct results.

You can improve the performance of a query by using covering indexes, where the index includes all the information needed to satisfy the query.
For more information, see xref:indexes:covering-indexes.adoc[Covering Indexes].

*Examples*

For the following examples, consider these queries and results.

----
Q1: SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport";      (1641 results)

Q2: SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "hotel";        (274 results)
----

*Example 1: UNION of Q1 and Q2.*

----
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport"
UNION SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "hotel";
----

This gives 1871 results:

----
[
  {
    "city": "Calais"
  },
  {
    "city": "Peronne"
  },
  {
    "city": "Nangis"
  },
  {
    "city": "Bagnole-de-l'orne"
  },
...
----

*Example 2: INTERSECT of Q1 and Q2.*

----
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport"
INTERSECT SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "hotel";
----

This gives 44 results:

----
[
  {
    "city": "Cannes"
  },
  {
    "city": "Nice"
  },
  {
    "city": "Orange"
  },
  {
    "city": "Avignon"
  },
...
----

*Example 3: EXCEPT of Q1 and Q2.*

----
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport"
EXCEPT SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "hotel";
----

This gives 1597 results:

----
[
  {
    "city": "Calais"
  },
  {
    "city": "Peronne"
  },
  {
    "city": "Nangis"
  },
  {
    "city": "Bagnole-de-l'orne"
  },
...
----

*Example 4: EXCEPT of Q2 and Q1.*

----
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "hotel"
UNION SELECT DISTINCT city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = "airport";
----

This gives 230 results:

----
[
  {
    "city": "Medway"
  },
  {
    "city": "Gillingham"
  },
  {
    "city": "Giverny"
  },
  {
    "city": "Highland"
  },
...
