== Type-Checking Functions

ISARRAY(expression)

Returns True if expression is an array, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

ISATOM(expression)

Returns True if expression is a Boolean, number, or string, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

ISBOOLEAN(expression)

Returns True if expression is a Boolean, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

ISNUMBER(expression)

Returns True if expression is a number, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

ISOBJECT(expression)

Returns True if expression is an object, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

ISSTRING(expression)

Returns True if expression is a string, otherwise returns MISSING, NULL or false.

TYPE(expression)

Returns one of the following strings, based on the value of expression:

* "missing"
* "null"
* "boolean"
* "number"
* "string"
* "array"
* "object"
* "binary"

== Type-Conversion Functions

TOARRAY(expression)

Returns array as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* Arrays are themselves.
* All other values are wrapped in an array.

TOATOM(expression)

Returns atomic value as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* Arrays of length 1 are the result of TOATOM() on their single element.
* Objects of length 1 are the result of TOATOM() on their single value.
* Booleans, numbers, and strings are themselves.
* All other values are NULL.

TOBOOLEAN(expression)

Returns Boolean as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* False is false.
* Numbers +0, -0, and NaN are false.
* Empty strings, arrays, and objects are false.
* All other values are true.

TONUMBER(expression)

Returns number as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* False is 0.
* True is 1.
* Numbers are themselves.
* Strings that parse as numbers are those numbers.
* All other values are NULL.

TOOBJECT(expression)

Returns object as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* Objects are themselves.
* All other values are the empty object.

TOSTRING(expression)

Returns string as follows:

* MISSING is MISSING.
* NULL is NULL.
* False is "false".
* True is "true".
* Numbers are their string representation.
* Strings are themselves.
* All other values are NULL.
