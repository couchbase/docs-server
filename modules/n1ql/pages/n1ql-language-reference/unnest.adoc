= UNNEST clause
:description: pass:q[The `UNNEST` clause creates an input object by flattening an array in the parent document.]

:clause: UNNEST

[abstract]
{description}

== Purpose

The `UNNEST` clause is used within the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause.
If a document or object contains a nested array, UNNEST conceptually performs a join of the nested array with its parent object.
Each resulting joined object becomes an output of the query.
Unnests can be chained.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
unnest-clause ::= <<from-term,from-term>> [ <<unnest-type,unnest-type>> ] ( UNNEST | FLATTEN ) <<unnest-path,expr>> [ [ AS ] <<unnest-as-alias,alias>> ]
----

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/from-term.adoc[]

[#unnest-type]
=== Unnest Type

[subs="normal"]
----
unnest-type ::= INNER | ( LEFT [ OUTER ] )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/unnest-type.png[]

This clause represents the type of unnest.

`INNER`::
For each result object produced, the array object in the left-hand side keyspace must be non-empty.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`{endsb}
+
A left-outer unnest is performed, and at least one result object is produced for each left source object.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default is `INNER`.

[#unnest-path]
=== Unnest Path

expr:: The path to the nested array.

The path expression in each UNNEST clause must reference some preceding path.

[#unnest-as-alias]
=== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the right-hand side of the unnest.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the path is optional.
If you assign an alias to the path, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[NOTE]
--
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, if you want to use an xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[ARRAY index] for the UNNEST query, you can use any arbitrary alias for the right side of the UNNEST -- the alias does not have to be the same as the ARRAY index variable name in order to use that index.

== Examples

[#UNNEST-Example-1]
.UNNEST an array to select an item
====
In the `travel-sample` keyspace, flatten the schedule array to get a list of the flights on Monday (`1`).

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT sched
FROM `travel-sample`
UNNEST schedule sched
WHERE  sched.day = 1
LIMIT 3;
----

.Results
[source,JSON]
----
[
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF356",
      "utc": "12:40:00"
    }
  },
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF480",
      "utc": "08:58:00"
    }
  },
  {
    "sched": {
      "day": 1,
      "flight": "AF250",
      "utc": "12:59:00"
    }
  }
]
----

Another way to get similar results is by using a Collection Operator to find array items that meet our criteria:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT ARRAY item FOR item IN schedule WHEN item.day = 1 END AS Monday_flights
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY item IN schedule SATISFIES item.day = 1 END
LIMIT 3;
----

However, without the `UNNEST` clause, the unflattened list results in 3 sets of flights instead of only 3 individual flights:

[source,JSON]
----
[
  {
    "Monday_flights": [
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF356",
        "utc": "12:40:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF480",
        "utc": "08:58:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF250",
        "utc": "12:59:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF130",
        "utc": "04:45:00"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "Monday_flights": [
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF517",
        "utc": "13:36:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF279",
        "utc": "21:35:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF753",
        "utc": "00:54:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF079",
        "utc": "15:29:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF756",
        "utc": "06:16:00"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "Monday_flights": [
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF975",
        "utc": "11:23:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 1,
        "flight": "AF225",
        "utc": "16:05:00"
      }
    ]
  }

[#UNNEST-Example-2]
.Use `UNNEST` to collect items from one array to use in another query
====
In this example, the `UNNEST` clause iterates over the `reviews` array and collects the `author` names of the reviewers who rated the rooms less than a 2 to be contacted for ways to improve.
`r` is an element of the array generated by the UNNEST operation.

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT RAW r.author
FROM `travel-sample`
UNNEST reviews AS r
WHERE `travel-sample`.type = "hotel"
AND r.ratings.Rooms < 2
LIMIT 4;
----

.Results
[source,JSON]
----
[
  "Kayli Cronin",
  "Shanelle Streich",
  "Catharine Funk",
  "Tyson Beatty"
]
