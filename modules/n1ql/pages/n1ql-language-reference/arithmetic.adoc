= Arithmetic Operators
:description: Arithmetic operations perform the basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo within an expression or any numerical value retrieved as part of query clauses.

{description}
Additionally, N1QL provides a negation operation which changes the sign of a value.

[NOTE]
====
These arithmetic operators only operate on numbers.
In N1QL, arithmetic operators have their usual meaning.
However, in any of these expressions:

* If any operand is MISSING, the value of the expression is MISSING.
* If any operand is NULL and no operand is MISSING, the value of the expression is NULL.
* If any operand is not a number, the operator evaluates to NULL.

|===
| Operator | Description

| +
| Add values.

| -
| Subtract right value from left value.

| *
| Multiply values.

| /
| Divide left value by right value.

| %
| Modulo.
Divide left value by right value and return the remainder.

NOTE: Modulo is an integer operator and will use only the integer part of each value.

| -[.var]`value`
| Negate value.

== Syntax

There are six different arithmetic syntaxes:

----
expr1 + expr2

expr1 - expr2

expr1 * expr2

expr1 / expr2

expr1 % expr2

-expr1
----

== Arguments

expr1, expr2:: Number or an expression that results in a number value.

Return Values:: A number, representing the value of the arithmetic operation.

== Examples

*Example 1*: Select the longest flight and return its two airports and the distance in feet.

----
SELECT sourceairport, destinationairport, ROUND(distance) AS DistanceInMiles,
       ROUND(distance)*5280 AS DistanceInFeet
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type="route"
ORDER BY distance DESC
LIMIT 1;

Returns:
[
  {
    "DistanceInFeet": 72906240,
    "DistanceInMiles": 13808,
    "destinationairport": "DFW",
    "sourceairport": "SYD"
  }
]
----

*Example 2*: Select the modulo of 5 and 3 and compare to the modulo of 5.4 and 3.4.

----
SELECT 5 % 3;

Returns:
[
  {
    "$1": 2
  }
]


SELECT 5.4 % 3.4;

Returns:
[
  {
    "$1": 2
  }
]
