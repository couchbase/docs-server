{description}

== Purpose

When you want the resultset to skip over the first few resulting objects, use the `OFFSET` clause to specify that number of objects to ignore.

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are evaluated after the `ORDER BY` clause.

If a `LIMIT` clause is also present, the `OFFSET` is applied prior to the `LIMIT`; that is, the specified number of objects is omitted from the result set before enforcing a specified `LIMIT`.

(((pagination)))
You can use the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` clauses together to [def]_paginate_ the results -- that is, to split the resultset into pages, each containing a specified number of documents, for display purposes.

.Paginate the results using OFFSET and LIMIT
====
The following query uses named parameters and expressions to display the specified page of results, assuming that page numbering starts at zero.

Setting the page number to zero, with two results per page, the results are as follows.
