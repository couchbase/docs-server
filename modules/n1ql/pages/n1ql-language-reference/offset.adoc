= OFFSET clause

----
OFFSET expression
----

The OFFSET clause specifies a number of objects to be skipped.
If a LIMIT clause is also present, the OFFSET is applied prior to the LIMIT.
The OFFSET value must be a non-negative integer.

The OFFSET clause optionally follows the LIMIT clause.
If an offset is specified, the specified number of objects is omitted from the result set before enforcing a specified LIMIT.
This clause must be a non-negative integer.

Examples
