= OFFSET clause

[abstract]
The `OFFSET` clause specifies the number of resultset objects to skip in a `SELECT` query.

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

[#section_srj_3jy_2cb]
== Purpose

When you want the resultset to skip over the first few resulting objects, use the `OFFSET` clause to specify that number of objects to ignore.

If a `LIMIT` clause is also present, the `OFFSET` is applied prior to the `LIMIT`; that is, the specified number of objects is omitted from the result set before enforcing a specified `LIMIT`.
