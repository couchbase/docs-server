{description}

A query hint is a type of xref:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[optimizer hint].
Currently {sqlpp} supports only one query block hint: ORDERED.

There are two possible formats for each optimizer hint: simple syntax and JSON syntax.
Note that you cannot mix simple syntax and JSON syntax in the same hint comment.

== ORDERED

If present, this hint directs the optimizer to order any joins just as they are ordered in the query.
If not specified, the optimizer determines the optimal join order.

=== Simple Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/hints.ebnf[tag=ordered-hint-simple]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ordered-hint-simple.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

With the simple syntax, this hint takes no arguments.
You may only use this hint once within the hint comment.

=== JSON Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/hints.ebnf[tag=ordered-hint-json]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ordered-hint-json.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

With the JSON syntax, this hint takes the form of an `ordered` property.
You may only use this property once within the hint comment.
The value of this property must be set to `true`.

=== Examples

{cbo-preamble}

[#ex-ordered-simple]
.ORDERED hint -- simple syntax
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/ordered-hint.n1ql[tag=simple]
----

<1> Join the `airport` keyspace to the `route` keyspace.
<2> Join the resulting dataset to the `airline` keyspace.
====

[#ex-ordered-json]
.ORDERED hint -- JSON syntax
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/ordered-hint.n1ql[tag=json]
----

<1> Join the `airport` keyspace to the `route` keyspace.
<2> Join the resulting dataset to the `airline` keyspace.

If you examine the plan for this query, or the query in the previous example, you can see that the joins are ordered just as they were written.

[discrete]
<1> Join the `airport` keyspace to the `route` keyspace.
<2> Join the resulting dataset to the `airline` keyspace.
====

[#ex-ordered-opt]
.Optimized join ordering
====
For further insight into join enumeration, consider the following query, which is equivalent to the previous two examples, but without the ORDERED hint.

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/ordered-hint.n1ql[tag=none]
----

<1> Join the `airport` keyspace to the `route` keyspace.
<2> Join the resulting dataset to the `airline` keyspace.

If you examine the plan for this query, you can see that because there is no hint, the optimizer has re-ordered the joins.

image::join-order-optimize.png["Query plan with optimized join order"]

[discrete]
<1> Join the `airline` keyspace to the `route` keyspace.
<2> Join the resulting dataset to the `airport` keyspace.
====

=== Legacy Equivalent

There is no legacy clause equivalent to this hint.
