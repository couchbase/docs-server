:description: Query block hints are hints that apply to an entire query block.

[abstract]
{description}

Currently N1QL supports only one query block hint: ORDERED.

There are two possible formats for each optimizer hint: simple syntax and JSON syntax.
Note that you cannot mix simple syntax and JSON syntax in the same hint comment.

== ORDERED

If present, this hint directs the optimizer to order any joins just as they are ordered in the query.
If not specified, the optimizer determines the optimal join order.

=== Simple Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/hints.ebnf[tag=ordered-hint-simple]
----

With the simple syntax, this hint takes no arguments.
You may only use this hint once within the hint comment.

=== JSON Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/hints.ebnf[tag=ordered-hint-json]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ordered-hint-json.png[align=left]

With the JSON syntax, this hint takes the form of an `ordered` property.
You may only use this property once within the hint comment.
The value of this property must be set to `true`.

=== Examples

====
.ORDERED hint -- simple syntax
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT /*+ ORDERED */ *
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS rte
JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airport AS apt
  ON rte.destinationairport = apt.faa
NEST `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark AS lmk
  ON apt.city = lmk.city
LIMIT 5;

.ORDERED hint -- JSON syntax
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT /*+ {"ordered": true} */ *
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS rte
JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airport AS apt
  ON rte.destinationairport = apt.faa
NEST `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark AS lmk
  ON apt.city = lmk.city
LIMIT 5;
