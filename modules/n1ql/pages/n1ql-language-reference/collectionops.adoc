= Collection Operators
:description: Collection operators enable you to evaluate expressions over every element in an array.
:page-topic-type: concept
:page-toclevels: 2
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

{description}
The operators include <<range-cond>>, <<range-xform>>, <<membership>>, and <<existential>>.

NOTE: Although collection operators can be used with any array, they are particularly useful when used to evaluate expressions over a nested array of objects.
The term _collection_ is used here in a generic sense to refer to any array of objects, rather than in the specific sense of a xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Couchbase collection].

[[range-cond]]
== Range Predicates

Range predicates (<<collection-op-any>>, <<collection-op-every>>, or <<any-and-every>>) enable you to test a Boolean condition over elements in an array.
They use the `IN` and `WITHIN` operators to range through the array.

(((range condition)))
(((quantified expression)))
Range predicates may also be known as _range conditions_ or _quantified expressions_.

[discrete]
=== Arguments

name-var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents the position of a single element in an array, counting from 0.

var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents a single element in an array.

expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns an array to evaluate.

cond:: A condition to evaluate for each specified element.
This condition may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

[#collection-op-any]
=== ANY

`ANY` tests whether any element in an array matches a specified condition.
(The array must contain at least one element.)

Synonym: `SOME` is a synonym for `ANY`.

==== Return Values

If the array is non-empty and at least one element in the array matches the specified condition, then the operator returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.

[[range-xform]]
== Range Transformations

Range transformations (<<array>>, <<first>>, and <<object>>) enable you to map and filter elements and attributes from an input array.
They use the `IN` and `WITHIN` operators to range through the array.

[discrete]
=== Arguments

name-expr:: [Objects only] An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to a string, to use as the name of an attribute in the output.
This expression may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

var-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns a value to include in the output.
This expression may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

name-var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents the position of a single element in an array, counting from 0.

var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents a single element in an array.

expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns an array to evaluate.

cond:: [Optional] A condition to evaluate for each specified element.
This condition may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

[[array]]
=== ARRAY

The `ARRAY` operator returns a new array of values, mapped and filtered from a specified input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns a new array, in which each element is the output of the operand expression for one element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns an empty array.

==== Examples

[[ArrayEx1a]]
.ARRAY A
====
List only the arrays of Friday night flights from Albuquerque to Atlanta after 7pm.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT ARRAY v FOR v IN schedule WHEN v.utc > "19:00" AND v.day = 5 END AS fri_evening_flights
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE airline="KL"
  AND sourceairport="ABQ"
  AND destinationairport="ATL"
  AND ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.utc > "19:00" END;
----

This results in:

      }
    ]
  }
]
----

  AND destinationairport="ATL"
  AND ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.utc > "19:00" END;
----
====

[[ArrayEx1c]]
.ARRAY C
====
Generate a new array from an input array.
This example uses the `name-var` argument to return just the first two elements in the input array.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT ARRAY v FOR i:v IN ["a", "b", "c", "d"] WHEN i < 2 END AS new_array;
----

----
====

[[first]]
=== FIRST

The `FIRST` operator returns a single value, mapped and filtered from a specified input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns the output of the operand expression for the first element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns MISSING.

==== Examples

[[FirstEx]]
.FIRST
====
List the first array of flights from Albuquerque to Atlanta after 7pm.

----
SELECT FIRST v FOR v IN schedule WHEN v.utc > "19:00" END AS evening_flights

      }
    ]
  }
]
----
====

[[object]]
=== OBJECT

The `OBJECT` operator creates an object, in which the value of each attribute is mapped and filtered from an element in the input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns an object, which contains one attribute for each element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

The value of each attribute in the output object is the output of the `var-expr` argument for one element in the input array.

The name of each attribute in the output object is specified by the `name-expr` argument.
This argument must be an expression that generates a unique name string for every value in the output object.
If the expression does not generate a unique name string for each value, then only the last attribute is output; all previous attributes are suppressed.

In order to generate a unique name string for every value, the expression that you use for the `name-expr` argument may reference the `var` argument or the `name-var` argument.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns an empty object.

==== Examples

[[ObjectExA]]
.OBJECT A
====
Generate an object from an input array.
This example uses the UUID() function to generate a unique name for each attribute in the output object.

[[existential]]
== Existential Tests

Existential tests enable you to test whether an array contains any elements.
There is one existential test: <<exists>>.

[[exists]]
=== EXISTS

The `EXISTS` operator enables you to test whether an array has any elements, or is empty.

This operator may be used in a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement in combination with a subquery.
The condition is met if the subquery returns at least one result.

==== Arguments

expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns an array.

==== Return Values

If the expression is an array which contains at least one element, the operator evaluates to `TRUE`; otherwise, it evaluates to `FALSE`.

==== Examples

[[ExistsEx]]
.EXISTS
====
Of the 274 cities with a hotel, search for all cities that have hotels with reviews.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT h.city
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel AS h

[[membership]]
== Membership Tests

Membership tests (<<collection-op-in>> and <<collection-op-within>>) enable you to test whether a value exists within an array.

Membership tests are efficient over arrays with a large number of elements -- up to approximately 8000.

[#collection-op-in]
=== IN

The `IN` operator specifies the search depth to include only the current level of an array, and not to include any child or descendant arrays.

==== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=in-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/in-expr.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

==== Arguments

earch-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns the value to search for.

target-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to the array to search through.

==== Return Values

The `IN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and directly contains the left-side value.

The `NOT IN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and does not directly contain the left-side value.

==== Examples

[[InExA]]
.IN A
====
Search for all airlines from the United Kingdom or France.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline AS t

      "callsign": "CORSAIR",
      "country": "France",
      "iata": "SS",
      "icao": "CRL",

[[InExB]]
.IN B
====
Search for the author "Walton Wolf" in the hotel documents.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel AS t WHERE "Walton Wolf" IN t;
----

This results in an empty set because authors are not in the current level (the root level) of the `travel-sample` documents.

[source,json]
----
[]
----

The authors are listed inside the `reviews` array (a child element) and would need the `WITHIN` keyword to search all child elements along with the root level.
====

[#collection-op-within]
=== WITHIN

The `WITHIN` operator specifies the search depth to include the current level of an array, and all of its child and descendant arrays.

==== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=within-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/within-expr.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

==== Arguments

search-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns the value to search for.

target-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to the array to search through.

==== Return Values

The `WITHIN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and contains the left-side value as a child or descendant, that is, directly or indirectly.

The `NOT WITHIN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and no child or descendant contains the left-side value.

==== Examples

[[WithinEx]]
.WITHIN
====
Search all elements for the author "Walton Wolf" in the hotel documents.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel AS t WHERE "Walton Wolf" WITHIN t;
----

This results in 1 document since his name appears inside the `reviews` array.

On arrival were were told that the travel agent booked us a king bed and not a double room as we requested when booking and made sure it was a double, as 2 blokes. the guy on reception was not moving on it, he said there will be a double room available on the tuesday, this was sunday when we came. he also advised us that it will be an extra 20 dollars per night in the double room. in fairness we were not impressed with his attitude and inflexibility. nothing we could do so we jst grinned and beared it. then to make things worse, our room was in the basement, beside the breakfeast room and the ice machines and vending machines. Pure pissed off afer paying 500euro each for this $@!#%. The room was serioulsy small, no room for our suitcases, a major squash round the king bed. pure noisy the following morning frm the machines outside our room, this should not be a room it should be a storage room, so not impressed. After one night in that room we asked the girl on reception if ther is any chance we could change room to a double, she checked and said yes, one is available and they are jst cleaning it and after that we can change room. Obviously the guy on reception the day b4 jst cudnt be bothered informing us of this. After we chaged rooms it was fine, room was ok for ny, not alot of space to move about, have stayed in better ones in ny. had no problem after we changed rooms, the girl on reception was very nice and helpful, she let me do check my online banking on her pc and let us use the phone when we neede to, at no cost, she couldnt be more nice. Love ny, done all the usual haunts and sites, grand location, great italian restaurant a few mins walk away, great food, and u get a discount when u mention u are staying in the gem hotel, the girl on reception gave us a card for the restaruant. What more can i say, the hotel was fine after the inital ignorance, our stay was more pleasant chatting away to the nice girl on reception, whos name i cant remember lol, long culry dark hair ha ha.",

          "content": "SUMMARY - Although the GEM Hotel is associated with the Choice Hotels chain (Quality, Comfort, Econo, etc.) this is the first time I've heard of this particular branding. They are billed as a \"Botique Hotel\" and certainly fit the bill as much as a chain can be considered a \"Botique\". The place is very bare bones and minimal, yet very stylish and modern. They just give you the very basics of what you need and not much else, but the price reflects that. So it's hard to complain. There are 10 floors and approximately 4 small rooms/floor. It's not the kind of place I'd spend a whole week because it's rather small, has limited storage, and very few of the \"extras\" you'd need for an extended stay. But for staying a night or two in NYC when you just need a place to sleep and shower it does just fine. I forgot to take photos this time, but as of today the photos the hotel has provided on various travel websites are fairly accurate. You just have to take a close look at them to see how small the space really is and understand that the photos really show the WHOLE room. There's not much cropped out! BATHROOM: Clean, basic, and modern. It was pretty much a standard hotel sized bathroom, even though the main room was small. BEDS: Two double beds. Very comfortable, leaning towards the soft side of hotel beds. Sheets were clean and more modern/stylish than you'd find in most chain hotels. BILLING: Reserved via choicehotels.com only a few days ahead of time. The front desk had no problems getting us checked in, and the taxes/surcharges only added up to another 16% of the cost of the room itself. BREAKFAST: There is free coffee/tea in the room, but i never looked for a continental breakfast. There were vending machines in the basement with the ice/water machine. CLEANING: The room was as clean as it gets. While the building is obviously old, it seems that the entire interior is brand new. CLIMATE CONTROL: There was a brand new heater/air conditioning unit that was very quiet and easily adjustable. ELEVATORS: One main, new looking elevator in the lobby. It worked just fine and was fairly large. FRONT DESK: The front desk was helpful and competent. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a room to be cleaned. They may have had the smallest, most basic lobby i've ever seen in my life. But if you're looking for water fountains and gold trim you're not going to get it in a hotel with sub-$200 rates! GYM: None. HOT TUB: None. INTERNET: Didn't try it. I was too busy enjoying the city. LOCATION: On the west-side on 36th very close to the corner of 10th. It's a much more sparsely populated and quiet area than most of Manhattan, as it borders on more of an industrial zone. However, it's only a few blocks to Times Square, Penn Station, and Madison Square Garden. It's a block from the entrace to the Lincoln Tunnel. It was nice to be so close to everything, yet just off the \"beaten path\" in a calmer area. There's a gas station on the corner (one of the few in Manhattan) and a few other random bodegas and restaurants nearby. NOISE: It's NYC, there's always going to be some noise, but there was nothing excessive. Lots of trucks roll down 10th avenue at night, but they mostly just blended into the background. PARKING: None. It's best to find a park & ride outside the city and take a train in. Penn Station is just 2 short blocks and then 2 long blocks away. POOL: None. RECREATION: None. RESTAURANT: None, but it's New York. I'm sure you can find something to eat. For the less adventurous, I did notice a McDonald's on 10th, just a short walk from the hotel. ROOM: The room was small and there wasn't much room around the beds. I'll admit, for 3 people, it was a bit cramped. If you like your space I'd limit occupancy to 2 or find another, bigger, hotel. There was limited storage, just one small wardrobe with 2 drawers underneath, a small nightstand, alarm clock/ipod player, desk, desk chair, and flat screen TV. Again, the decor was very modern. SHUTTLE: None. STORE: None on site, a gas station on the corner, several bodegas nearby. SUPPLIES: Standard Soap, Shampoo, Conditioner, Mouthwash & Towels. ===== ===== ===== RATING NOTE: My ratings are generally based on value vs money. Thus, sometimes a simple hotel will receive a 4 or 5, while a fancy hotel can rank a 1 or 2 if I don't feel it was worth the cost. Also, a hotel can do everything right and still only rank as a 4, unless there's something really exceptional about it. 5 = Hotel gets everything right, and goes above and beyond. 4 = Hotel gets everything right. 3 = Hotel is acceptable value for money spent. 2 = Hotel isn't worth the money spent. 1 = Hotel should pay ME to stay there.",
