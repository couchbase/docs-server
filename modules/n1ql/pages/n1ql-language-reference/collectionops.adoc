= Collection Operators
:description: Collection operators enable you to evaluate expressions over every element in an array.
:page-topic-type: reference
:page-toclevels: 2
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images
:keywords: range condition, quantified expression

{description}
The operators include <<range-cond>>, <<range-xform>>, and <<membership-and-existence-tests>>.

NOTE: Although collection operators can be used with any array, they are particularly useful when used to evaluate expressions over an array of objects.
The term _collection_ is used here in a generic sense to refer to any array of objects, rather than in the specific sense of a xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Couchbase collection].

[[range-cond]]
== Range Predicates

Range predicates (<<collection-op-any>>, <<collection-op-every>>, or <<any-and-every>>) enable you to test a Boolean condition over elements in an array.
They use the `IN` and `WITHIN` operators to range through the array.

(((range condition)))
(((quantified expression)))
Range predicates may also be known as _range conditions_ or _quantified expressions_.

==== Arguments

name-var:: [Optional] An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents the position of a single element in an array, counting from 0.

var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents a single element in an array.

expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns an array to evaluate.

cond:: A condition to evaluate for each specified element.
This condition may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

[#collection-op-any]
=== ANY

`ANY` tests whether any element in an array matches a specified condition.
(If the array is empty, then no element in the array is deemed to match the condition.)

Synonym: `SOME` is a synonym for `ANY`.

==== Return Values

If the array is non-empty and at least one element in the array matches the specified condition, then the operator returns `TRUE`; otherwise, it returns `FALSE`.

==== Examples

[[AnyExA]]
.ANY with one matching element

==== Arguments

name-expr:: [`OBJECT` only] An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to a string, to use as the name of an attribute in the output.
This expression may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

var-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns a value to include in the output.
This expression may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

name-var:: [Optional] An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents the position of a single element in an array, counting from 0.

var:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that represents a single element in an array.

expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns an array to evaluate.

cond:: [Optional] A condition to evaluate for each specified element.
This condition may make use of the `var` and `name-var` identifiers as required.

[#array]
=== ARRAY

The `ARRAY` operator generates a new array, using values in the input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns a new array, which contains one element for each element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

The value of each element in the output array is the output of the `var-expr` argument for one element in the input array.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns an empty array.

==== Examples

[[ArrayEx1a]]

Refer to <<ObjectExB>> for another example with position variables.
====

[#first]
=== FIRST

The `FIRST` operator generates a new value, using a single value in the input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns the output of the `var-expr` argument for the first element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns MISSING.

==== Examples

[[FirstEx]]
.FIRST
====
List the first KL flight from Albuquerque to Atlanta after 7pm.

[source,n1ql]
----

  }
]
----

Compare this with the results of <<ArrayEx1a>> and <<ObjectExA>>.
====

[#object]
=== OBJECT

The `OBJECT` operator generates a new object, using values in the input array.

==== Return Values

The operator returns an object, which contains one attribute for each element in the input array.
If the `WHEN` clause is specified, only elements in the input array which satisfy the `WHEN` clause are considered.

The value of each attribute in the output object is the output of the `var-expr` argument for one element in the input array.

The name of each attribute in the output object is specified by the `name-expr` argument.
This argument must be an expression that generates a unique name string for every value in the output object.
If the expression does not generate a string, then the current attribute is not output.
If the expression does not generate a unique name string for each value, then only the last attribute is output; all previous attributes are suppressed.

The `name-expr` argument may reference the `var` argument or the `name-var` argument, or use any other expression that generates a unique value.

If the input array is empty, or no elements in the input array satisfy the `WHEN` clause, the operator returns an empty object.

==== Examples

[[ObjectExA]]
.OBJECT with array of objects
====
List the details of KL flights from Albuquerque to Atlanta on Fridays.
This example uses the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc#uuid[UUID()] function to generate a unique name for each attribute in the output object.

[source,n1ql]
----

[[ObjectExB]]
.OBJECT with position variable
====
An alternative version of <<ObjectExA>>.
This example uses the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/typefun.adoc#tostring[TOSTRING()] function and the position variable `i` to generate a unique name for each attribute in the output object.

[source,n1ql]
----

[[membership-and-existence-tests,Membership and Existence Tests]]
== Membership and Existence

Membership tests (<<collection-op-in>> and <<collection-op-within>>) enable you to test whether a value exists within an array.
Membership tests are efficient over arrays with a large number of elements -- up to approximately 8000.

Existence tests enable you to test whether an array contains any elements at all.
There is one existence test: <<exists>>.

[#collection-op-in]
=== IN

The `IN` operator specifies the search depth to include only the current level of an array, and not to include any child or descendant arrays.

==== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=in-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/in-expr.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

==== Arguments

earch-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that returns the value to search for.

target-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to the array to search through.

==== Return Values

The `IN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and directly contains the left-side value.

The `NOT IN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and does not directly contain the left-side value.

==== Examples

[[InExA]]
.IN with simple array

----

The authors are listed inside the `reviews` array (a child element) and would need the `WITHIN` keyword to search all child elements along with the root level.
====

[#collection-op-within]
=== WITHIN

The `WITHIN` operator specifies the search depth to include the current level of an array, and all of its child and descendant arrays.

==== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=within-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/within-expr.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

==== Arguments

target-expr:: An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[expression] that resolves to the array to search through.

==== Return Values

The `WITHIN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and contains the left-side value as a child or descendant, that is, directly or indirectly.

The `NOT WITHIN` operator evaluates to `TRUE` if the right-side value is an array and no child or descendant contains the left-side value.

==== Examples

[[WithinEx]]
.WITHIN
====
Search all elements for the author "Walton Wolf" in the hotel documents.
