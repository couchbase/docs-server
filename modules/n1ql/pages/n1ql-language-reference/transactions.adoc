[abstract]
N1QL offers full support for Couchbase ACID transactions.

Starting with Couchbase Server 7.0, N1QL offers full support for Couchbase ACID transactions based on optimistic concurrency.
Refer to {transactions}[Transactions] for an overview of Couchbase transactions.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-restrictions.adoc[]

== Statements

N1QL provides the following statements in support of Couchbase transactions.
Refer to the documentation for each statement for more information and examples.

* To begin a transaction, refer to {begin-transaction}[BEGIN TRANSACTION].
* To specify transaction settings, refer to {set-transaction}[SET TRANSACTION].
* To set a savepoint, refer to {savepoint}[SAVEPOINT].
* To rollback a transaction, refer to {rollback-transaction}[ROLLBACK TRANSACTION].
* To commit a transaction, refer to {commit-transaction}[COMMIT TRANSACTION].

== Settings and Parameters

The Query service provides settings and parameters in support of Couchbase transactions.
Refer to the documentation for each parameter for more information and examples.

* The {txid}[txid] request-level parameter specifies the transaction to which a statement belongs.

* The {tximplicit}[tximplicit] request-level parameter specifies that a statement is a single transaction.

* The {txstmtnum}[txstmtnum] request-level parameter specifies the transaction statement number.

* The {kvtimeout}[kvtimeout] request-level parameter specifies the maximum time to spend on a KV operation within a transaction before timing out.

* The {txtimeout_req}[txtimeout] request-level parameter, {txtimeout-srv}[txtimeout] node-level setting, and {queryTxTimeout}[queryTxTimeout] cluster-level setting specify the maximum time to spend on a transaction before timing out.

* The {atrcollection_req}[atrcollection] request-level parameter and {atrcollection-srv}[atrcollection] node-level setting specify where the active transaction record is stored.

* The {cleanupclientattempts}[cleanupclientattempts] and {cleanuplostattempts}[cleanuplostattempts] node-level settings and the {queryCleanupClientAttempts}[queryCleanupClientAttempts] and {queryCleanupLostAttempts}[queryCleanupLostAttempts] cluster-level settings specify how expired transactions are cleaned up.

* The {cleanupwindow}[cleanupwindow] node-level setting and {queryCleanupWindow}[queryCleanupWindow] cluster-level setting specify how frequently active transaction records are checked for cleanup.

* The {numatrs_req}[numatrs] request-level parameter, {numatrs-srv}[numatrs] node-level setting, and {queryNumAtrs}[queryNumAtrs] cluster-level setting specify the total number of active transaction records.

In addition, the {scan_consistency}[scan-consistency] request-level parameter is used to specify the transactional scan consistency.
Refer to {transactional-scan-consistency}[Transactional Scan Consistency] for details.

== Query Tools

To create a Couchbase transaction using N1QL, you can use any of the tools that you use to run a N1QL query: the {query-workbench}[Query Workbench], the {cbq-shell}[cbq shell], or the {n1ql-rest-api}[Query REST API].
There are slight differences in the way these tools operate when creating Couchbase transactions.
These are explained below.

When using the Query Workbench, you can specify parameters for the Couchbase transaction using the query run-time preferences window.

* If you are creating the Couchbase transaction one statement at a time, then once you have started the transaction, you must set the `txid` parameter to specify the transaction to which each subsequent statement belongs.

* Alternatively, you can use the btn:[Run as Transaction] button to run a single statement as a transaction, or a complete set of statements as a transaction all at once.
In this case, you do not need to specify the `txid` parameter.

When using the cbq shell, you can specify parameters for the Couchbase transaction using the `\SET` command.

* If you are creating the Couchbase transaction one statement at a time, you don't need to set the `txid` parameter.
Once you have started a transaction, all statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.
footnote:[You must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above to use the automatic transaction ID functionality.]

* Alternatively, you can use the `tximplicit` parameter to run a single statement as a transaction.
In this case, you do not need to specify the `txid` parameter either.

When using the Query REST API, you can specify parameters for the Couchbase transaction as body parameters or query parameters alongside the query statement.

* If you are creating the Couchbase transaction one statement at a time, then once you have started the transaction, you must set the `txid` parameter to specify the transaction to which each subsequent statement belongs.
* Alternatively, you can use the `tximplicit` parameter to run a single statement as a transaction.
In this case, you do not need to specify the `txid` parameter.

== Monitoring

You can monitor active Couchbase transactions using the `system:transactions` catalog.
For more information, refer to {sys-transactions}[system:transactions].

== Worked Example

This worked example guides you through a complete Couchbase transaction session using the {cbq-shell}[cbq shell].
Note that you must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above.

[[preparation]]
=== Preparation

. Start the cbq shell and connect to the Couchbase cluster.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cbq -e http://localhost:8091 -u Administrator -p password
----

. For the purposes of this worked example, create a temporary keyspace called `test`.
+
For example, if you have already installed the `travel-sample` bucket, create a scope called `transaction` within that bucket, and then create a collection called `test` within that scope. Note that "transaction" is a reserved N1QL keyword, so the name of the `transaction` scope must be delimited with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> CREATE SCOPE `travel-sample`.`transaction`;
cbq> CREATE COLLECTION `travel-sample`.`transaction`.test;
----

. Create a primary index on the `test` keyspace, so that you can query and update the documents in this keyspace.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`.`transaction`.test;
----

. Set the default query context for the following statements, assuming that you have created the `test` collection within the `pass:c[`travel-sample`.`transaction`]` scope.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> \set -query_context `travel-sample`.`transaction`;
----

. If necessary, make sure the transaction timeout is set to a reasonably long duration, so that the transaction will not time out as you work through this worked example.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> \set -txtimeout "30m";
----

=== Transaction

. Start the transaction.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> BEGIN WORK;
----
+
Notice the statement returns a transaction ID.
Since you are using the cbq shell, all statements within this session are assumed to be part of this transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.
+
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "txid": "6dfa9dd6-303f-4adc-a99f-e05a44485c45"
    }
]
----

. Create a document in the `test` keyspace with the ID `abc2`, containing a single attribute `a`.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> INSERT INTO test VALUES("abc2", {"a":1});
----

. Set a savepoint:
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SAVEPOINT s1;
----

. Update the specified documents in the `test` keyspace to include a second attribute `b`.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> UPDATE test AS d SET d.b = 10 WHERE d.a > 0;
----

. Check the content of the specified documents in the `test` keyspace.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SELECT d.*, META(d).id FROM test AS d WHERE d.a >= 0;
----
+
Notice the `abc2` document now has two attributes: `a` and `b`.
+
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 10,
        "id": "abc2"
    }
]
----

. Set a second savepoint.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SAVEPOINT s2;
----

. Update the specified documents in the `test` keyspace to include a third attribute named `c`.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> UPDATE test AS d SET d.b = 10, d.c = "xyz" WHERE d.a > 0;
----

. Check the content of the specified documents in the `test` keyspace.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SELECT d.*, META(d).id FROM test AS d WHERE d.a >= 0;
----
+
Notice the `abc2` document now has three attributes: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
+
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 10,
        "c": "xyz",
        "id": "abc2"
    }
]
----

. Roll back the transaction to the second savepoint.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> ROLLBACK TRAN TO SAVEPOINT s2;
----

. Check the content of the specified documents in the `test` keyspace again.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SELECT d.*, META(d).id FROM test AS d WHERE d.a >= 0;
----
+
Notice the `abc2` document again has only two attributes: `a` and `b`.
+
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "a": 1,
        "b": 10,
        "id": "abc2"
    }
]
----

. Roll back the entire transaction.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> ROLLBACK WORK;
----

. Check the content of the specified documents in the `test` keyspace again.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> SELECT d.*, META(d).id FROM test AS d WHERE d.a >= 0;
----
+
Notice the `abc2` document no longer exists.

=== Finishing Off

. You can now exit the cbq shell.
+
[source,shell]
----
cbq> \quit;
----
