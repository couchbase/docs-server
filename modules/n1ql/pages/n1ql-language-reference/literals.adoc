= Literals

[abstract]
Literal values include strings, numbers, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, and MISSING.

N1QL supports the same literals as JSON, as defined by http://json.org/[json.org^], with these exceptions:

* In N1QL, "true", "false," and "null" are case-insensitive to be consistent with other N1QL keywords.
In standard JSON, "true", "false," and "null" are case-sensitive.
* "missing" is added as a literal expression, although it is not returned in final results.
Missing is omitted from objects, and is converted to null in result arrays.
* In N1QL single and double quotation marks can be used for strings.
JSON supports only double quotation marks.

Wherever a value is expected, either of two special values may appear: NULL (denoting an out-of-band value that is not comparable to any other value), and MISSING (denoting the absence of a value).
Every value also has a "truth" value, these truth value conversions are explained in xref:n1ql-language-reference/booleanlogic.adoc[Boolean Logic].

The following query returns emails from contacts where the contact name is ‘dave’.

.Query:
[source,sql]
----
SELECT email
FROM contacts
AS contact
WHERE contact.name = 'dave'
----

.Result:
[source,json]
----
{"email": "dave@gmail.com"}
----

== Booleans

----
TRUE | FALSE
----

Boolean propositions evaluate to TRUE and FALSE.
These values are case-insensitive.

== Numbers

----
[-] [ digits] [fraction] [exponent]
----

Fraction:

----
. digits
----

Exponent:

----
e | E  [ + | - ]  digits
----

Numbers can be either signed or unsigned digits with an optional fractional component and an optional exponent.
The numbers should not start with a zero.

== Strings

----
"  characters  "
----

Strings can be either Unicode characters or escaped characters.

.Characters:
----
