[abstract]
Literal values include strings, numbers, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, and MISSING.

N1QL supports the same literals as JSON, as defined by http://json.org/[json.org^], with these exceptions:

* In N1QL, "true", "false," and "null" are case-insensitive to be consistent with other N1QL keywords.
In standard JSON, "true", "false," and "null" are case-sensitive.
* "missing" is added as a literal expression, although it is not returned in final results.
Missing is omitted from objects, and is converted to null in result arrays.
* In N1QL single and double quotation marks can be used for strings.
JSON supports only double quotation marks.

Wherever a value is expected, either of two special values may appear: NULL (denoting an out-of-band value that is not comparable to any other value), and MISSING (denoting the absence of a value).
Every value also has a "truth" value; these truth value conversions are explained in xref:n1ql-language-reference/booleanlogic.adoc[Boolean Logic].

== Booleans

----
TRUE | FALSE
----

Boolean propositions evaluate to TRUE and FALSE.
These values are case-insensitive.

== Numbers

----
[-] [integer] [fraction] [exponent]
----

Integer:

Fraction:

Exponent:

----
e | E  [ + | - ]  digits
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/exponent.png["Syntax diagram"]

Numbers can be either signed or unsigned integers with an optional fractional component and an optional exponent.
If the integer component has more than one digit, the number should not start with a leading zero.

== Strings

----
" char* " | ' char* '
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/string.png["Syntax diagram"]

Strings can be either Unicode characters or escaped characters.

Character:

== NULL

The literal NULL represents an empty value.

----
NULL
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/null.png["Syntax diagram"]

This value is case-insensitive.

== MISSING

The MISSING literal is specific to N1QL and represents a missing name-value pair in a document.

----
MISSING
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/missing.png["Syntax diagram"]

This value is case-insensitive.
