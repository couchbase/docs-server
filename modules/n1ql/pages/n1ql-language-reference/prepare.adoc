[[purpose]]
== Purpose

Building plans for N1QL requests may be expensive, in particular where a cluster has many indexes.
Sometimes planning may take more time than actually executing a request.

If you know that a statement text will be executed repeatedly, you can request the N1QL service to prepare the execution plan beforehand, and then request to execute the prepared plan as many times as needed, thereby avoiding the cost of repeated planning.

[[syntax]]
== Syntax

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/utility.ebnf[tag=prepare]

image::n1ql-language-reference/prepare.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

statement::
The full text of the N1QL statement to prepare.
The N1QL statement may contain parameters.
For more details, refer to <<parameters>> below.

=== FORCE

[Optional] The FORCE keyword forces the query engine to create the prepared statement again, even if a matching prepared statement already exists in the cache.
For more details, refer to <<cache>> below.

The FORCE keyword does _not_ enable you to assign a new prepared statement to an existing name.

=== FROM / AS Clause

[Optional] The FROM or AS clause enables you to specify a name for the prepared statement.

name::
A local name for the prepared statement.
If you do not specify a local name for the prepared statement, the query engine generates a UUID from the statement text.
For more details, refer to <<result>> below.

[[query-context]]
== Query Context

ifeval::['{page-component-version}' == '7.0']
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 7.0)_
endif::[]

A prepared statement is created and stored relative to the current _query context_.
You can create multiple prepared statements with the same name, each stored relative to a different query context.
This enables you to run multiple instances of the same application against different datasets.

To execute a prepared statement, the query context must be the same as it was when the prepared statement was created; otherwise the prepared statement will not be found.

You must therefore set the required query context, or unset the query context if necessary, before creating the prepared statement.
If you do not set the query context, it defaults to the empty string.

For further information, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#query-context[Query Context].

[[parameters]]
== Parameters

A prepared statement may contain parameters.
These are replaced by a supplied value when the statement is executed.
Parameters may be _named parameters_ or _positional parameters_.

Named parameters are specified by name when the prepared statement is executed.
To refer to a named parameter in a statement, use `$` followed by the name of the parameter, e.g. `$city`.

====
[source,N1QL]
----

----
====

Positional parameters are specified by the position of each supplied parameter when the statement is executed.
To refer to a positional parameter in a statement, use `$` followed by the position of the supplied parameter.
So `$1` refers to the first supplied parameter, `$2` refers to the second supplied parameter, etc.

====
[source,N1QL]
----
include::example$utility/prepare-numbers.n1ql[]
----
====

You may also use `?` to refer to a positional parameter in a statement.
In this case, the order of parameters in the statement must exactly match the order of parameters when the statement is executed.
So the first `?` refers to the first supplied parameter, the second `?` refers to the second supplied parameter, etc.

[[result]]
== Result

A JSON object is returned that contains the following properties:

name:: The full name of the prepared statement.
This has the format `[host:port]local-name-or-UUID`, and consists of:
+
* The host and port of the node where the prepared statement was created, in square brackets, followed by
* The local name that you specified for the prepared statement, or a UUID that was generated from the statement text.

+
The host and port can be used when executing to retrieve the prepared statement from the node where it was created.

operator:: The execution plan of the statement being prepared.

signature:: The signature of the statement being prepared.

text:: The full PREPARE statement text.

encoded_plan:: The full prepared statement in encoded format.
This is included for backward compatibility.
In versions of Couchbase Server prior to Couchbase Server 6.5, you can use the encoded plan in a request to execute a prepared statement.

[[cache]]
== Statement Cache

Prepared statements are stored in the prepared statement cache until you restart the Couchbase Server.

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, the query engine uses the prepared statement cache to speed up the creation of prepared statements.

When you create a prepared statement with a local name:

* The query engine checks whether a prepared statement with that name already exists.

** If it does not, the prepared statement is created.

** If it does, the query engine checks whether the text of your N1QL statement matches the N1QL statement associated with the existing prepared statement.

*** If it does not match, a duplicate name error is generated.

*** If it matches, the existing prepared statement is returned.
However, if the FORCE keyword is present, the prepared statement is created again.

When you create an anonymous prepared statement, i.e. a prepared statement without a local name:

* The query engine generates a UUID from the statement text.

* The query engine then searches the prepared cache to see if the UUID is already listed.

** If not found, the statement is created and added to the prepared cache.

** If found, the existing prepared statement is returned.
However, if the FORCE keyword is present, the prepared statement is created again.

[NOTE]
When you create an anonymous prepared statement, if there is a named prepared statement in the cache with identical statement text, the named prepared statement is not returned.
The anonymous prepared statement is added to the cache in addition to the named prepared statement.

[[auto-prepare]]
== Auto-Prepare

When the _auto-prepare_ feature is active, a prepared statement is created every time you submit a N1QL request, whether you use the PREPARE statement or not.

The process is similar to creating a prepared statement without a local name:

* The query engine generates a UUID from the statement text.

* The query engine then searches the prepared cache to see if the UUID is already listed.

** If found, the existing prepared statement is returned.

** If not found, the statement is created and added to the prepared cache.

The auto-prepare feature is inactive by default.
You can turn the auto-prepare feature on or off using the `auto-prepare` service-level query setting.
For more details, refer to xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#auto-prepare[Query Settings].

Auto-prepare is disabled for N1QL requests which contain parameters, if they do not use the PREPARE statement.

[[auto-execute]]
== Auto-Execute

When the _auto-execute_ feature is active, a prepared statement is executed automatically as soon as it is created.
This saves you from having to make two separate N1QL requests in cases where you want to prepare a statement and execute it immediately.

When this feature is active, a N1QL request to prepare a statement returns the xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#results[result of the execution step].
It does not return the full <<result,result of the preparation step>>, such as the execution plan.
However, the output of the N1QL request does include a `prepared` field, which contains the full name of the prepared statement.
You can use this when you need to execute the prepared statement again.

The auto-execute feature is inactive by default.
You can turn the auto-execute feature on or off using the `auto_execute` request-level query setting.
For more details, refer to xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#auto_execute[Query Settings].

The auto-execute feature only works for N1QL requests which actually contain the PREPARE statement.
Prepared statements created by the <<auto-prepare,auto-prepare>> feature are not executed by the auto-execute feature.

[[propagation]]
== Statement Propagation

When prepared, new statements are distributed to all query nodes.

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, when a query node is started or restarted, the prepared statement cache is primed from another node.

If it is not possible to prime the statement cache from another node, you must prepare the statements again before you can execute them.

[[authorization]]
== Authorization

The user executing the PREPARE statement must have the RBAC privileges of the statement being prepared.
For more details about user roles, refer to xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

For example,

To execute the following statement, user must have the _Query Select_ privilege on both keyspaces `pass:c[`travel-sample`.inventory.airport]` and `pass:c[`travel-sample`.inventory.landmark]`.

====
[source,N1QL]
----
PREPARE SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport
WHERE city = (SELECT RAW city FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark)
----
====

To execute the following statement, user must have the _Query Update_ and _Query Select_ privileges on `pass:c[`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel]`.

====
[source,N1QL]
----
PREPARE UPDATE `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel
SET city = "San Francisco" WHERE lower(city) = "sanfrancisco"
RETURNING *
