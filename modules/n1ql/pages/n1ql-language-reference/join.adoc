[abstract]
The `JOIN` clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two or more source objects.

== Purpose

The `JOIN` clause is used within the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause.
It creates an input object by combining two or more source objects.
Couchbase Server supports three types of `JOIN` clause, which are described in the sections below: <<section_ek1_jnx_1db,ANSI JOIN>>, <<lookup-join-clause,Lookup JOIN>>, and <<index-join-clause,Index JOIN>>.

== Prerequisites

For you to select data from keyspace or expression, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on that keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== ANSI JOIN Clause

=== Purpose

To be closer to standard SQL syntax, ANSI JOIN can join arbitrary fields of the documents and can be chained together.

----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ansi-join-type.png[]

This clause represents the type of ANSI join.

`INNER`::
For each joined object produced, both the left-hand side and right-hand side source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`RIGHT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `RIGHT` as `RIGHT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the right-hand source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default is `INNER`.

The following table summarizes the ANSI join types currently supported, and describes how you may chain them together.

[NOTE]
--
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, if you create either of the following:

* A LEFT OUTER JOIN where all the NULL or MISSING results on the right-hand side are filtered out by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE clause] or by the ON clause of a subsequent INNER JOIN, or
* A RIGHT OUTER JOIN where all the NULL or MISSING results on the left-hand side are filtered out by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE clause] or by the ON clause of a subsequent INNER JOIN,

Then the query is transformed internally into an INNER JOIN for greater efficiency.

[#ansi-join-predicate]
==== Join Predicate

[subs="normal"]
----
ansi-join-predicate ::= ON expr
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ansi-join-predicate.png[]

`expr`:: Boolean expression representing the join condition between the left-hand side <<section_nkd_3nx_1db>> and the <<ansi-join-rhs>>.
This expression may contain fields, constant expressions, or any complex N1QL expression.

=== Limitations

* A RIGHT OUTER join is only supported when it’s the only join in the query; or when it's the first join in a chain of joins.
* No mixing of ANSI join syntax with lookup or index join syntax in the same FROM clause.
* If the right-hand side of an ANSI join is a keyspace reference, then for the nested-loop join method an appropriate secondary index must exist on the right-hand side keyspace; for the hash join method, a primary index can be used.
* Adaptive indexes are not considered when selecting indexes on inner side of the join.

----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ansi-use-clause.png[]

Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition supports two join methods for performing ANSI join: nested-loop join and hash join.
Two corresponding join hints are introduced: `USE HASH` and `USE NL`.

The ANSI join hints are similar to the xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-index-clause[USE INDEX] or xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-keys-clause[USE KEYS] hints.
The ANSI join hints can be specified after the right-hand side of an ANSI join specification.

NOTE: The join hint for the first join should be specified on the first join's right-hand side, and the join hint for the second join should be specified on the second join's right-hand side, etc.
If a join hint is specified on the first FROM term, i.e. the first join's left-hand side, an error is returned.

[discrete]
===== Default Join Method

In Enterprise Edition, for an ANSI join with a subquery or a generic expression as the right-hand side, the default method is hash.
In this case:

* The subquery or expression on the right-hand side of the join is used as the <<use-hash-hint,build side>> of the hash join.
If `USE HASH(PROBE)` is specified, then the expression or subquery will be used as the <<use-hash-hint,probe side>> of the hash join.

* If an expression on the right-hand side is <<ansi-generic-expr,correlated>>, a nested-loop join is used.
(If a subquery on the right-hand side is <<ansi-subquery-expr,correlated>>, the query returns an error.)

* If a hash join is not feasible or not supported, or if the `USE NL` hint is specified, a nested-loop join is used.

For other types of join, the default method is nested-loop.
In this case:

* Hash join is only considered when the `USE HASH` hint is specified, and it requires at least one equality predicate between the left-hand side and right-hand side.

* If the join meets these conditions, hash join is used.
If the hash join cannot be generated, then the planner will further consider nested-loop join, and will either generate a nested-loop join or return an error for the join.

* If no join hint is specified, or the `USE NL` hint is specified, then nested-loop join is considered.

NOTE: For Community Edition (CE), only nested-loop join is considered by the planner, and any specified `USE HASH` hint will be silently ignored.

[#use-hash-hint]

[subs="normal"]
----
use-hash-term ::= HASH '(' ( BUILD | PROBE ) ')'
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/use-hash-predicate.png[]
--

There are two versions of the `USE HASH` hint:

* `USE HASH(BUILD)` -- The right-hand side of the join is to be used as the build side.
* `USE HASH(PROBE)` -- The right-hand side of the join is to be used as the probe side.

A hash join has two sides: a *build* side and a *probe* side.
The build side of the join will be used to create an in-memory hash table.
The probe side will use that table to find matches and perform the join.
Typically, this means you want the build side to be used on the smaller of the two sets.
However, you can only supply one hash hint, and only to the right side of the join.
So if you specify `BUILD` on the right side, then you are implicitly using `PROBE` on the left side (and vice versa).

[#USE-HASH-Example-1]
.USE HASH with PROBE
====
The keyspace `aline` is to be joined (with `rte`) using hash join, and `aline` is used as the probe side of the hash join.

[source,N1QL]

----

image::n1ql-language-reference/other-hint-predicates.png[]
--

You can use only one join hint (USE HASH or USE NL) together with only one other hint (USE INDEX or USE KEYS) for a total of two hints.
The order of the two hints doesn't matter.

When multiple hints are being specified, use only one `USE` keyword with one following the other, as in the following examples.

[#Multiple-hint-Example-1]
.USE INDEX with USE HASH
====
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE INDEX idx1 HASH (PROBE)
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----
====

[#Multiple-hint-Example-2]
.USE HASH with USE KEYS
====
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT COUNT(1) AS Total_Count
FROM `travel-sample` rte
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` aline
USE HASH (PROBE) KEYS ["airline_key1", "airline_key2", "airline_key3"]
ON (rte.airlineid = META(aline).id)
WHERE rte.type = "route";
----
====

When chosen, the hash join will always work; the restrictions are on any USE KEYS hint clause:

* Must not depend on any previous keyspaces.
* The expression must be constants, host variables, etc.
* Must not contain any subqueries.

NOTE: If the USE KEYS hint contains references to other keyspaces or subqueries, then the USE HASH hint will be ignored and nested-loop join will be used instead.

== ANSI JOIN and Arrays

ANSI JOIN provides great flexibility since the `ON` clause of an ANSI JOIN can be any expression as long as it evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.
Below are different join scenarios involving arrays and ways to handle each scenario.

[NOTE]
====
These buckets and indexes will be used throughout this section's array scenarios.
As a convention, when a field name starts with `a` it is an array, so each bucket has two array fields and two regular fields.
Also, both `_idx1` indexes index each element of its array, while both `_idx2` indexes use its entire array as the index key.

`bucket b1 (a11, a12, c11, c12)`

`bucket b2 (a21, a22, c21, c22)`

[source,N1QL]
----
CREATE INDEX b1_idx1 ON b1 (c11, c12, DISTINCT a11);
CREATE INDEX b1_idx2 ON b1 (a12);
CREATE INDEX b2_idx1 ON b2 (c21, c22, DISTINCT a21);
CREATE INDEX b2_idx2 ON b2 (a22);
----
====

=== ANSI JOIN with No Arrays

In this scenario, there is no involvement of arrays in the join.
These are just straight-forward joins:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

Here the joins are using non-array fields of each keyspace.

The following case also falls in this scenario:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

In this example, although there is an ANY predicate on the right-hand side array `b2.a21`, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus, as far as the join is concerned, it is still a 1-to-1 join.
Similarly:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 20 END;
----

In this case the ANY predicate is on the left-hand side array `b1.a11`; however, similar to above, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus the join is still 1-to-1.
We can even have ANY predicates on both sides:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 10 END;
----

Again, the ANY predicates do not involve any join, and the join is still 1-to-1.

=== ANSI JOIN with Entire Array as Index Key

As a special case, it is possible to perform ANSI JOIN on an entire array as a join key:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.a21 = b2.a22
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

In this case, the entire array must match each other for the join to work.
For all practical purposes, the array here is treated as a scalar since there is no logic to iterate through elements of an array here.
The entire array is used as an index key (`b2_idx2`) and as such, an entire array is used as an index span to probe the index.
The join here can also be considered as 1-to-1.

=== ANSI JOIN Involving Right-Hand Side Arrays

In this scenario, the join involves an array on the right-hand side keyspace:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = b1.c12 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10;
----

In this case, the ANY predicate involves a join, and thus, effectively we are joining `b1` with elements of the `b2.a21` array.
This now becomes a 1-to-many join.
Note that we use an ANY clause for this scenario since it’s a natural extension of the existing support for array indexes; the only difference is for index span generation, we now can have a potential join expression.
Array indexes can be used for join in this scenario.

=== ANSI JOIN Involving Left-Hand Side Arrays

This is a slightly more complex scenario, where the array reference is on the left-hand side of the join, and it’s a many-to-1 join.
There are two alternative ways to handle the scenario where the array appears on the left-hand side of the join.

==== Use UNNEST

This alternative will flatten the left-hand side array first, before performing the join:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1 UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
JOIN b2
  ON ba1 = b2.c22
  AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

The <<unnest,UNNEST>> operation is used to flatten the array, turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents; and then for each one of them, join with the right-hand side.
This way, by the time join is being performed, it is a regular join, since the array is already flattened in the UNNEST step.

==== Use IN clause

This alternative uses the IN clause to handle the array:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c22 IN b1.a12 AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10 AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

By using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[IN] clause, the right-hand side field value can match any of the elements of the left-hand side array.
Conceptually, we are using each element of the left-hand side array to probe the right-hand side index.

==== Differences Between the Two Alternatives

There is a semantical difference between the two alternatives.
With UNNEST, we are first turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents and then performing the join.
With IN-clause, there is still only one left-hand side document, which can then join with one or more right-hand side documents.
Thus:

* If the array contains duplicate values,
 ** the UNNEST method treats each duplicate as an individual value and thus duplicated results will be returned;
 ** the IN clause method will not duplicate the result.

* If no duplicate values exists and we are performing inner join,
 ** then the two alternatives will likely give the same result.

* If outer join is performed, assuming there are N elements in the left-hand side array, and assuming there is at most one matching document from the right-hand side for each element of the array,
 ** the UNNEST method will produce N result documents;
 ** the IN clause method may produce < N result documents if some of the array elements do not have matching right-hand side documents.

=== ANSI JOIN with Arrays on Both Sides

If the join involves arrays on both sides, then we can combine the approaches above, i.e., using ANY clause to handle the right-hand side array and either UNNEST or IN clause to handle the left-hand side array.
For example:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
  JOIN b2
    ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = ba1 END
    AND b2.c21 = 10
    AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

or

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v IN b1.a12 END
  AND b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

[#lookup-join-clause]
== Lookup JOIN Clause

=== Purpose

Lookup joins allow only left-to-right joins, which means the ON KEYS expression must produce a document key which is then used to retrieve documents from the right-hand side keyspace.
Couchbase Server version 4.1 and earlier supported only lookup joins.

=== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
lookup-join-clause ::= [ <<lookup-join-type,lookup-join-type>> ] JOIN <<lookup-join-rhs,lookup-join-rhs>> <<lookup-join-predicate,lookup-join-predicate>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/lookup-join-clause.png["lookup-join-type? 'JOIN' lookup-join-rhs lookup-join-predicate"]

[#lookup-join-type]
==== Join Type

[subs="normal"]
----
lookup-join-type ::= INNER | ( LEFT [ OUTER ] )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/lookup-join-type.png[]

This clause represents the type of join.

`INNER`::
For each joined object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default is `INNER`.

[#lookup-join-rhs]
==== Join Right-Hand Side

[subs="normal"]
----
lookup-join-rhs ::= <<lookup-keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref>> [ [ AS ] <<lookup-as-alias,alias>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/rhs-keyspace.png["keyspace-ref ( 'AS'? alias )?"]

[#lookup-keyspace-ref]
===== Keyspace Reference

Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the lookup join.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#from-keyspace-ref[Keyspace Reference].

NOTE: The right-hand side of a lookup join must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand side of a lookup join.

[#lookup-as-alias]
===== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the right-hand side of the lookup join.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the keyspace reference is optional.
If you assign an alias to the keyspace reference, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[#lookup-join-predicate]
==== Join Predicate

[subs="normal"]
----
lookup-join-predicate ::= ON [ PRIMARY ] KEYS expr
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/lookup-join-predicate.png[]

The `ON KEYS` expression produces a document key or array of document keys for the right-hand side of the lookup join.

expr::
[Required] String or expression representing the primary keys of the documents for the right-hand side keyspace.

=== Return Values

If `LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER` is specified, then a left outer join is performed.

At least one joined object is produced for each left-hand source object.

If the right-hand source object is `NULL` or `MISSING`, then the joined object's right-hand side value is also `NULL` or `MISSING` (omitted), respectively.

=== Limitations

Lookup JOINs can be chained with other lookup joins/nests or index joins/nests, but they cannot be mixed with an ANSI JOIN or ANSI NEST.

=== Examples

[#index-join-clause]
== Index JOIN Clause

=== Purpose

Index JOINs allow you to flip the direction of your join clause.
When Lookup JOINs cannot efficiently join left-hand side documents with right-to-left joins, and your situation cannot be flipped because your predicate needs to be on the left-hand side (such as <<Lookup-JOIN-Example-1>> above where airline documents have no reference to route documents), then Index JOINs can be used efficiently without making a Cartesian product of all route documents.

NOTE: For index joins, the syntax uses `ON KEY` (singular) instead of `ON KEYS` (plural).
This is because an Index JOIN's `ON KEY` expression must produce a scalar value; whereas a Lookup JOIN's `ON KEYS` expression can produce either a scalar or an array value.

=== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
index-join-clause ::= [ <<index-join-type,index-join-type>> ] JOIN <<index-join-rhs,index-join-rhs>> <<index-join-predicate,index-join-predicate>>
----

[#index-join-type]
==== Join Type

[subs="normal"]
----
index-join-type ::= INNER | ( LEFT [ OUTER ] )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-join-type.png[]

This clause represents the type of join.

`INNER`:: For each joined object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default is `INNER`.

[#index-join-rhs]
==== Join Right-Hand Side

[subs="normal"]
----
index-join-rhs ::= <<index-keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref>> [ [ AS ] <<index-as-alias,alias>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/rhs-keyspace.png["keyspace-ref ( 'AS'? alias )?"]

[#index-keyspace-ref]
===== Keyspace Reference

Keyspace reference for right-hand side of an index join.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#from-keyspace-ref[Keyspace Reference].

NOTE: The right-hand side of an index join must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand side of an index join.

[#index-as-alias]
===== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the right-hand side of the index join.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the keyspace reference is optional.
If you assign an alias to the keyspace reference, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[#index-join-predicate]
==== Join Predicate

[subs="normal"]
----
index-join-predicate ::= ON [ PRIMARY ] KEY expr FOR alias
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-join-predicate.png[]

`expr`:: Expression in the form `__rhs-expression__.__lhs-expression-key__`:

`__rhs-expression__`;; Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the index join.

`__lhs-expression-key__`;; String or expression representing the attribute in `__rhs-expression__` and referencing the document key for `alias`.

`alias`:: Keyspace reference for the left-hand side of the index join.

=== Examples

[#Index-JOIN-Example-0]
.Use INDEX join to flip the direction of <<Lookup-JOIN-Example-1>> above
====
Consider the query below, similar to <<Lookup-JOIN-Example-1>> above with route and airline documents, where `route.airlineid` is the document key of route documents and airline documents have no reference to route documents:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT DISTINCT airline.name, airline.callsign, route.destinationairport,
 route.stops, route.airline
FROM `travel-sample` route
  JOIN `travel-sample` airline
  ON KEYS route.airlineid
WHERE route.type = "route"
AND airline.type = "airline"
AND airline.icao = "SEA"
LIMIT 4;
----

This query gets a list of Seattle (`SEA`) flights, but getting `SEA` flights cannot be efficiently executed without making a Cartesian product of all route documents (left-hand side) with all airline documents (right-hand side).

This query cannot use any index on airline to directly access SEA flights because airline is on the right-hand side.

Also, you cannot rewrite the query to put the airline document on the left-hand side (to use any index) and the route document on the right-hand side because the airline documents (on the left-hand side) have no primary keys to access the route documents (on the right-hand side).

Using index joins, the same query can be written as:

.Required Index
[source,N1QL]
----
CREATE INDEX route_airlineid ON `travel-sample`(airlineid) WHERE type="route";
----

.Optional Index
[source,N1QL]
----
CREATE INDEX airline_icao ON `travel-sample`(icao) WHERE type="airline";
----

.Query
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` airline
  JOIN `travel-sample` route
  ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline
WHERE route.type="route"
AND airline.type="airline"
AND airline.icao = "SEA";
----

If you generalize the same query, it looks like the following:

[subs="normal"]
----
CREATE INDEX _on-key-for-index-name_ _rhs-expression_ (__lhs-expression-key__);
----

[subs="normal"]
----
SELECT _projection-list_
FROM _lhs-expression_
JOIN _rhs-expression_
  ON KEY __rhs-expression__.__lhs-expression-key__ FOR _lhs-expression_
[ WHERE _predicates_ ] ;
----
====

There are three important changes in the index scan syntax example above:

* `CREATE INDEX` on the `ON KEY` expression `route.airlineid` to access `route` documents using `airlineid`, which are produced on the left-hand side.
* The `ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline` enables N1QL to use the index `route.airlineid`.
* Create any optional index such as `route.airline` that can be used on airline (left-hand side).

[#Index-JOIN-Example-1]
.`+ON KEY ... FOR+`
====
The following example counts the number of distinct "AA" airline routes for each airport after creating the following index, if not already created.

[source,N1QL]
