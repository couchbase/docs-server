[abstract]
The `JOIN` clause enables you to create new input objects by combining two or more source objects.

== Purpose

The `JOIN` clause is used within the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause.
It creates an input object by combining two or more source objects.
Couchbase Server supports three types of `JOIN` clause, which are described in the sections below: <<section_ek1_jnx_1db,ANSI JOIN>>, <<lookup-join-clause,Lookup JOIN>>, and <<index-join-clause,Index JOIN>>.

In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, you may also use comma-separated joins.
For further details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/comma.adoc[].

== Prerequisites

For you to select data from keyspace or expression, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on that keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

This clause represents the type of ANSI join.

`INNER`::
For each joined object produced, both the left-hand side and right-hand side source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`RIGHT [OUTER]`::
{startsb}Query Service interprets `RIGHT` as `RIGHT OUTER`{endsb}
+
For each joined object produced, only the right-hand source objects of the `ON` clause must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default is `INNER`.

The following table summarizes the ANSI join types currently supported, and describes how you may chain them together.

[NOTE]
--
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, if you create either of the following:

* A LEFT OUTER JOIN where all the NULL or MISSING results on the right-hand side are filtered out by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE clause] or by the ON clause of a subsequent INNER JOIN, or
* A RIGHT OUTER JOIN where all the NULL or MISSING results on the left-hand side are filtered out by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE clause] or by the ON clause of a subsequent INNER JOIN,

Then the query is transformed internally into an INNER JOIN for greater efficiency.

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=ansi-join-predicate]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ansi-join-predicate.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

`expr`:: Boolean expression representing the join condition between the left-hand side <<section_nkd_3nx_1db,FROM term>> and the <<ansi-join-rhs>>.
This expression may contain fields, constant expressions, or any complex {sqlpp} expression.

=== Limitations

* A RIGHT OUTER join is only supported when it’s the only join in the query; or when it's the first join in a chain of joins.

* No mixing of ANSI join syntax with lookup or index join syntax in the same FROM clause.

* If the right-hand side of an ANSI join is a keyspace reference, then for the nested-loop join method an appropriate secondary index must exist on the right-hand side keyspace; for the hash join method, a primary index can be used.

* Adaptive indexes are not considered when selecting indexes on inner side of the join.

* You may chain ANSI joins with comma-separated joins; however, the comma-separated joins must come after any JOIN, NEST, or UNNEST clauses.

=== Examples

[#ANSI-Join-Example-4]
.Inner Join with Covering Index
====
Use an ANSI JOIN to list the routes and destination airports that are available from London Heathrow (ICAO code `EGLL`).

By default, the ANSI JOIN uses the `def_inventory_route_sourceairport` index, which is installed with the `travel-sample` bucket.
This index has `sourceairport` as its leading key.

.Index

If no covering index is available, the Query Service has to fetch each matching record from the `route` keyspace to get the airline and destination airport information, as shown in the query plan:

image::FROM_AnsiJoin-Ex4-BeerVisual1.png["Query plan with Fetch 'route' step before Nested Loop Join"]

If you create a covering index, with `sourceairport` as the leading key, and `airline` and `destinationairport` as additional index keys:

In this case, only a <<ansi-join-hints,nested-loop join>> may be used.

[#ansi-generic-alias]
==== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the generic expression.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

You must assign an alias to the generic expression if it is not an identifier; otherwise, assigning an alias is optional.

multiple-hints:: <<multiple-hints>> icon:caret-down[]

Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition supports two join methods for performing ANSI join: nested-loop join and hash join.
Two corresponding join hints are introduced: `USE HASH` and `USE NL`.

The ANSI join hints are similar to the xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-index-clause[USE INDEX] or xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-keys-clause[USE KEYS] hints.
The ANSI join hints can be specified after the right-hand side of an ANSI join specification.

NOTE: The join hint for the first join should be specified on the first join's right-hand side, and the join hint for the second join should be specified on the second join's right-hand side, etc.
If a join hint is specified on the first FROM term, i.e. the first join's left-hand side, an error is returned.

TIP: In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, you can also supply a join hint within a specially-formatted xref:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[hint comment].
Note that you cannot specify a join hint for the same keyspace using both the `USE` clause and a hint comment.
If you do this, the `USE` clause and the hint comment are both marked as erroneous and ignored by the optimizer.

[#default-join-method]
.Default Join Method
****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

In Enterprise Edition, for an ANSI join with a subquery or a generic expression as the right-hand side, the default method is hash.
In this case:

* The subquery or expression on the right-hand side of the join is used as the <<use-hash-hint,build side>> of the hash join.
If `USE HASH(PROBE)` is specified, then the expression or subquery will be used as the <<use-hash-hint,probe side>> of the hash join.

* If an expression on the right-hand side is <<ansi-generic-expr,correlated>>, a nested-loop join is used.
(If a subquery on the right-hand side is <<ansi-subquery-expr,correlated>>, the query returns an error.)

* If a hash join is not feasible or not supported, or if the `USE NL` hint is specified, a nested-loop join is used.

For other types of join, the default method is nested-loop.
In this case:

* Hash join is only considered when the `USE HASH` hint is specified, and it requires at least one equality predicate between the left-hand side and right-hand side.

* If the join meets these conditions, hash join is used.
If the hash join cannot be generated, then the planner will further consider nested-loop join, and will either generate a nested-loop join or return an error for the join.

* If no join hint is specified, or the `USE NL` hint is specified, then nested-loop join is considered.

'''

[.edition]#{community}#

For Community Edition (CE), only nested-loop join is considered by the planner, and any specified `USE HASH` hint will be silently ignored.

[#use-hash-hint]
=== USE HASH Hint

[source,ebnf]

----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=use-hash-term]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/use-hash-term.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

There are two versions of the `USE HASH` hint:

* `USE HASH(BUILD)` -- The right-hand side of the join is to be used as the build side.
* `USE HASH(PROBE)` -- The right-hand side of the join is to be used as the probe side.

A hash join has two sides: a *build* side and a *probe* side.
The build side of the join will be used to create an in-memory hash table.
The probe side will use that table to find matches and perform the join.
Typically, this means you want the build side to be used on the smaller of the two sets.
However, you can only supply one hash hint, and only to the right side of the join.
So if you specify `BUILD` on the right side, then you are implicitly using `PROBE` on the left side (and vice versa).

In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, this clause is equivalent to the `USE_HASH` optimizer hint.
For more details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-hints.adoc#use-hash[Keyspace Hints].

----

image::n1ql-language-reference/other-hint-terms.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

You can use only one join hint (<<use-hash-term,USE HASH>> or <<use-nl-term,USE NL>>) together with only one other hint (xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-index-term[USE INDEX] or xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-keys-term[USE KEYS]) for a total of two hints.
The order of the two hints doesn't matter.

When multiple hints are being specified, use only one `USE` keyword with one following the other, as shown in <<Multiple-hint-Example-1>> and <<Multiple-hint-Example-2>>.

When chosen, the hash join will always work; the restrictions are on any USE KEYS hint clause:

* Must not depend on any previous keyspaces.
* The expression must be constants, host variables, etc.
* Must not contain any subqueries.

NOTE: If the USE KEYS hint contains references to other keyspaces or subqueries, then the USE HASH hint will be ignored and nested-loop join will be used instead.

== ANSI JOIN and Arrays

ANSI JOIN provides great flexibility since the `ON` clause of an ANSI JOIN can be any expression as long as it evaluates to TRUE or FALSE.
Below are different join scenarios involving arrays and ways to handle each scenario.

[NOTE]
====
These keyspaces and indexes will be used throughout this section's array scenarios.
As a convention, when a field name starts with `a` it is an array, so each keyspace has two array fields and two regular fields.

[plantuml,ansi-join-example,svg]
....
@startuml
object "Keyspace b1" as b1 {
a11
a12
c11
c12
}

object "Keyspace b2" as b2 {
a21
a22
c21
c22
}
@enduml
....

Within each keyspace, both `_idx1` indexes index each element of its array, while both `_idx2` indexes use its entire array as the index key.

[source,sqlpp]
----
CREATE INDEX b1_idx1 ON b1 (c11, c12, DISTINCT a11);
CREATE INDEX b1_idx2 ON b1 (a12);
CREATE INDEX b2_idx1 ON b2 (c21, c22, DISTINCT a21);
CREATE INDEX b2_idx2 ON b2 (a22);
----
====

=== ANSI JOIN with No Arrays

In this scenario, there is no involvement of arrays in the join.
These are just straight-forward joins:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

Here the joins are using non-array fields of each keyspace.

The following case also falls in this scenario:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c12 = 10;
----

In this example, although there is an ANY predicate on the right-hand side array `b2.a21`, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus, as far as the join is concerned, it is still a 1-to-1 join.
Similarly:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 20 END;
----

In this case the ANY predicate is on the left-hand side array `b1.a11`; however, similar to above, the ANY predicate does not involve any joins, and thus the join is still 1-to-1.
We can even have ANY predicates on both sides:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.c11 = b2.c21
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = 10 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b1.a11 SATISFIES v = 10 END;
----

Again, the ANY predicates do not involve any join, and the join is still 1-to-1.

=== ANSI JOIN with Entire Array as Index Key

As a special case, it is possible to perform ANSI JOIN on an entire array as a join key:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b1.a21 = b2.a22
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

In this case, the entire array must match each other for the join to work.
For all practical purposes, the array here is treated as a scalar since there is no logic to iterate through elements of an array here.
The entire array is used as an index key (`b2_idx2`) and as such, an entire array is used as an index span to probe the index.
The join here can also be considered as 1-to-1.

=== ANSI JOIN Involving Right-Hand Side Arrays

In this scenario, the join involves an array on the right-hand side keyspace:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
  AND ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = b1.c12 END
WHERE b1.c11 = 10;
----

In this case, the ANY predicate involves a join, and thus, effectively we are joining `b1` with elements of the `b2.a21` array.
This now becomes a 1-to-many join.
Note that we use an ANY clause for this scenario since it’s a natural extension of the existing support for array indexes; the only difference is for index span generation, we now can have a potential join expression.
Array indexes can be used for join in this scenario.

=== ANSI JOIN Involving Left-Hand Side Arrays

This is a slightly more complex scenario, where the array reference is on the left-hand side of the join, and it’s a many-to-1 join.
There are two alternative ways to handle the scenario where the array appears on the left-hand side of the join.

==== Use UNNEST

This alternative will flatten the left-hand side array first, before performing the join:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1 UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
JOIN b2
  ON ba1 = b2.c22
  AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

The <<unnest,UNNEST>> operation is used to flatten the array, turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents; and then for each one of them, join with the right-hand side.
This way, by the time join is being performed, it is a regular join, since the array is already flattened in the UNNEST step.

==== Use IN clause

This alternative uses the IN clause to handle the array:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON b2.c22 IN b1.a12 AND b2.c21 = 10
WHERE b1.c11 = 10 AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

By using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[IN] clause, the right-hand side field value can match any of the elements of the left-hand side array.
Conceptually, we are using each element of the left-hand side array to probe the right-hand side index.

==== Differences Between the Two Alternatives

There is a semantical difference between the two alternatives.
With UNNEST, we are first turning one left-hand side document into multiple documents and then performing the join.
With IN-clause, there is still only one left-hand side document, which can then join with one or more right-hand side documents.
Thus:

* If the array contains duplicate values,
 ** the UNNEST method treats each duplicate as an individual value and thus duplicated results will be returned;
 ** the IN clause method will not duplicate the result.

* If no duplicate values exists and we are performing inner join,
 ** then the two alternatives will likely give the same result.

* If outer join is performed, assuming there are N elements in the left-hand side array, and assuming there is at most one matching document from the right-hand side for each element of the array,
 ** the UNNEST method will produce N result documents;
 ** the IN clause method may produce < N result documents if some of the array elements do not have matching right-hand side documents.

=== ANSI JOIN with Arrays on Both Sides

If the join involves arrays on both sides, then we can combine the approaches above, i.e., using ANY clause to handle the right-hand side array and either UNNEST or IN clause to handle the left-hand side array.
For example:

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
UNNEST b1.a12 AS ba1
  JOIN b2
    ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v = ba1 END
    AND b2.c21 = 10
    AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

or

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
FROM b1
JOIN b2
  ON ANY v IN b2.a21 SATISFIES v IN b1.a12 END
  AND b2.c21 = 10
  AND b2.c22 = 100
WHERE b1.c11 = 10
  AND b1.c12 = 100;
----

[#lookup-join-clause]
== Lookup JOIN Clause

=== Purpose

A _lookup join_ is a legacy syntax for joins.
It enables you to join a foreign key field on the left-hand side of the join with the primary xref:learn:data/data.adoc#keys[document key] on the right-hand side of the join.
Couchbase Server version 4.1 and earlier supported only lookup joins.

In the join predicate for a lookup join, the `ON KEYS` expression must refer to the foreign key in the left-hand side keyspace.
This is then used to retrieve documents from the right-hand side keyspace.

Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the lookup join.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#from-keyspace-ref[Keyspace Reference].

NOTE: The right-hand side of a lookup join must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand side of a lookup join.

[source,ebnf]
----

The `ON KEYS` expression produces a document key or array of document keys, which is used to retrieve documents from the right-hand side keyspace.

expr::
[Required] String or expression representing the foreign key in the left-hand side keyspace.

=== Return Values

If `LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER` is specified, then a left outer join is performed.

At least one joined object is produced for each left-hand source object.

If the right-hand source object is `NULL` or `MISSING`, then the joined object's right-hand side value is also `NULL` or `MISSING` (omitted), respectively.

=== Limitations

Lookup joins can be chained with other lookup joins or nests and index joins or nests, but they cannot be mixed with ANSI joins, ANSI nests, or comma-separated joins.

[#index-join-clause]
== Index JOIN Clause

=== Purpose

An _index join_ is another legacy syntax for joins which reverses the direction of a lookup join.
It enables you to join the primary xref:learn:data/data.adoc#keys[document key] on the left-hand side of the join with a foreign key field on the right-hand side of the join.

You can use an index join when a lookup join would be inefficient, and you need to flip the relationship so the join predicate is on the right-hand side of the join.

For index joins, the syntax uses `ON KEY ... FOR` (singular) instead of `ON KEYS` (plural).
This is because an index join's `ON KEY ... FOR` expression produces a single scalar value; whereas a lookup join's `ON KEYS` expression can produce either a single scalar or an array of scalar values.

NOTE: An index join requires an inverse index on the foreign key in the keyspace on the right-hand side of the join.

[#Index-JOIN-Example-0]
.Use INDEX join to flip the direction of <<Lookup-JOIN-Example-1>> above
====
Consider the query below, similar to <<Lookup-JOIN-Example-1>> above with route and airline documents, where `route.airlineid` is the document key of route documents and airline documents have no reference to route documents:

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/index-join.n1ql[tag=lookup]
----

This query gets a list of Southwest Airlines (`SWA`) flights, but getting `SWA` flights cannot be efficiently executed without making a Cartesian product of all route documents (left-hand side) with all airline documents (right-hand side).

This query cannot use any index on airline to directly access SWA flights because airline is on the right-hand side.

Also, you cannot rewrite the query to put the airline document on the left-hand side (to use any index) and the route document on the right-hand side because the airline documents (on the left-hand side) have no primary keys to access the route documents (on the right-hand side).

Using index joins, the same query can be written as:

.Required Index
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/index-join.n1ql[tag=index-req]
----

.Optional Index
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/index-join.n1ql[tag=index-opt]
----

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$select/index-join.n1ql[tag=query]
----

.Results
[source,JSON]
----
include::example$select/index-join.jsonc[tags=extract;ellipsis]

If you generalize the same query, it looks like the following:

[subs="normal"]
----
CREATE INDEX _on-key-for-index-name_ _rhs-expression_ (__lhs-expression-key__);
----

[subs="normal"]
----
SELECT _projection-list_
FROM _lhs-expression_
JOIN _rhs-expression_
  ON KEY __rhs-expression__.__lhs-expression-key__ FOR _lhs-expression_
[ WHERE _predicates_ ] ;
----
====

There are three important changes in the index scan syntax example above:

* `CREATE INDEX` on the `ON KEY` expression `route.airlineid` to access `route` documents using `airlineid`, which are produced on the left-hand side.
* The `ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline` enables {sqlpp} to use the index `route.airlineid`.
* Create any optional index such as `route.airline` that can be used on airline (left-hand side).

[#Index-JOIN-Example-1]
.`+ON KEY ... FOR+`

The following example counts the number of distinct "AA" airline routes for each airport after creating the following index, if not already created.

[source,sqlpp]
----
CREATE INDEX route_airlineid ON route(airlineid);
