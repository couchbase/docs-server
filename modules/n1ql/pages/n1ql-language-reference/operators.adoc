* xref:n1ql-language-reference/collectionops.adoc[Collection operators] to evaluate expressions on collections or objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/comparisonops.adoc[Comparison operators] to compare two expressions.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[Conditional operators] to evaluate conditional logic in an expression
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/constructionops.adoc[Construction operators] to construct arrays and objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[Logical operators] to combine operators using Boolean logic.
