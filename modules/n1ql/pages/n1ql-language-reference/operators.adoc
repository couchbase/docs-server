N1QL provides a full set of operators that you can use within its statements.
Here are the categories of N1QL operators:

* xref:n1ql-language-reference/arithmetic.adoc[Arithmetic operators] to perform basic mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisions) on numbers.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/collectionops.adoc[Collection operators] to evaluate expressions on collections or objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/comparisonops.adoc[Comparison operators] to compare two expressions.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[Conditional operators] to evaluate conditional logic in an expression
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/constructionops.adoc[Construction operators] to construct arrays and objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[Logical operators] to combine operators using Boolean logic.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[Nested operators] to access nested elements and embedded arrays.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/stringops.adoc[String operators] to concatenate two expressions.
