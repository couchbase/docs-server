N1QL provides a full set of operators that you can use within its statements.
Here are the categories of N1QL operators:

* xref:n1ql-language-reference/arithmetic.adoc[Arithmetic Operators] to perform basic mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and divisions) on numbers.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/collectionops.adoc[Collection Operators] to evaluate expressions on collections or objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/comparisonops.adoc[Comparison Operators] to compare two expressions.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[Conditional Operators] to evaluate conditional logic in an expression
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/constructionops.adoc[Construction Operators] to construct arrays and objects.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[Logical Operators] to combine operators using Boolean logic.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[Nested Operators and Expressions] to access nested elements and embedded arrays.
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/stringops.adoc[String Operators] to concatenate two expressions.

== Operator Precedence

N1QL supports the use of parentheses to group operators and expressions.
Expressions enclosed in parentheses are evaluated first.

The following table shows operator precedence level.
An operator at a higher level is evaluated before an operator at a lower level.
