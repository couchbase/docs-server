= Bitwise Functions
:description: All Bit/Binary functions can only operate on 64-bit signed integers.

{description}

NOTE: All non-integer numbers and other data types result in null.

NOTE: Couchbase Server uses two's complement representation.

When looking at the value in binary form, bit 1 is the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and bit 32 is the Most Significant Bit (MSB).

(MSB) Bit 32 → `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` ← Bit 1 (LSB)

[#BitAND]
== BITAND ([.var]`int_value1`, [.var]`int_value2`, \...)

=== Description

Returns the result of a bitwise AND operation performed on all input integer values.

The bitwise AND operation compares each bit of [.var]`int_value1` to the corresponding bit of every other [.var]`int_value`.
If all bits are 1, then the corresponding result bit is set to 1; otherwise it is set to 0 (zero).

=== Arguments

int_value1, int_value2, \...:: Integers, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expressions] which evaluate to integers, that are used to compare.

=== Return Value

An integer, representing the bitwise AND between all of the input integers.

=== Limitations

Input values must be integers (such as 1 or 1.0) and cannot contain decimals (such as 1.2).

=== Examples

.AND-1
====
Compare 3 (0011 in binary) and 6 (0110 in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITAND(3,6) AS BitAND;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitAND": 2
  }
]
----

This results in 2 (0010 in binary) because only bit 2 is set in both 3 (00**1**1) and 6 (01**1**0).
====

.AND-2
====
Compare 4.5 and 3 (0011 in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITAND(4.5,3) AS BitAND;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitAND": null
  }
]
----

The result is null because 4.5 is not an integer.
====

.AND-3
====
Compare 4.0 (0100 in binary) and 3 (0011 in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITAND(4.0,3) AS BitAND;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitAND": 0
  }
]
----

This results in 0 (zero) because 4.0 (0100) and 3 (0011) do not share any bits that are both 1.
====

.AND-4
====
Compare 3 (0011 in binary) and 6 (0110 in binary) and 15 (1111 in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITAND(3,6,15) AS BitAND;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitAND": 2
  }
]
----

This results in 2 (0010 in binary) because only the 2nd bit from the right is 1 in all three numbers.
====

[#BitCLEAR]
== BITCLEAR ([.var]`int_value`, [.var]`positions`)

=== Description

Returns the result after clearing the specified bit, or array of bits in `int_value` using the given `positions`.

NOTE: Specifying a negative or zero bit position makes the function return a null.

=== Arguments

int_value:: An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, that contains the target bit or bits to clear.

positions:: An integer or an array of integers specifying the position or positions to be cleared.

=== Return Value

An integer, representing the result after clearing the bit or bits specified.

=== Limitations

Input values must be integers (such as 1 or 1.0) and cannot contain decimals (such as 1.2).

----
SELECT BITCLEAR(6,1) AS BitCLEAR;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----

  {
    "BitCLEAR": 6
  }
]
----

This results in 6 (011**0** in binary) because bit 1 was already zero.
====

.CLEAR-2
====
Clear bits 1 and 2 from 6 (01**10** in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITCLEAR(6,[1,2]) AS BitCLEAR;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitCLEAR": 4
  }
]

This results in 4 (01**0**0 in binary) because bit 2 changed to zero.
====

.CLEAR-3
====
Clear bits 1, 2, 4, and 5 from 31 (0**11**1**11** in binary).

[source,n1ql]

----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitCLEAR": 4

----

This results in 4 (0**00**1**00**) because bits 1, 2, 4, and 5 changed to zero.
====

[#BitNOT]
== BITNOT ([.var]`int_value`)

=== Description

Returns the results of a bitwise logical NOT operation performed on an integer value.

The bitwise logical NOT operation reverses the bits in the value.
For each value bit that is 1, the corresponding result bit will be set to 0 (zero); and for each value bit that is 0 (zero), the corresponding result bit will be set to 1.

NOTE: All bits of the integer will be altered by this operation.

=== Arguments

int_value:: An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, that contains the target bits to reverse.

=== Return Value

An integer, representing the result after performing the logical NOT operation.

=== Limitations

Input values must be integers (such as 1 or 1.0) and cannot contain decimals (such as 1.2).

=== Examples

.NOT-1
====
Perform the NOT operation on 3 (0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 in binary).

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT BITNOT(3) AS BitNOT;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitNOT": -4
  }
]
----

This results in -4 (*1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100* in binary) because all bits changed.
====

[#BitOR]
== BITOR ([.var]`int_value1`, [.var]`int_value2`, \...)

=== Description

Returns the result of a bitwise inclusive OR operation performed on all input integer values.

compares each bit of [.var]`int_value1` to the corresponding bit of every other [.var]`int_value`.
If any bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0 (zero).

=== Arguments

int_value1, int_value2, \...:: Integers, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expressions] which evaluate to integers, that are used to compare.

=== Return Value

An integer, representing the bitwise OR between all of the input integers.

=== Limitations

Input values must be integers (such as 1 or 1.0) and cannot contain decimals (such as 1.2).

=== Examples

.OR-1

----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitOR": 7
  }

----
SELECT BITOR(3,-4) AS BitOR;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "BitOR": -1
  }
]
----

This results in -1 (*1111 1111 1111 \... 1111 1111* in binary) because the two 1 bits in 3 fill in the two 0 bits in -4 to turn on all the bits.
====

.OR-3

====

[#BitSET]
== BITSET ([.var]`int_value`, [.var]`positions`)

=== Description

Returns the result after setting the specified bit `position`, or array of bit positions, to 1 in the given `int_value`.

NOTE: Specifying a negative or zero position makes the function return a null.

=== Arguments

int_value:: An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, that contains the target bit or bits to set.

positions:: An integer or an array of integers specifying the position or positions to be set.

=== Return Value

An integer, representing the result after setting the bit or bits specified.
If the bit is already set, then it stays set.

====

[#BitSHIFT]
== BITSHIFT ([.var]`int_value`, [.var]`shift_amount`, [.var]`rotate`)

=== Description

Returns the result of a bit shift operation performed on the integer value `int`.
The `shift_amount` supports left and right shifts.
These are logical shifts.
The third parameter `rotate` supports circular shift.
This is similar to the BitROTATE function in Oracle.

=== Arguments

int_value:: An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, that contains the target bit or bits to shift.

shift_amount::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, that contains the number of bits to shift.
+
A positive (+) number means this is a LEFT shift.
+
A negative (-) number means this is a RIGHT shift.

rotate:: [Optional; FALSE by default] A boolean, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a boolean, where:

* FALSE means this is a LOGICAL shift, where bits shifted off the end of a value are considered lost.

* TRUE means this is a CIRCULAR shift (shift-and-rotate operation), where bits shifted off the end of a value are rotated back onto the value at the _other_ end.
In other words, the bits rotate in what might be thought of as a circular pattern; therefore, these bits are not lost.

+
For comparison, see the below table.

[#BitXOR]
== BITXOR ([.var]`int_value1`, [.var]`int_value2`, \...)

=== Description

Returns the result of a bitwise Exclusive OR operation performed on two or more integer values.

The bitwise Exclusive OR operation compares each bit of `int_value1` to the corresponding bit of `int_value2`.

If there are more than two input values, the first two are compared; then their result is compared to the next input value; and so on.

When the compared bits do not match, the result bit is 1; otherwise, the compared bits do match, and the result bit is 0 (zero), as summarized:
