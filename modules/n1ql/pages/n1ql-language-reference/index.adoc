[abstract]
The N1QL reference guide describes the N1QL language structure and syntax.
It provides reference information about the basic elements in N1QL which can be combined to build N1QL statements.

== N1QL Language Structure

The N1QL language structure is composed of statements, expressions, and comments.

=== Statements

N1QL statements are categorized into the following groups:

* *Data Definition Language* (DDL) statements to xref:n1ql-language-reference/createindex.adoc[create indexes], modify indexes, and xref:n1ql-language-reference/dropindex.adoc[drop indexes].
* *Data Manipulation Language* (DML) statements to xref:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc[select], xref:n1ql-language-reference/insert.adoc[insert], xref:n1ql-language-reference/update.adoc[update], xref:n1ql-language-reference/delete.adoc[delete], and xref:n1ql-language-reference/upsert.adoc[upsert] data into JSON documents.

[[N1QL_Expressions]]
=== Expressions

The following are the different types of N1QL expressions:
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/literals.adoc[Literal values]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[Identifiers]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/arithmetic.adoc[Arithmetic terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/comparisonops.adoc[Comparison terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/stringops.adoc[Concatenation terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[Logical terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[Conditional expressions]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/collectionops.adoc[Collection expressions]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/constructionops.adoc[Construction expressions]
* <<nested-path-exp,Nested expressions>>
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/functions.adoc[Function calls]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc[Subqueries]

=== Comments

N1QL supports block comments with the following syntax:

----
/*  [ [text] | [newline] ]+  */
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/block-comment.png["Syntax diagram"]

A block comment starts with `/{asterisk}` and ends with `{asterisk}/`.
The query engine ignores the start and end markers `/{asterisk}&nbsp;{asterisk}/`, and any text between them.

A block comment may start on a new line, or in the middle of a line after other N1QL statements.
A block comment may contain line breaks.

There may also be further N1QL statements on the same line after the end of a block comment -- the query engine does _not_ ignore these.

[#nested-path-exp]
== Nested Path Expressions

In N1QL, nested paths indicate an expression to access nested sub-documents within a JSON document or expression.

For example, the latitude of a location in the `type="airport"` documents in the `pass:c[`travel-sample`]` are in the `geo` sub-document and can be addressed as the nested path `pass:c[`travel-sample`.geo.lat]`:

----
SELECT airportname, city, geo, round(geo.lat) as latitude
FROM `travel-sample` t1
WHERE t1.type = "airport" LIMIT 1;

[
  {
    "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
    "city": "Calais",
    "geo": {
      "alt": 12,
      "lat": 50.962097,
      "lon": 1.954764
    }
    "latitude": 51,
  }
]
----

You can use xref:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[nested operators] to access sub-document fields within a document.
