{description}
It provides information about the basic elements which can be combined to build {sqlpp} statements.
The Couchbase implementation of {sqlpp} was formerly known as https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[N1QL^].

[[n1ql-language-structure]]
The {sqlpp} language is composed of <<statements,statements>>, <<N1QL_Expressions,expressions>>, and <<comments,comments>>.

[[statements]]
== Statements

{sqlpp} statements are categorized into the following groups:

* *Data Definition Language* (DDL) statements to {createindex}[create indexes], {alterindex}[modify indexes], and {dropindex}[drop indexes].
* *Data Manipulation Language* (DML) statements to {selectintro}[select], {insert}[insert], {update}[update], {delete}[delete], and {upsert}[upsert] data into JSON documents.

[[N1QL_Expressions]]
== Expressions

The following are the different types of {sqlpp} expressions:

[.two-columns]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/literals.adoc[Literal values]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[Identifiers]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/arithmetic.adoc[Arithmetic terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/comparisonops.adoc[Comparison terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/stringops.adoc[Concatenation terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/logicalops.adoc[Logical terms]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[Conditional expressions]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/collectionops.adoc[Collection expressions]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/constructionops.adoc[Construction expressions]
* <<nested-path-exp,Nested expressions>>
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/functions.adoc[Function calls]
* xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc[Subqueries]

[#nested-path-exp]
=== Nested Path Expressions

In {sqlpp}, _nested paths_ indicate an expression to access nested sub-documents within a JSON document or expression.

For example, the latitude of a location in the `airport` keyspace is in the `geo` sub-document, and can be addressed as the nested path `geo.lat`:

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT airportname, city, geo, ROUND(geo.lat) AS latitude
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport t1
LIMIT 1;
----

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
    "city": "Calais",
    "geo": {
      "alt": 12,
      "lat": 50.962097,
      "lon": 1.954764
    }
    "latitude": 51,
  }
]
----
====

You can use xref:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[nested operators] to access sub-document fields within a document.

[[comments]]
== Comments

{sqlpp} supports _block comments_ and _line comments_.

=== Block Comments

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=block-comment]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/block-comment.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

A block comment starts with `/{asterisk}` and ends with `{asterisk}/`.
The query engine ignores the start and end markers `/{asterisk}&nbsp;{asterisk}/`, and any text between them.

A block comment may start on a new line, or in the middle of a line after other {sqlpp} statements.
A block comment may contain line breaks.

There may also be further {sqlpp} statements on the same line after the end of a block comment -- the query engine does _not_ ignore these.

=== Line Comments

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=line-comment]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/line-comment.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

You can use line comments in Couchbase Server 6.5 and later.
A line comment starts with two hyphens `--`.
The query engine ignores the two hyphens, and any text following them up to the end of the line.

A line comment may start on a new line, or in the middle of a line after other {sqlpp} statements.
A line comment may not contain line breaks.

=== Optimizer Hints

ifeval::['{page-component-version}' == '7.1']
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 7.1)_
endif::[]

In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, you can supply hints to the optimizer within a specially-formatted _hint comment_.
For further details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[].
