[abstract]
The `OVER` clause defines the window for a window function.

== Purpose

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/window-intro.adoc[tag=windows]

.Window partitions and the window frame
image::n1ql-language-reference/window-example.png[Table of query result set with numbered callouts]

// workaround for callout list with no callout references

[%hardbreaks]
➀ The query result set.
➁ Window partitions -- partitioned by `name`, ordered by `time`.
➂ The current object.
➃ The window frame -- between unbounded preceding and current object.

== Syntax

This page gives the generic syntax of window functions, window options, and the window definition.
See the {aggregatefun}[Aggregate Functions] page or {windowfun}[Window Functions] page for details of the syntax of individual functions.

[[window-function,window-function]]
=== Window Function

[subs="normal"]
----
window-function ::= <<window-function-type>> '(' <<window-function-arguments>> ')' [ <<window-function-options>> ] OVER '(' <<window-definition>> ')'
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-function.png["window-function-type '(' window-function-arguments ')' window-function-options? 'OVER' '(' window-definition ')'"]

[[window-function-type,window-function-type]]
=== Window Function Type

[subs="normal"]
----
window-function-type ::= <<aggregate-functions>> | <<window-functions>>
----

[[aggregate-functions,aggregate-functions]]
==== Aggregate Functions

See the {aggregatefun}[Aggregate Functions] page for a list of aggregate functions.

[[window-functions,window-functions]]
==== Window Functions

See the {windowfun}[Window Functions] page for a list of window functions.

[[window-function-arguments,window-function-arguments]]
=== Window Function Arguments

[subs="normal"]
----
window-function-arguments ::= [ [ {aggregate-quantifier}[aggregate-quantifier] ] {expression}[expr] [ ',' {expression}[expr] [ ',' {expression}[expr] ] ] ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-function-arguments.png[]

See the {aggregatefun}[Aggregate Functions] page or {windowfun}[Window Functions] page for details of the arguments for individual functions.

[[window-function-options,window-function-options]]
=== Window Function Options

[subs="normal"]
----
window-function-options ::= [ <<nthval-from>> ] [ <<nulls-treatment>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-function-options.png[]

Window function options cannot be used with <<aggregate-functions,aggregate functions>>.

Window function options can only be used with some <<window-function,window functions>>, as described below.

[[nthval-from,nthval-from]]
==== Nth Val From

[subs="normal"]
----
nthval-from ::= FROM ( FIRST | LAST )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/nthval-from.png[]

The *nth val from* clause determines whether the computation begins at the first or last object in the window.

This clause can only be used with the {nth-value}[NTH_VALUE()] function.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default setting is `FROM FIRST`.

[[nulls-treatment,nulls-treatment]]
==== Nulls Treatment

[subs="normal"]
----
nulls-treatment::= ( RESPECT | IGNORE ) NULLS
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/nulls-treatment.png[]

The *nulls treatment* clause determines whether NULL values are included in the computation, or ignored.
MISSING values are treated the same way as NULL values.

This clause can only be used with the {first-value}[FIRST_VALUE()], {last-value}[LAST_VALUE()], {nth-value}[NTH_VALUE()], {lag}[LAG()], and {lead}[LEAD()] functions.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, the default setting is `RESPECT NULLS`.

[[window-definition,window-definition]]
=== Window Definition

[subs="normal"]
----
window-definition ::= [ <<window-partition-clause>> ] [ <<window-order-clause>> [ <<window-frame-clause>> [ <<window-frame-exclusion>> ] ] ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-clause.png[]

The *window definition* specifies the partitioning, ordering, and framing for window functions.

[[window-partition-clause,window-partition-clause]]
==== Window Partition Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
window-partition-clause ::= PARTITION BY {expression}[expr] [ ',' {expression}[expr] ]*
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-partition-clause.png[]

The *window partition clause* groups the query results into partitions using one or more expressions.

This clause may be used with any <<window-function,window function>>, or any <<aggregate-function,aggregate function>> used as a window function.

This clause is optional.
If omitted, all the query results are grouped into single partition.

[[window-order-clause,window-order-clause]]
==== Window Order Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
window-order-clause ::= ORDER BY <<ordering-term>> [ ',' <<ordering-term>> ]*
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-order-clause.png[]

The *window order clause* determines how objects are ordered within each partition.
The window function works on objects in the order specified by this clause.

This clause may be used with any <<window-function,window function>>, or any <<aggregate-function,aggregate function>> used as a window function.

This clause is optional for some functions, and required for others.
See the {aggregatefun}[Aggregate Functions] page or {windowfun}[Window Functions] page for details of the syntax of individual functions.

If this clause is omitted, all objects are considered peers, i.e. their order is tied.
When objects in the window partition are tied, each window function behaves differently.

* The {row-number}[ROW_NUMBER()] function returns a distinct number for each object.
If objects are tied, the results may be unpredictable.

* The {rank}[RANK()], {dense-rank}[DENSE_RANK()], {percent-rank}[PERCENT_RANK()], and {cume-dist}[CUME_DIST()] functions return the same result for each object.

* For other functions, if the <<window-frame-clause,window frame>> is defined by `ROWS`, the results may be unpredictable.
If the window frame is defined by `RANGE` or `GROUPS`, the results are same for each object.

This clause may have multiple <<ordering-term,ordering terms>>.
To reduce the number of ties, add additional <<ordering-term,ordering terms>>.

[NOTE]
====
This clause does not guarantee the overall order of the query results.
To guarantee the order of the final results, use the query {orderby}[ORDER BY clause].
====

[[ordering-term,ordering-term]]
==== Ordering Term

[subs="normal"]
----
ordering-term ::= {expression}[expr] [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS ( FIRST | LAST ) ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/ordering-term.png[]

The *ordering term* specifies an ordering expression, collation, and nulls ordering.

This clause has the same syntax and semantics as the ordering term for queries.
See the {orderby}[ORDER BY clause] page for details.

[[window-frame-clause,window-frame-clause]]
=== Window Frame Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
window-frame-clause ::= ( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) <<window-frame-extent>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-frame-clause.png["( 'ROWS' | 'RANGE' | 'GROUPS' ) window-frame-extent"]

The *window frame clause* defines the window frame.

This clause can be used with all <<aggregate-functions,aggregate functions>> and some <<window-functions,window functions>> — see the descriptions of individual functions for more details.

This clause is allowed only when the <<window-order-clause,window order clause>> is present.

This clause is optional.

* If this clause is omitted and there is no <<window-order-clause,window order clause>>, the window frame is the entire partition.

* If this clause is omitted but there is a <<window-order-clause,window order clause>>, the window frame becomes all objects in the partition preceding the current object and its peers — the same as `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`.

The window frame can be defined in the following ways:

`ROWS`:: Counts the exact number of objects within the frame.
If window ordering doesn't result in unique ordering, the function may produce unpredictable results.
You can add a unique expression or more window ordering expressions to produce unique ordering.

`RANGE`:: Looks for a value offset within the frame.
The function produces deterministic results.

`GROUPS`:: Counts all groups of tied rows within the frame.
The function produces deterministic results.

[NOTE]
====
If this clause uses `RANGE` with either `_valexpr_ PRECEDING` or `_valexpr_ FOLLOWING`, the <<window-order-clause,window order clause>> must have only a single ordering term.
The ordering term expression must evaluate to a number.

If the ordering term expression does not evaluate to a number, the window frame will be empty, which means the window function will return its default value: in most cases this is NULL, except for {count}[COUNT()] or {countn}[COUNTN()], whose default value is 0.

This restriction does not apply when the window frame uses `ROWS` or `GROUPS`.
====

[TIP]
====
The `RANGE` window frame is commonly used to define a window frames based on date or time.
In JSON, dates and times are represented as a string in ISO-8601 standard.

If you want to use `RANGE` with either `_valexpr_ PRECEDING` or `_valexpr_ FOLLOWING`, and you want to use an ordering expression based on date or time, use the appropriate {datefun}[date or time function] to convert the date or time into milliseconds, then use the resulting number in the ordering expression.
====

[[window-frame-extent,window-frame-extent]]
==== Window Frame Extent

[subs="normal"]
----
window-frame-extent ::= ( UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW | {expression}[valexpr] FOLLOWING ) | BETWEEN ( UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW | {expression}[valexpr] ( PRECEDING | FOLLOWING ) ) AND ( UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING | CURRENT ROW | {expression}[valexpr] ( PRECEDING | FOLLOWING ) )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-frame-extent.png["('UNBOUNDED' 'PRECEDING' | 'CURRENT' 'ROW' | valexpr 'FOLLOWING' | 'BETWEEN' ( 'UNBOUNDED' 'PRECEDING' | 'CURRENT' 'ROW' | valexpr ( 'PRECEDING' | 'FOLLOWING' ) ) 'AND' ( 'UNBOUNDED' 'FOLLOWING' | 'CURRENT' 'ROW' | valexpr ( 'PRECEDING' | 'FOLLOWING' ) ) )"]

The *window frame extent* clause specifies the start point and end point of the window frame.
The expression before `AND` is the start point and expression after `AND` is the end point.
If `BETWEEN` is omitted, you can only specify the start point; the end point becomes `CURRENT ROW`.

The window frame end point can't be before the start point.
If this clause violates this restriction explicitly, an error will result.
If it violates this restriction implicitly, the window frame will be empty, which means the window function will return its default value: in most cases this is NULL, except for {count}[COUNT()] or {countn}[COUNTN()], whose default value is 0.

Window frame extents that result in an explicit violation are:

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND _valexpr_ PRECEDING`

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN _valexpr_ FOLLOWING AND _valexpr_ PRECEDING`

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN _valexpr_ FOLLOWING AND CURRENT ROW`

Window frame extents that result in an implicit violation are:

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND _valexpr_ PRECEDING` — if `_valexpr_` is too high, some objects may generate an empty window frame.

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN _valexpr_ PRECEDING AND _valexpr_ PRECEDING` — if the second `_valexpr_` is greater than or equal to the first `_valexpr_`, all result sets will generate an empty window frame.

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN _valexpr_ FOLLOWING AND _valexpr_ FOLLOWING` — if the first `_valexpr_` is greater than or equal to the second `_valexpr_`, all result sets will generate an empty window frame.

* `( ROWS | RANGE | GROUPS ) BETWEEN _valexpr_ FOLLOWING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` — if `_valexpr_` is too high, some objects may generate an empty window frame.

* If the <<window-frame-exclusion,window frame exclusion clause>> is present, any window frame specification may result in empty window frame.

The `_valexpr_` must be a positive constant or an expression that evaluates as a positive number.
For `ROWS` or `GROUPS`, the `_valexpr_` must be an integer.

[[window-frame-exclusion,window-frame-exclusion]]
==== Window Frame Exclusion

[subs="normal"]
----
window-frame-exclusion ::= EXCLUDE ( CURRENT ROW | GROUP | TIES | NO OTHERS )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/window-frame-exclusion.png[]

The *window frame exclusion clause* enables you to exclude specified objects from the window frame.

This clause can be used with all <<aggregate-functions,aggregate functions>> and some <<window-functions,window functions>> — see the descriptions of individual functions for more details.

This clause is allowed only when the <<window-frame-clause,window frame clause>> is present.

This clause is optional.
If this clause is omitted, the default is no exclusion — the same as `EXCLUDE NO OTHERS`.

`EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW`:: If the current object is still part of the window frame, it is removed from the window frame.

`EXCLUDE GROUP`:: The current object and any peers of the current object are removed from the window frame.

`EXCLUDE TIES`:: Any peers of the current object, but not the current object itself, are removed from the window frame.

`EXCLUDE NO OTHERS`:: No additional objects are removed from the window frame.

If the current object is already removed from the window frame, then it remains removed from the window frame.
