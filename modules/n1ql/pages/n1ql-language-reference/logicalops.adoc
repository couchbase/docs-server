= Logical Operators
:description: Logical terms let you combine other expressions using xref:n1ql-language-reference/booleanlogic.adoc[Boolean logic].

{description}
N1QL provides the following logical operators:

* AND
* OR
* NOT

In N1QL, logical operators have their usual meaning.
However, in any of these expressions, if any operand is MISSING, the value of the expression is MISSING.
If any operand is NULL and no operand is MISSING, the value of the expression is NULL.
See the description of the <<or-operator>> operator for an exception to this rule.

[#logical-op-and]
== AND

----
condition AND condition
----

AND evaluates to TRUE only if both conditions are TRUE.

[#or-operator]
== OR

----
condition OR condition
----

OR evaluates to TRUE if one of the conditions is TRUE.

.OR Truth Table

| | TRUE | FALSE

NOTE: The OR operator has an exception to the general rule that operators return MISSING or NULL if their operands are MISSING or NULL.
If one operand of the OR operator is TRUE and the other operand is MISSING or NULL, the OR operator returns TRUE.

[#logical-op-not]
== NOT

----
NOT condition
----

NOT evaluates to TRUE if the expression does not match the condition.
