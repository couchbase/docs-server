[abstract]
The `DROP COLLECTION` statement enables you to delete a named collection from a scope.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
drop-collection ::= DROP COLLECTION [ [ _namespace_ ':' ] _bucket_ '.' _scope_ '.' ] _collection_
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/drop-collection.png["'DROP' 'COLLECTION' ( ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope '.' )? collection"]

namespace::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-heirarchy[namespace] of the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.

scope::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the scope which contains the collection you want to delete.

collection::
(Required) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the name of the collection that you want to delete.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name, the scope name, or the collection name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

== Usage

To specify the collection, you may include its [def]_full path_, containing the namespace, bucket, and scope; or a [def]_relative path_, containing just the bucket and scope; or you may specify just the collection name without a path.

When you specify a collection name without a path, you must set the xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#query_context[query_context] request-level parameter to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.
If you specify a collection name by itself without setting a valid query context, an error is generated.

== Examples

.Delete collection with full path
====
This statement deletes a collection called `cities` in the `places` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP COLLECTION `travel-sample`.places.cities
----
====

.Delete collection with query context
====
This statement deletes a collection called `countries` in the `places` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

.Set the query context
[source,shell]
----
cbq> \SET -query_context "travel-sample.places";
----

.Delete the collection
[source,shell]
----
cbq> DROP COLLECTION countries;
----
====
