== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
drop-collection ::= DROP COLLECTION [ [ _namespace_ ':' ] _bucket_ '.' _scope_ '.' ] _collection_
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/drop-collection.png["'DROP' 'COLLECTION' ( ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope '.' )? collection"]

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.

scope::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the scope which contains the collection you want to delete.

collection::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the collection that you want to delete.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name, the scope name, or the collection name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

== Usage

To specify the collection, you may do one of the following:

* Include its [def]_full path_, containing the namespace, bucket, and scope, followed by the collection name;
* Include a [def]_relative path_, containing just the bucket and scope, followed by the connection name;
* Specify just the collection name without a path.

When you specify a collection name without a path, you must set the {query-context}[query context] to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.
If you specify a collection name by itself without setting a valid query context, an error is generated.

== Examples

.Delete collection with full path
====
This statement deletes a collection called `city` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP COLLECTION `travel-sample`.inventory.city
----
====

[discrete]
===== Query Context

For the following example, you must first set the {query-context}[query context] to `{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory`, using the Query Workbench or the cbq shell.

[{tabs}]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
Use the query context drop-down menu to select `travel-sample.inventory`.

--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
\SET -query_context travel-sample.inventory;
----
--
====

.Delete collection with query context
====
Assuming that the query context is set, this statement deletes a collection called `country` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP COLLECTION country;
----
====
