[abstract]
The `DROP COLLECTION` statement enables you to delete a named collection from a scope.

== Syntax

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket which contains the collection you want to delete.

scope::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the scope which contains the collection you want to delete.

collection::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the collection that you want to delete.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name, the scope name, or the collection name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

[[location]]
=== Specifying the Location

To specify the location of the collection, you may do one of the following:

* Include its [def]_full path_, containing the namespace, bucket, and scope, followed by the collection name;
* Include a [def]_relative path_, containing just the bucket and scope, followed by the connection name;
* Specify just the collection name without a path.

When you specify a collection name without a path, you must set the {query-context}[query context] to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.
If you specify a collection name by itself without setting a valid query context, an error is generated.

[[if-exists]]
=== IF EXISTS Clause

The optional `IF EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully when the specified collection doesn't exist.
If the collection does not exist within the specified scope, then:

* If this clause is not present, an error is generated.

* If this clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Examples

.Delete collection with full path
====
This statement deletes a collection called `city` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP COLLECTION `travel-sample`.inventory.city
----
====

.Delete collection with query context
====
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=example]

Assuming that the query context is set, this statement deletes a collection called `country` in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP COLLECTION country;
----
