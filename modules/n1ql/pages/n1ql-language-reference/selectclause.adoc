[abstract]
The `SELECT` clause determines the result set.

[#section_Purpose]
== Purpose

In a `SELECT` statement, the `SELECT` clause determines the projection (result set).

[#section_Prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

For you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

=== Optimizer Hints

ifeval::['{page-component-version}' == '7.1']
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 7.1)_
endif::[]

In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, you can supply hints to the optimizer within a specially-formatted hint comment.
For further details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[].

[#sec_Arguments]
=== Projection

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=projection]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/projection.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

The projection consists of an optional `ALL` or `DISTINCT` <<all-distinct,quantifier>>, followed by one of the following alternatives:

* One or more <<result-expr,result expressions>>, separated by commas.
* A single <<raw-element-value,raw expression>>, including a <<field-expr,select expression>> and an optional <<alias,alias>>.

[[all-distinct]]
==== ALL / DISTINCT

(Optional; default is ALL.)

SELECT ALL retrieves all of the data specified and will result in all of the specified columns, including all duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicate result objects from the query's result set.

NOTE: The DISTINCT clause is not blocking in nature, since it streams the input and produces the output in parallel, while consuming less memory.

In general, `SELECT ALL` results in more returned documents than `SELECT DISTINCT` due to [.code]``DISTINCT``'s extra step of removing duplicates.
Since `DISTINCT` is purely run in memory, it executes quickly, making the overhead of removing duplicates more noticeable as your recordset gets larger.
Refer to <<ex-all-distinct>>.

[[result-expr]]
==== Result Expression

[source#path,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=path]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/path.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

The result expression may contain one of the following alternatives:

* A <<keyspace-name,star expression>>, preceded by an optional path.
* A <<field-expression,select expression>>, including an optional <<alias,alias>>.

[[raw-element-value]]
==== RAW / ELEMENT / VALUE

(Optional; RAW and ELEMENT and VALUE are synonyms.)

When you specify one or more <<result-expr,result expressions>> in the query projection, each result is wrapped in an object, and an implicit or explicit <<alias,alias>> is given for each result expression.
This extra layer might not be desirable, since it requires extra output parsing.

SELECT RAW reduces the amount of data returned by eliminating the field attribute.
The RAW qualifier specifies that the expression that follows should not be wrapped in an object, and the alias for that expression should be suppressed, as shown in <<ex-raw-expr>> and <<ex-raw-field>>.

The RAW qualifier only enables you to specify a single <<field-expression,select expression>>.
You cannot use the RAW qualifier with a <<keyspace-name,star expression>> or with multiple select expressions.

[[keyspace-name]]
==== Star Expression ({asterisk})

The star expression `{asterisk}` enables you to select _all_ the fields from the source specified by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM clause].

The star expression may be preceded by a xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[path], to select all the nested fields from within an array.

[NOTE]
====
Omitting the keyspace name before a star expression adds the keyspace name to the result set; whereas if you include the keyspace name before a star expression, the keyspace name will not appear in the result set.
Refer to <<ex-star>>.
====

[[field-expression]]
==== Select Expression

The select expression is any expression that evaluates to a field to be included in the query's result set.
At its simplest, this may be the name of a field in the data source, such as `id`, `airline`, or `stops`.
Refer to <<ex-field>>.

The select expression may include a xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[path], to select a nested field from within an array, such as `schedule[0].day`.
Refer to <<ex-path>>.

If no field name is specified, the select expression allows you to perform calculations, such as `SELECT 10+20 AS Total;` or any other {sqlpp} expression.
For details with examples, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[{sqlpp} Expressions].

[[alias]]
==== AS Alias

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=alias]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/alias.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

A temporary name of a keyspace name or field name to make names more readable or unique.
Refer to <<ex-alias>>.

(((implicit alias)))
If you do not explicitly give a field an alias, it is given an _implicit alias_.

* For a field, the implicit alias is the same as the name of the field in the input.
* For a nested path, the implicit alias is defined as the last component in the path.
* For any expression which does not refer to a field, the implicit alias is a dollar sign followed by a number, based on the position of the expression in the projection; for example, `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

An implicit or explicit alias is returned in the result set, unless you suppress it using the <<raw-element-value,RAW keyword>>.

[#sec_BestPractices]
== Best Practices

When possible, explicitly list all fields you want in your result set instead of using a star expression `{asterisk}` to select all fields, since the `{asterisk}` requires an extra trip over your network -- one to get the list of field names and one to select the fields.

[[ex-all-distinct]]
.SELECT ALL and SELECT DISTINCT
====
Note that the queries in this example may take some time to run.

[cols=2*a]
|===
|
[[q1]]
.Query 1
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT ALL city FROM landmark;
----

slightly slower
|
[[q2]]
.Query 2
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM landmark;
----

slightly faster
|===

When used on a field such as `city`, which contains non-unique values, `SELECT DISTINCT` reduces the recordset to a small fraction of its original size; and while removing so many of the documents takes time, projecting the remaining small fraction is actually slightly faster than the overhead of removing duplicates.

[cols=2*a]
|===
|
[[q3]]
.Query 3
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT ALL META().id FROM landmark;
----

much faster
|
[[q4]]
.Query 4
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT DISTINCT META().id FROM landmark;
----

much slower
|===

On the other extreme, when used on a field such as `META().id` which contains only unique values, `SELECT DISTINCT` does not reduce the recordset at all, and the overhead of looking for duplicates is wasted effort.
In this case, `SELECT DISTINCT` takes about twice as long to execute as `SELECT ALL`.
