[#section_Purpose]
== Purpose

In a `SELECT` statement, the `SELECT` clause determines the projection (result set).

[#section_Prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

For you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

[#sec_Arguments]
=== ALL / DISTINCT

(Optional; default is ALL.)

SELECT ALL retrieves all of the data specified and will result in all of the specified columns, including all duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicate result objects from the query's result set.

NOTE: Since Couchbase Server 4.5.1, the DISTINCT clause is no longer blocking in nature since it streams the input and produces the output in-parallel, while consuming less memory.

In general, `SELECT ALL` results in more returned documents than `SELECT DISTINCT` due to [.code]``DISTINCT``'s extra step of removing duplicates.
Since `DISTINCT` is purely run in memory, it executes quickly, making the overhead of removing duplicates more noticeable as your recordset gets larger.

In the below table,

* <<q1>>'s `SELECT DISTINCT` reduces the recordset to a small fraction of its original size; and while removing so many of the documents takes time, projecting the remaining small fraction is actually slightly faster than the overhead of removing duplicates.
* On the other extreme, <<q2>>'s `SELECT DISTINCT` does not reduce the recordset at all since `META().id` is already unique, and thus projects the entire original recordset and shows the maximum overhead of about twice as long to execute than `SELECT ALL`.

----

image::n1ql-language-reference/result-expr.png["( path '.' )? '*' | expr ( 'AS'? alias )?"]

----
path ::= _identifier_ [ '[' _expr_ ']' ]* [ '.' <<path,path>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/path.png["'identifier ('[' expr ']')* ( '.' path )?"]

One or more expressions that evaluate to one or more field names to be in the result set.

If no field name is specified, the input for the query is a single empty object that allows you to perform calculations with the `SELECT` statement, such as `SELECT 10+20 AS Total;` or other N1QL expression.

For details with examples, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[N1QL Expressions].

=== RAW / ELEMENT / VALUE

(Optional; RAW and ELEMENT and VALUE are synonyms.)

SELECT RAW reduces the amount of data returned by eliminating the field attribute.

There are times in which this extra layer might not be desirable since it requires extra output parsing.
So the RAW qualifier specifies that the expression that follows not to be qualified, as shown in the next example.

=== Keyspace Name

(Optional; if the keyspace is unspecified in the SELECT clause, it will be taken from the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM clause].)

The name of the keyspace or keyspaces used, separated by a comma.

Keyspaces map to buckets in Couchbase Server.
A keyspace is a set of documents that may vary in structure, and is a unit of authorization and resource allocation.

[NOTE]
====
When specifying the keyspace name in `SELECT keyspace_name.*` for all fields, the keyspace name will not appear in the result set; whereas not specifying the keyspace name in `SELECT * FROM keyspace_name` adds the keyspace name to the result set.

=== Field Expression

The name of the field or fields, separated by a comma, to be in the query's result set, such as:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT id, airline, stops FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="route";
----
====

To use a field within an array, use `[0]` after the array name, followed by a period and the field name, such as:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT schedule[0].day FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="route";
----
====

[[alias]]
=== AS Alias

[subs="normal"]
----
alias ::= _identifier_
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/alias.png["identifier"]

A temporary name of a keyspace name or field name to make names more readable or unique, such as:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT schedule[0].day AS Weekday
----
====

[#sec_BestPractices]
== Best Practices

When possible, explicitly list all fields you want in your result set instead of the `{asterisk}` to select all fields, since the `{asterisk}` requires an extra trip over your network (one to get the list of field names and one to select the field names).
