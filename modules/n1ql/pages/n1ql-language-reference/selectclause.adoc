[abstract]
The `SELECT` clause determines the result set.

[#section_Purpose]
== Purpose

In a `SELECT` statement, the `SELECT` clause determines the projection (result set).

[#section_Prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

For you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

In Couchbase Server 7.1 and later, you can supply hints to the optimizer within a specially-formatted hint comment.

=== Projection

[source,ebnf]

image::n1ql-language-reference/projection.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

The projection consists of an optional `ALL` or `DISTINCT` <<all-distinct,quantifier>>, followed by one of the following alternatives:

* One or more <<result-expr,result expressions>>, separated by commas.
* A single <<raw-element-value,raw expression>>, including a <<field-expr,field expression>> and an optional <<alias,alias>>.

[[all-distinct]]
==== ALL / DISTINCT

(Optional; default is ALL.)

SELECT ALL retrieves all of the data specified and will result in all of the specified columns, including all duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicate result objects from the query's result set.

NOTE: The DISTINCT clause is not blocking in nature, since it streams the input and produces the output in parallel, while consuming less memory.

In general, `SELECT ALL` results in more returned documents than `SELECT DISTINCT` due to [.code]``DISTINCT``'s extra step of removing duplicates.
Since `DISTINCT` is purely run in memory, it executes quickly, making the overhead of removing duplicates more noticeable as your recordset gets larger.

In the below table,

* <<q1>>'s `SELECT DISTINCT` reduces the recordset to a small fraction of its original size; and while removing so many of the documents takes time, projecting the remaining small fraction is actually slightly faster than the overhead of removing duplicates.
* On the other extreme, <<q2>>'s `SELECT DISTINCT` does not reduce the recordset at all since `META().id` is already unique, and thus projects the entire original recordset and shows the maximum overhead of about twice as long to execute than `SELECT ALL`.

(Optional; RAW and ELEMENT and VALUE are synonyms.)

SELECT RAW reduces the amount of data returned by eliminating the field attribute.

There are times in which this extra layer might not be desirable since it requires extra output parsing.
So the RAW qualifier specifies that the expression that follows not to be qualified, as shown in the next example.

[[keyspace-name]]
==== Star Expression ({asterisk})

The star expression `{asterisk}` enables you to select _all_ the fields from the source specified by the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM clause].

The star expression may be preceded by a xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[path], to select all the nested fields from within an array.

[NOTE]
====
Not including the keyspace name before a star expression or field expression, as in <<q3>>, adds the keyspace name to the result set; whereas if you include the keyspace name before a star expression or field expression, as in <<q4>> and <<q5>>, the keyspace name will not appear in the result set.

[[field-expression]]
==== Field Expression

The field expression is any expression that evaluates to a field in the result set.
At its simplest, this may be the name of a field to be included in the query's result set.
For example:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT id, airline, stops FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route;
----
====

The field expression may include a xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/nestedops.adoc[path], to select a nested field from within an array.
For example:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT schedule[0].day FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route;
----
====

If no field name is specified, the field expression allows you to perform calculations with the `SELECT` statement, such as `SELECT 10+20 AS Total;` or any other N1QL expression.

For details with examples, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#N1QL_Expressions[N1QL Expressions].

[[alias]]
==== AS Alias

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=alias]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/alias.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

A temporary name of a keyspace name or field name to make names more readable or unique, such as:

====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT schedule[0].day AS Weekday FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route;
----
====

(((implicit alias)))
If you do not explicitly give a field an alias, it is given an _implicit alias_ in the result set.

* For a field, the implicit alias is the same as the name of the field in the input.
* For a nested path, the implicit alias is defined as the last component in the path.
* For any expression which does not refer to a field, the implicit alias is a dollar sign followed by a number, based on the position of the expression in the projection; for example, `$1`, `$2`, and so on.

[#sec_BestPractices]
== Best Practices

When possible, explicitly list all fields you want in your result set instead of using a star expression `{asterisk}` to select all fields, since the `{asterisk}` requires an extra trip over your network -- one to get the list of field names and one to select the fields.
