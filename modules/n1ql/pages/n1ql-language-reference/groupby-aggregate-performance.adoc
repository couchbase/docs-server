[#Overview]
== Overview

This features improves performance of N1QL queries with aggregations and GROUP BY execution.

After the optimizer selects an index for a query block, it attempts the two optimizations below:

* Pagination optimization, by pushing the OFFSET and LIMIT parameters to the index scan.
* Grouping and aggregation pushdown to the indexer (introduced in Couchbase 5.5).

Prior to Couchbase 5.5, even when a query with aggregate and/or GROUP BY is covered by an index, the query fetched all relevant data from the indexer and group the data within the query engine.
With this enhancement, the query intelligently requests the indexer to perform grouping and aggregation in addition to range scan.
The Indexer has been enhanced to perform grouping, COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG(), and related operations.

This requires no changes to the user query, but a good index design to cover the query and order the keys is required.
Not every query will benefit from this optimization, and not every index can accelerate every grouping and aggregation.
Understanding the right patterns will help you to design your indexes and queries.
Aggregate Pushdown to the global secondary index is supported on both storage engines: Standard GSI and Memory Optimized GSI (MOI).

This reduction step of performing the GROUP BY and Aggregation on the indexer reduces the amount of data transfer and disk I/O, resulting in:

* Improved query response time
* Improved resource utilization
* Low latency
* High scalability
* Low TCO

For example, let's compare the previous vs.
current performance of using GROUP BY and examine the EXPLAIN plan of the following query that is defined in the Couchbase `travel-sample` index:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX `def_type` ON `travel-sample`(`type`)
----

Consider the query:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT type, COUNT(type)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY type;
----

Before Couchbase version 5.5, this query engine fetched relevant data from the indexer and group the data within the query engine and then aggregate.
This simple query takes about 250 ms.

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_Ex0_QP_before55.png[]

Now, in Couchbase version 5.5, this query use the same `def_type` index, but executes in under 70 ms.
In the explain below, you can see fewer steps and the lack of the grouping step after the index scan because the index scan step does the grouping and aggregation as well.

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_Ex0_QP_after55.png[]

As the data and query complexity grows, the performance benefit (both latency and throughput) will grow as well.

For example, consider the query:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT type, COUNT(type)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY type;
----

The text explain plan shows the accelerated aggregation details.

Here’s is how this query executes when the indexer executes the GROUP BY and aggregation.
The query engine does not fetch any data from the data service (KV service), as shown below:

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_55execution.png[,700]

For your reference, this is how the same query executed before 5.5.

== Examples for Indexer GROUP BY and Aggregation

Let’s consider a composite index to explore some scenarios:

.Example A
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_a ON `travel-sample` (geo.alt, geo.lat, geo.lon, id) WHERE type = "airport"
----

Let’s consider sample queries that can benefit from this optimization and the queries that cannot.

Positive Case examples of queries that use indexing grouping and aggregation::

* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt > 10 AND type="airport";]`
* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(geo.alt) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt BETWEEN 10 AND 30 AND type = "airport";]`
* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(geo.lat) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt BETWEEN 10 AND 30 AND geo.lat = 40 AND type = "airport";]`
* `pass:c[SELECT geo.alt, AVG(id), SUM(id), COUNT(geo.alt), MIN (geo.lon), MAX(ABS(geo.lon)) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt > 100 AND type = "airport" GROUP BY geo.alt;]`
* `pass:c[SELECT lat_count, SUM(id) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt > 100 AND type = "airport" GROUP BY geo.alt LETTING lat_count = COUNT(geo.lat) HAVING lat_count > 1;]`
* `pass:c[SELECT AVG(DISTINCT geo.lat) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt > 100 AND type = "airport" GROUP BY geo.alt;]`

Negative Case examples::

* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.lat > 20 AND type = "airport";]`
+
+
This query has no predicate on the leading key `geo.alt`.
The index `idx_a` cannot be used.

* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `travel-sample`;]`
+
+
This query has no predicate at all.

* `pass:c[SELECT COUNT(v1) FROM `travel-sample` LET v1 = ROUND(geo.lat) WHERE geo.lat > 10 AND type = "airport";]`
+
+
The aggregate depends on `LET` variable.

* `pass:c[SELECT ARRAY_AGG(geo.alt) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE geo.alt > 10 AND type = "airport";]`
+
+
`ARRAY_AGG` is not supported.

=== Positive query examples with GROUP BY on leading index keys

Consider the following index:

.Example B
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_b ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt, geo.lat, geo.lon, id)
----

In the following query, the GROUP BY keys `(geo.alt, geo.lat)` are the leading keys of the index, so the index is naturally ordered and grouped by the order of the index key definition.
Therefore, the query below is suitable for indexer to handle grouping and aggregation.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT geo.alt, geo.lat, SUM(geo.lon), AVG(id), COUNT(DISTINCT geo.lon)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE geo.alt BETWEEN 10 AND 30
AND type = "airport"
GROUP BY geo.alt, geo.lat
HAVING SUM(geo.lon) > 1000;
----

Here's the executed query plan showing that index scan handled grouping and aggregation:

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_ExB_Plan.png[,70%]

=== Positive query examples with GROUP BY on non-leading index keys

Consider the following index and query:

.Example C
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_c ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt, geo.lat, geo.lon, id)
 WHERE type = "airport"

SELECT geo.lat, id, SUM(geo.lon)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE geo.alt BETWEEN 10 AND 30
AND type = "airport"
GROUP BY geo.lat, id
HAVING SUM(geo.lon) > 1000;
----

The following is a bottom-up rendering of the execution plan for easier viewing.
In this case, the indexer sends partial group aggregation, which the query merges to create the final group and aggregation.
In this scenario (when the grouping is on non-leading keys), any query with aggregation and DISTINCT modifier cannot be accelerated by the indexer, such as `COUNT(DISTINCT id)`.

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_ExC_Plan.png[,50%]

=== Positive query examples on array indexes with GROUP BY on leading index keys

Consider the following index and query:

.Example D
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_d ON `travel-sample` (geo.lat, geo.lon, DISTINCT public_likes, id) WHERE type = "hotel"

SELECT geo.lat, geo.lon, SUM(id), AVG(id)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE geo.lat BETWEEN 10 AND 30
 AND geo.lon > 50
 AND type = "hotel"
 AND ANY v IN public_likes SATISFIES  v = “%a%” END
GROUP BY geo.lat, geo.lon
HAVING SUM(id) > 100;
----

In this case, the predicates are on the leading keys up to and including the array key.
Therefore, indexer can efficiently do the grouping as seen by the optimal plan below.
It’s important to note the array index key is created with a `DISTINCT` modifier (not the `ALL` modifier) to get this optimization and that the `SATISFIES` clause in the `ANY` predicate must be that of equality (that is, `v = “%a%”`).

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_ExD_Plan.png[,70%]

On the other hand, if there’s a predicate missing on `geo.lon` -- which is prior to the array key -- while using the same `idx_d` index as above, then the grouping is done by the old method:

.Example D2
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT geo.lat, geo.lon, SUM(id), AVG(id)
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE geo.lat BETWEEN 10 AND 30
 AND type = "hotel"
 AND ANY v IN public_likes SATISFIES  v = “%a%” END
GROUP BY geo.lat, geo.lon
HAVING SUM(id) > 100;
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_ExD2_Plan.png[]

Consider the index and query:

.Example E
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_e ON `travel-sample` (ALL public_likes, geo.lat, geo.lon, id) WHERE type = "hotel"

SELECT un, t.geo.lat, COUNT(un), AVG(t.geo.lat)
FROM `travel-sample` AS t
 UNNEST t.public_likes AS un
WHERE un > "J"
AND t.type = "hotel"
GROUP BY un, t.geo.lat;
----

In this case, the `UNNEST` operation can use the index because the leading `ALL` array key is the array being unwound.
Note, the unwound operation repeats the parent document (`travel-sample`) and the `t.geo.lat` reference would have duplicates compared to the original `travel-sample` documents.

image::n1ql-language-reference/GBAP_ExE_Plan.png[,50%]

== Query Qualification and Pushdown

Not every GROUP BY and aggregate query can be handled by the indexer.
Following are some simple rules that will help you to write the proper queries and design the required indexes to get the most of this feature.

The following are necessary in order for an indexer to execute GROUP BY and aggregates:

* All the query predicates are able to convert into ranges and able to push to indexer.
* The whole query must be covered by an index.
 ** For a query to be covered by an index, every attribute referenced in the query should be in one index.
 ** Query should not have operations such as joins, subquery, or derived table queries.
* GROUP BY keys and Aggregate expressions must be one of the following:
 ** Index keys or document key
 ** An expression based on index keys or document key
* GROUP BY and aggregate expressions must be simple.

== Scenarios for Group By and Aggregation

Like any feature in a query language, there are subtle variations between each query and index that affects this optimization.
We use the `travel-sample` dataset to illustrate both positive and negative use cases.

The following table lists the scenarios and requirements for queries to request the indexer to do the grouping and acceleration.
When the requirements are unmet, the query will fetch the relevant data and then do the grouping and acceleration as usual.
No application changes are necessary.
The query plan generated reflects this decision.

GROUP BY Scenarios::

. <<group-by-on-leading-keys>>
. <<group-by-on-non-leading-keys>>
. <<group-by-keys-in-different-order>>
. <<group-by-on-expression>>
. <<heterogeneous-data-types>>
. <<group-by-meta-id>>
. <<limit-with-group-by>>
. <<offset-with-group-by>>

Aggregate Scenarios::

. <<aggregate-without-group-by>>
. <<expression-in-aggregate-function>>
. <<sum-count-min-max-avg>>
. <<distinct-aggregates>>
. <<having-with-aggregate-function>>
. <<letting-with-aggregate-function>>

[[group-by-on-leading-keys]]
=== GROUP BY on leading keys

One of the common cases is to have both predicates and GROUP BY on leading keys of the index.
First create the index so that the query is covered by the index.
You can then think about the order of the keys.

The query requires a predicate on leading keys to consider an index.
The simplest predicate is `IS NOT MISSING`.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_expr ON Keyspace_ref (a, b, c);

SELECT a, b, Aggregate_Function(c)  -- <1>
FROM Keyspace_ref
WHERE a IS NOT MISSING -- <2>
GROUP BY a, b;
----

<1> Where `Aggregate_Function(c)` is `MIN(c)`, `MAX(c)`, `COUNT(c)`, or `SUM(c)`
<2> 1st index field must be in a WHERE clause

[[ex1]]
.List the cities with the landmarks with the highest latitude
====
Use the `MAX()` aggregate to find the highest landmark latitude in each state, group the results by `country` and `state`, and then sort in reverse order by the highest latitudes per `state`.

.Index
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx1 ON `travel-sample`(country, state, geo.lat)
WHERE type="landmark";
----

.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT country, state, MAX(ROUND(geo.lat)) AS Max_Latitude
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE country IS NOT MISSING
AND type = "landmark"
GROUP BY country, state
ORDER BY Max_Latitude DESC;
----

In this query, we need to give the predicate `country IS NOT MISSING` (or any WHERE clause) to ensure this index is selected for the query.
Without a matching predicate, the query will use the primary index.

                }
              ]
            },
...
----

The EXPLAIN Plan shows that `GROUP BY` is executed by the indexer.
This is detailed in <<table_bw2_nrf_ycb>>.
====

[[group-by-on-non-leading-keys]]
=== GROUP BY on non-leading keys

When using GROUP BY on a non-leading key:

* The indexer will return _pre-aggregated_ results.
* Results can have duplicate or out-of-order groups.
The N1QL indexer will do 2nd level of aggregation and compute the final result.
* The N1QL indexer can pushdown only if the leading key has a predicate.

To use Aggregate Pushdown, use the following syntax for the index and query statements:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_expr ON Keyspace_ref (a, b, c);
----

.Syntax A
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT Aggregate_Function(a), b, Aggregate_Function(c)
FROM Keyspace_ref
WHERE a IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY b;
----

----
SELECT Aggregate_Function(a), Aggregate_Function(b), c
FROM Keyspace_ref
WHERE a IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY c;
----

[[ex2-a]]
.List the states with their total number of landmarks and the lowest latitude of any landmark

[[group-by-on-expression]]
=== GROUP BY on expression

When grouping on an expression or operation, the indexer will return pre-aggregated results whenever the GROUP BY and leading index keys are not an exact match.

To use Aggregate Pushdown and avoid pre-aggregated results, use one of the two following syntaxes for the index and query statements:

.Syntax A: Field with an expression -- GROUP BY and Index keys match
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_expr ON Keyspace_ref(a+b, b, c);

SELECT Aggregate_Function(c)
FROM Keyspace_ref
WHERE a IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY a+b;
----

.Syntax B: Operation on a field -- GROUP BY and Index keys match
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_operation ON Keyspace_ref (LOWER(a), b, c);

SELECT Aggregate_Function(c)
FROM Keyspace_ref
WHERE a IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY LOWER(a);
----

For comparison, the below index and query combination will yield pre-aggregated results.

.Pre-aggregated Syntax -- the GROUP BY and Index keys don't match

CREATE INDEX idx_operation ON Keyspace_ref (a, b, c);

[[sum-count-min-max-avg]]
=== SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, or AVG Aggregate functions

Currently, the only aggregate functions that are supported are SUM(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), and AVG() with or without the DISTINCT modifier.

To use Aggregate Pushdown, use the below syntax for the index and query statement:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_expr ON named_keyspace_ref (a,b,c,d);

SELECT Aggregate_Function(a), Aggregate_Function(b),
       Aggregate_Function(c), Aggregate_Function(d)

WHERE a IS NOT MISSING
GROUP BY a;

[[distinct-aggregates]]
=== DISTINCT aggregates

There are four cases when DISTINCT aggregates can use this feature:

. If the DISTINCT aggregate is on the leading GROUP BY key(s).
. If the DISTINCT aggregate is on the leading GROUP By key(s) + 1 (the immediate next key).
. If the DISTINCT aggregate is on a constant expression (GROUP BY can be on any key).
. If there is no GROUP BY and the DISTINCT aggregate is on the first key only or in a constant expression.

To use Aggregate Pushdown, use one of the following syntaxes of the index and query statements:

==== Case 1

If the DISTINCT aggregate is on the leading GROUP BY key(s).

== Limitations

The following are currently not supported and not pushed to the indexer:

* `HAVING` or `LETTING` clauses, unless there is an aggregate function inside.
* `ORDER BY` clauses.
* `ARRAY_AGG()` or any facility to add new Aggregate function, such as Median.
* `LIMIT` pushdown with `GROUP BY` on non-leading keys.
* `OFFSET` pushdown with `GROUP BY` on non-leading keys.
* A subquery in a `GROUP BY` or Aggregate pushdown.

Consider the example:

[source,n1ql]
----
EXPLAIN SELECT type, COUNT(type)

In the query plan:

* `pass:c[plan.`~children`[0].covers]` shows that the index covers the query.
* `pass:c[plan.`~children`[0].index_group_aggs]` shows the aggregation and groupings done by the indexer.
* `index_group_aggs` object has details on the aggregate, index key position, expression dependency, and group expressions handled by the indexer.
This object is present in the plan only when the indexer handles the grouping and aggregation.

Key Position to use the Index expr or the query expr.

* A value > -1 means the group key exactly matches the corresponding index keys, where 0 is the 1st index key.
* A value of -1 means the group key does not match the index key and uses the query expression instead.
| `-1`

(because the index has the field `geo.lat` but the query adds the `ROUND()` function to `geo.lat`)

| `depends`
| List of index key positions the GROUP BY expression depends on, starting with 0.
| `0, 1, 2`

| `group`
| Array of GROUP BY objects, and each object represents one group key.
The absence of this item means there is no GROUP BY clause.
| `group`

| `+... depends+`
| Index key position of a single GROUP BY expression, starting with 0.
| `0`

(because it's the 1st GROUP BY key)

| `+... expr+`
| Single GROUP BY expression.
| `pass:c[`travel-sample`.`country`]`

| `+... id+`
| Unique ID given internally and will be used in `index_projection.`
| `0`

Key Position to use the Index expr or the query expr.

* A value > -1 means the group key exactly matches the corresponding index keys, where 0 is the 1st index key.
* A value of -1 means the group key does not match the index key and uses the query expression instead.
| `0`

(because it matches the first key in the index expression)
