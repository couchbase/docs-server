== Purpose

The `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement enables you to begin a sequence of statements as an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[N1QL Support for Couchbase Transactions] for further information.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-restrictions.adoc[]

NOTE: You can also specify a single DML statement as an ACID transaction by setting the {tximplicit}[tximplicit] query parameter.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
begin-transaction ::= ( BEGIN | START ) ( WORK | TRAN | TRANSACTION )
                      [ ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/begin-transaction.png["( 'BEGIN' | 'START' ) ( 'WORK' | 'TRAN' | 'TRANSACTION' ) ( 'ISOLATION' 'LEVEL' 'READ' 'COMMITTED' )?"]

The `BEGIN` and `START` keywords are synonyms.
The statement must begin with one of these keywords.

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
The statement must contain one of these keywords.

=== Transaction Settings

Currently, the only available transaction setting is "isolation level read committed".
This setting is enabled by default.
The `ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED` keywords are therefore optional and may be omitted.

== Return Value

The statement returns an object containing the following property.

txid::
The transaction ID.

If you are using the Query REST API, you must set the {txid}[txid] query parameter to specify the transaction ID for any subsequent statements that form part of the same transaction.

If you are using the Query Workbench, you don't need to specify the transaction ID for any statements that form a part of the same transaction within a multi-statement request.
If you start a transaction within a multi-statement request, all statements within the request are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.

Similarly, if you are using the cbq shell, you don't need to specify the transaction ID for any statements that form a part of the same transaction.
Once you have started a transaction, all statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.
footnote:[You must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above to use the automatic transaction ID functionality.]

== Example

If you want to try this example, first refer to {preparation}[Preparation] to set up your environment.
