[abstract]
The `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement enables you to begin a transaction.

== Purpose

The `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement enables you to begin a sequence of statements as an ACID transaction.
Refer to {transactions}[Transactions] for further information.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/transaction-restrictions.adoc[]

NOTE: You can also specify a single DML statement as an ACID transaction by setting the {tximplicit}[tximplicit] query parameter.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
begin-transaction ::= ( BEGIN | START ) ( WORK | TRAN | TRANSACTION ) [ ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/begin-transaction.png["( 'BEGIN' | 'START' ) ( 'WORK' | 'TRAN' | 'TRANSACTION' ) ( 'ISOLATION' 'LEVEL' 'READ' 'COMMITTED' )?"]

The `BEGIN` and `START` keywords are synonyms.
The statement must begin with one of these keywords.

The `WORK`, `TRAN`, and `TRANSACTION` keywords are synonyms.
The statement must contain one of these keywords.

=== Transaction Settings

Currently, the only available transaction setting is "isolation level read committed".
This setting is enabled by default.
The `ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED` keywords are therefore optional and may be omitted.

== Return Value

The statement returns an object containing the following property.

txid::
The transaction ID.

If you are using the Query Workbench or the Query REST API, you must set the {txid}[txid] query parameter to specify the transaction ID for any subsequent statements that form part of the same transaction.

If you are using the cbq shell, you don't need to specify the transaction ID for any subsequent statements that form a part of the same transaction.
Once you have started a transaction, all statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.
footnote:[You must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above to use the automatic transaction ID functionality.]

== Examples

[[ex-1]]
.Begin a transaction with default parameters
====
.Request
[source,n1ql]
----
START TRANSACTION;
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "txid": "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51" // <.>
    }
]
----
<.> The transaction ID.
If you are using the Query Workbench or the Query REST API, you must use this ID to add further statements to the transaction.
====

[[ex-2]]
.Begin a transaction and set parameters -- cbq shell
====
.Request
[source,console]
----
cbq> \SET -txtimeout "2m"; -- <.>
cbq> \SET -scan_consistency "request_plus"; -- <.>
cbq> \SET -durability_level "majority"; -- <.>
cbq> START TRANSACTION;
----

<.> The transaction timeout.
<.> The transaction scan consistency.
No scan consistency is set for individual statements within the transaction; they inherit from the transaction scan consistency.
<.> Durability level of all the mutations within the transaction.
====

[[ex-3]]
.A statement participating in the transaction -- cbq shell
====
.Request
[source,console]
----
cbq> SELECT ...;
----

You do not need to specify the transaction ID within the same cbq shell session.
====

[[ex-4]]
.Begin a transaction and set parameters -- REST API
====
.CURL request
[source,console]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8093/query/service \
-u Administrator:password \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "statement": "START TRANSACTION",
  "pretty": true,
  "txtimeout": "2m",
  "scan_consistency": "request_plus",
  "durability_level": "majority"
}'
----

This is equivalent to the request in <<ex-2>>.
====

[[ex-5]]
.A statement participating in the transaction -- REST API
====
.CURL request
[source,console]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8093/query/service \
-u Administrator:password \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "statement": "SELECT ...",
  "pretty": true,
  "txid": "d81d9b4a-b758-4f98-b007-87ba262d3a51" // <.>
}'
----

This is equivalent to the request in <<ex-3>>.

<.> The transaction ID generated when the transaction began.
