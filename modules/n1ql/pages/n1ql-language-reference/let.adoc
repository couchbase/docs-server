= LET clause
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Use `LET` to create variables for later use within a query.

== Purpose

In a query expression, it is sometimes useful to store the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.
You can do this with the `LET` keyword, which creates a new variable and initializes it with the result of the expression you supply.
You can use the `LET` clause within an array, in a for-loop, or independently.

For example, create a variable for the minimum latitude and set it to 71 (detailed in <<examples_section,Example 1>>):

----
SELECT airportname, geo.lat
FROM `travel-sample`
LET minimum_lat = 71
WHERE geo.lat > minimum_lat;
----

Without the `LET` clause, your complex queries would need to be divided into two separate queries:

* One query to get a particular value (or set of values), and
* One query to use the value (or values) from the first query.

If the `LET` variable is referenced in the `WHERE` clause, then it is evaluated before the `WHERE` clause; otherwise, it is evaluated after the `WHERE` clause.

The `LET` clause can't be chained and can't be referenced by another `LET` variable.

Each `LET` alias needs to be unique within its scope.

== Prerequisites

The `LET` clause can only be used in a `SELECT` statement, and in order for you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.

----
LET (alias = expr) [, (alias2 = expr2)]*
----

== Arguments

alias:: [Required] String or expression that represents the name of the variable.

expr:: [Required] String or expression that represents the value assigned to its [.var]`alias`.

== Examples

*Example 1: Use LET to set variables to a number, an operation on a field, and a subquery.*

Find all airports and cities between certain latitudes in a country with a landmark.

----
SELECT t1.airportname, t1.geo.lat, t1.geo.lon, t1.city, t1.type
FROM `travel-sample` t1
LET min_lat = 71, max_lat = ABS(t1.geo.lon)*4+1,
    place = (SELECT RAW t2.country
            FROM `travel-sample` t2
            WHERE t2.type = "landmark")
WHERE t1.type = "airport"
AND t1.geo.lat > min_lat
AND t1.geo.lat < max_lat
AND t1.country IN place;
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "airportname": "Wiley Post Will Rogers Mem",
    "city": "Barrow",
    "lat": 71.285446,
    "type": "airport"
  },
  {
    "airportname": "Dillant Hopkins Airport",
    "city": "Keene",
    "lat": 72.270833,
    "type": "airport"
  }
]
----

*Example 2: Use LET to set a variable in an array.*

Find all Sunday flights (`day = 0`) to the Charles De Gaulle airport (`CDG`) on Air India (`AI`) airlines.

NOTE: In this example, the `LET` variable sch is not used in the `WHERE` clause but used only in the projection.
Therefore, the Query Planner defers the evaluation to post-predicate evaluation, so there is no overhead for documents that are not qualified by the predicates.

----
SELECT t1.airline, t1.destinationairport, sch AS schedule
FROM `travel-sample` AS t1
LET sch = ARRAY v FOR v IN t1.schedule WHEN v.day = 0 END
WHERE type = "route"
AND t1.destinationairport = "CDG"
AND t1.airline = "AI";
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "airline": "AI",
    "destinationairport": "CDG",
    "schedule": [
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI988",
        "utc": "00:24:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI972",
        "utc": "17:32:00"
      }
    ]
  }
]
