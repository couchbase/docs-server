{description}

== Purpose

In a query expression, it is sometimes useful to store the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.
You can do this with the `LET` keyword, which creates a new variable and initializes it with the result of the expression you supply.
You can use the `LET` clause within an array, in a for-loop, or independently.

For example, create a variable for the minimum latitude and set it to 71, as detailed in <<ex1>>:

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT airportname, geo.lat
FROM `travel-sample`
LET minimum_lat = 71
WHERE geo.lat > minimum_lat;
----

Without the `LET` clause, your complex queries would need to be divided into two separate queries:

* One query to get a particular value (or set of values), and
* One query to use the value (or values) from the first query.

If the `LET` variable is referenced in the `WHERE` clause, then it is evaluated before the `WHERE` clause; otherwise, it is evaluated after the `WHERE` clause.

Couchbase Server 6.5 and later support chained `LET` clauses.
A variable that you create in one `LET` clause may be referenced in a later `LET` clause, as detailed in <<ex3>>.

Each `LET` alias needs to be unique within its scope.

== Prerequisites

The `LET` clause can only be used in a `SELECT` statement, and in order for you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.

[subs="normal"]
----
LET <<arguments,alias>> '=' <<arguments,expr>> [ ',' <<arguments,alias>> '=' <<arguments,expr>> ]*

[#arguments]
== Arguments

alias:: [Required] String or xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] that represents the name of the variable.

expr:: [Required] String or xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] that represents the value assigned to its [.var]`alias`.

.Use LET to set variables to a number, an operation on a field, and a subquery
====
Find all airports and cities between certain latitudes in a country with a landmark.

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT t1.airportname, t1.geo.lat, t1.geo.lon, t1.city, t1.type
FROM `travel-sample` t1
LET min_lat = 71, max_lat = ABS(t1.geo.lon)*4+1,
    place = (SELECT RAW t2.country
            FROM `travel-sample` t2
            WHERE t2.type = "landmark")
WHERE t1.type = "airport"
AND t1.geo.lat > min_lat
AND t1.geo.lat < max_lat
AND t1.country IN place;

.Use LET to set a variable in an array
====
Find all Sunday flights (`day = 0`) to the Charles De Gaulle airport (`CDG`) on Air India (`AI`) airlines.

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT t1.airline, t1.destinationairport, sch AS schedule
FROM `travel-sample` AS t1
LET sch = ARRAY v FOR v IN t1.schedule WHEN v.day = 0 END <1>
WHERE type = "route"
AND t1.destinationairport = "CDG"
AND t1.airline = "AI";
----

.Results
[source,JSON]
----
[
  {
    "airline": "AI",
    "destinationairport": "CDG",
    "schedule": [
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI988",
        "utc": "00:24:00"
      },
      {
        "day": 0,
        "flight": "AI972",
        "utc": "17:32:00"
      }
    ]
  }
]
----
====

<1> In this example, the variable `sch` is not used in the `WHERE` clause, but used only in the projection.
Therefore, the Query Planner defers the evaluation to post-predicate evaluation, so there is no overhead for documents that are not qualified by the predicates.

[#ex3]
.Use chained LET
====
Variant of <<ex1>>.

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT t1.airportname, t1.geo.lat, t1.geo.lon, t1.city, t1.type
FROM `travel-sample` t1
LET max_lat = ABS(t1.geo.lon)*4+1, <1>
    min_lat = max_lat - 90, <2>
    place = (SELECT RAW t2.country
            FROM `travel-sample` t2
            WHERE t2.type = "landmark")
WHERE t1.type = "airport"
AND t1.geo.lat > min_lat
AND t1.geo.lat < max_lat
AND t1.country IN place;

  }
]
----
====

<1> The variable `max_lat` is defined in the first clause of the `LET` statement.
<2> The variable `max_lat` is referenced by the `min_lat` variable in the second clause of the `LET` statement.
