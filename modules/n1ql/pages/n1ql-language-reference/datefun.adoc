{description}
These functions are very useful for manipulating dates in datasets with various date formats and timezones.

[#date-timezone]
== Timezones

Datetime values are always tied to a specific timezone, either explicitly in the date value, or implicitly in the application.
The date functions in {sqlpp} therefore support multiple different timezones.

=== UTC

UTC, The Coordinated Universal Time is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
It is defined as the time at 0Â° longitude and is consistent, as it does not take into account daylight savings time.
You can read further about UTC at https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html[^].

All {sqlpp} functions which accept a timezone as an argument also accept `UTC`.

=== IANA Timezones

Many applications operate across multiple different time zones and may not necessarily use `UTC`.
Therefore, it is important for the database to be able to handle and manipulate dates in these time zones in a consistent manner.
Many date functions take the time zone as an additional argument.

NOTE: Timezones are case sensitive, `Europe/London` is not the same as `europe/london`.

It is important to note that many time zones change their UTC offset based on daylight savings time, as a result the UTC offset of times may change based on the time of year.
{sqlpp} take this into account when converting dates.

Below are a few examples of commonly used timezones and their offsets:

.Common Timezones
|====
| Timezone | UTC Offset (without daylight savings time) | UTC Offset (during daylight savings time)

| America/New_York
| -05:00
| -04:00

| America/Tijuana
| -08:00
| -07:00

| Europe/Paris
| +01:00
| +02:00

| Europe/London
| +00:00
| +01:00

| Asia/Tel_Aviv
| +02:00
| +03:00

| Asia/Kolkata
| +05:30
| +05:30
|====

=== Local System Timezone

Many functions default to using the local timezone of the system, which will be one of the IANA timezones.

[#date-formats]
== Date Formats

{sqlpp} date functions accept dates in either Epoch/UNIX timestamp format or string date format.
{sqlpp} is then able to represent the passed date as a standardized date object internally.
In general, functions whose name contains the word `STR` are designed to use string formats while `MILLIS` functions are designed to use Epoch/UNIX timestamps.

[[unix-time]]
=== Epoch/UNIX Timestamps

Epoch/UNIX time is the number of seconds (or milliseconds) that have elapsed since `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (Thursday, 1 January 1970 at midnight), not including leap seconds.
This can be useful for numeric and timezone agnostic representations of dates.
While Epoch/UNIX time can be represented in either seconds or milliseconds, _all {sqlpp} date functions specifically treat Epoch/UNIX timestamps as milliseconds_.
For example, the date `2017-01-31T10:02:07Z` would equate to an Epoch/UNIX timestamp of `1485856927000`.

[[date-string]]
=== Date String Formats

In many cases, dates are not stored as Epoch/UNIX timestamp but instead as more human-readable formats, such as `2006-01-02T15:04:05.567+08:00`.
Therefore, {sqlpp} also provides convenience methods to allow you to manipulate and convert dates in string format.

{sqlpp} accepts format strings following several conventions:

* *ISO-8601 example dates*, e.g. `1111-11-11`.
* *Date string component codes*, e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* *Go language native dates*, e.g. specifically `2006-01-02` for year, month, and day.
* *Percent-style date format specifiers*, e.g. `%Y-%m-%d`.

Only a single style can be used at a time in a specified format string.

ISO-8601 Dates::
+
--
https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[ISO-8601^] example dates are composed of the following date components.

[cols="2,1,2"]
|====
| Component | Code | Value

| Year
| YYYY
| Any four-digit integer from `1111` to `9999`

| Month (of the year)
| MM
| Any two digit integer from `01` to `12`

| Day (of the month)
| DD
| Any two digit integer from `01` to `31`

| Hour (of the day)
| hh
| Any two-digit integer from `00` to `23`

| Minute (of the hour)
| mm
| Any two-digit integer from `00` to `59`

| Second (of the minute)
| ss
| Any two-digit integer from `00` to `59`

| Millisecond (of the second) -- output only
| s
| Any three-digit integer from `000` to `999`

| Time Zone (as UTC offset)
| TZD
| UTC offset in the format &plusmn;hh:mm

3+a|NOTE: A UTC offset of 0 (+00:00) can just be specified as `Z`.
|====

To specify a date format, you must put together example component values, as specified above, to create one of the following date formats.
ISO-8601 date formats are very specific; they must contain the correct components in the correct order, with punctuation exactly as shown.

[cols="1,2a"]
|====
| Format | Example

| YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD
| `1111-12-31T23:00:59.999+00:00` or `1111-12-31T23:00:59.999Z`

| YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD
| `1111-12-31T23:00:59+00:00` or `1111-12-31T23:00:59Z`

| YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.s
| `1111-12-31T23:00:59.999`

| YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
| `1111-12-31T23:00:59`

| YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.sTZD
| `1111-12-31 23:00:59.999+00:00` or `1111-12-31 23:00:59.999Z`

| YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ssTZD
| `1111-12-31 23:00:59+00:00` or `1111-12-31 23:00:59Z`

| YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.s
| `1111-12-31 23:00:59.999`

| YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
| `1111-12-31 23:00:59`

| YYYY-MM-DD
| `1111-12-31`

| hh:mm:ss.sTZD
| `23:00:59.999+00:00` or `23:00:59.999Z`

| hh:mm:ssTZD
| `23:00:59+00:00` or `23:00:59Z`

| hh:mm:ss.s
| `23:00:59.999`

| hh:mm:ss
| `23:00:59`
|====

The examples above use arbitrary values for the date components.
You can use any valid values in your date components, as long as the date format contains the correct combination of components and punctuation.

Note, however, that if you use Go reference date values as the date components, the example date is interpreted as a <<date-string,Go reference date>>, rather than an ISO-8601 example date.
This may cause some date formats to be interpreted differently to what you expect.
For example, the date format `2006-02-01` is interpreted as a Go reference date, where `02` is the day and `01` is the month.
--

Date String Codes::
+
--
For greater flexibility, you can specify a date format using date string codes.
These are based on the alphabetic format codes from the https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[ISO-8601^] standard, with some extensions.
The date string codes are given below.

[cols="1,2"]
|====
| Code | Component

| `CC`
| 2-digit century

| `YYYY`
| 4-digit century and year

| `YY`
| 2-digit year ^[<<default-values,note>>]^

| `MM`
| 2-digit month

| `DD`
| 2-digit day

| `hh`
| 2-digit hour, 00-23

| `HH`
| 2-digit hour, 00-23

| `mm`
| 2-digit minute, 00-59

| `ss`
| 2-digit second, 00-59

| `s`
| Fraction of a second (down to millisecond) -- output only

| `TZD`
| Time Zone (as UTC offset)
|====

To specify a date format, you can put the date string components together in any order, along with any other characters as required.

{other-characters}
For example, `YYYY MM DD` parses `2021-06-28`, `2021/06/28`, `2021.06.28`, etc.

Go Reference Dates::
+
--
You can specify a date format using https://golang.org/pkg/time/#pkg-constants[Go language date components^].

To specify a date format, you can put the reference date components together in any order, along with any other characters as required.

{other-characters}
For example, `2006 01 02` parses `2021-06-28`, `2021/06/28`, `2021.06.28`, etc.
--

Percent-Style Dates::
+
--
Date and time functions also accept `printf`-style format specifiers for date formats, based on the Unix https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html[date^] command.
Format specifiers begin with a percent character `%` and take the following form:

[source,ebnf]
----
format-specifier ::= '%' ( '%' | ( '-' | '_' | '0' | '^' )? width? element)
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/format-specifier.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

The optional hyphen (`-`), underscore (`&lowbar;`), or zero (`0`) characters specify the padding for number fields.

[horizontal]
hyphen `-`;; No padding for numeric date components.
underscore `_`;; Padding with spaces for numeric date components.
zero `0`;; Padding with zeros for numeric date components -- the default.

The optional circumflex (`^`) character specifies case insensitivity when parsing text date components, or a preference for upper case when outputting text date components.

The _width_ is accepted but ignored for parsing, and is used for output.
However, it should rarely be needed, as elements have common or expected default widths.

The _element_ is a single character which specifies a date component or an entire date format.
The elements are given in the table below.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|====
| Element | Meaning | Example

| `D`
| Short form date, YYYY-MM-DD
| `2021-06-28`

| `1624904579`

|====

To specify a date format, you can put the format specifiers together in any order, along with any other characters as required.
If you need to include a literal percent symbol in the date format, use the special format specifier `%%`.

{other-characters}
For example, `%Y %m %d` parses `2021-06-28`, `2021/06/28`, `2021.06.28`, and so on.

====

[NOTE#default-values]
.Default Values
====
If the date string does not explicitly declare the value of a component, then the following default values are assumed:

* The month and day default to 1.
* The century (when not specified by year) defaults to 19 if year is greater than or equal to 69, or 20 otherwise.
* All other numeric components default to 0.
* The time zone defaults to the local local system time zone.

In cases where the timezone is not specified, the local system time is assumed.

For example, `2016-02-07` is equivalent to `2016-02-07T00:00:00` and parsing just `16` as the year is equivalent to `2016-01-01T00:00:00` in the local system time zone.
====

[#manipulating-components]
== Manipulating Date Components

Dates are composed of multiple different components such as the day, year, month, etc.
It is important for applications to be able to extract and manipulate particular components of a date, so that these can be used in {sqlpp} queries.
Functions such as <<fn-date-add-str,DATE_ADD_STR()>> accept a `part` argument, which is the component to adjust.

The following are the supported date parts that can be passed to date manipulation functions.
These date parts are expressed as strings and are not case-sensitive, so `year` is regarded the same as `YeAr`.
For all examples, the date being used is `2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z`.

.Date and Time Components
[cols="3,5,1,1,1"]

| `iso_year`
| The ISO-8601 year.
Each ISO-8601 year begins with the Monday of the week containing the 4th of January, so in early January and late December the ISO year may differ from the Gregorian year.
Should be used in conjunction with `iso_week` to get consistent results.

| The number of the week of the year, based on the ISO definition.
ISO weeks start on Mondays and the first week of a year contains January 4 of that year.
In other words, the first Thursday of a year will always be in week 1 of that year.
This results in some different results between `week` and `iso_week`, based on the input date.

For example the `iso_week` of `2006-01-08T15:04:05.999Z` is 1, while the `week` is 2.

== Date Functions

Below is a list of all date functions that {sqlpp} provides.

IMPORTANT: Many date functions use the local system clock value and timezone of the query node to generate results.
Therefore, if all nodes running the query service do not have their time appropriately synchronized then you may experience inconsistent behavior.
It is recommended that all Couchbase Server nodes have their xref:install:synchronize-clocks-using-ntp.adoc[time synchronized via NTP].

NOTE: If any arguments to any of the following functions are `MISSING` then the result is also `MISSING` (i.e.
no result is returned).
Similarly, if any of the arguments are `NULL` then `NULL` is returned.

[#fn-date-clock-local]
== CLOCK_LOCAL([fmt])

=== Description

The current time (at function evaluation time) of the machine that the query service is running on, in the specified string format.

=== Arguments

fmt::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
+
*Optional argument*.
If no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

=== Return Value

A date string in the format specified representing the local system time.

=== Limitations

`CLOCK_LOCAL()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.

If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_LOCAL()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-local,NOW_LOCAL()>> instead.

=== Examples

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT CLOCK_LOCAL() as full_date,
       CLOCK_LOCAL('invalid date') as invalid_date,
       CLOCK_LOCAL('1111-11-11') as short_date;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----

  {
    "full_date": "2018-01-23T13:57:29.847-08:00",
    "invalid_date": "2018-01-23T13:57:29.847-08:00",
    "short_date": "2018-01-23"
  }
]
----
====

[#fn-date-clock-millis]
== CLOCK_MILLIS()

=== Description

The current time as an Epoch/UNIX timestamp.
Its fractional part represents nanoseconds, but the additional precision beyond milliseconds may not be consistent or guaranteed on all platforms.

=== Arguments

This function accepts no arguments.

=== Return Value

A single float value (with 3 decimal places) representing the system time as Epoch/UNIX time.

=== Limitations

`CLOCK_MILLIS()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.

If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_MILLIS()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-millis,NOW_MILLIS()>> instead.

=== Examples

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT CLOCK_MILLIS() AS CurrentTime;
----

[#fn-date-clock-str]
== CLOCK_STR([fmt])

=== Description

The current time (at function evaluation time) of the machine that the query service is running on, in the specified string format.

=== Arguments

fmt::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
.
+
*Optional argument*.
If no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

=== Return Value

A date string in the format specified representing the system time.

=== Limitations

`CLOCK_STR()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.

If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_STR()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-str,NOW_STR()>> instead.

=== Examples

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT CLOCK_STR() as full_date,
       CLOCK_STR('invalid date') as invalid_date,
       CLOCK_STR('1111-11-11') as short_date;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----

    "short_date": "2018-01-23"
  }
]
----
====

[#fn-date-clock-tz]
== CLOCK_TZ(tz [, fmt])

=== Description

The current time (at function evaluation time) in the timezone given by the timezone argument passed to the function.
This time is the local system time converted to the specified timezone.

=== Arguments

tz::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<date-timezone,timezone>> to convert the local time to.
+
If this argument is not a valid timezone then `null` is returned as the result.

fmt::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
+
*Optional argument*.
If no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

=== Return Value

An date string in the format specified representing the system time in the specified timezone.

=== Limitations

As this function converts the local time, it may not accurately represent the true time in that timezone.

`CLOCK_TZ()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.

If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_TZ()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-tz,NOW_TZ()>> instead.

=== Examples

[#fn-date-clock-utc]
== CLOCK_UTC([fmt])

=== Description

The current time in UTC.
This time is the local system time converted to UTC.
This function is provided for convenience and is the same as `CLOCK_TZ('UTC')`.

=== Arguments

fmt::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
+
*Optional argument*.
If no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

=== Return Value

An date string in the format specified representing the system time in UTC.

=== Limitations

As this function converts the local time, it may not accurately represent the true time in UTC.

`CLOCK_UTC()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.

If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_UTC()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-utc,NOW_UTC()>> instead.

=== Description

Performs date arithmetic on a particular component of an Epoch/UNIX timestamp value.
This calculation is specified by the arguments `n` and `part`.
+
For example, a value of 3 for `n` and a value of `day` for `part` would add 3 days to the date specified by `date1`.

=== Arguments

date1::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing an Epoch/UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.
+
If this argument is not an integer then `null` is returned.

n::
The value to increment the date component by.
This value must be an integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, and may be negative to perform date subtraction.
+
If a non-integer is passed to the function then `null` is returned.

part::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<manipulating-components,component>> of the date to increment.

=== Description

Generates an array of dates from the start date specified by `date1` and the end date specified by `date2`, as Epoch/UNIX timestamps.
The difference between each subsequent generated date can be adjusted.

=== Arguments

date1::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing a Epoch/UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.
This is the value that is subtracted from `date1`.
+
If this argument is not an integer, then `null` is returned.

date2::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing a Epoch/UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.
+
This is the value that is subtracted from `date1`.
+
If this argument is not an integer, then `null` is returned.

part::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<manipulating-components,component>> of the date to increment.
+
If an invalid part is passed to the function, then `null` is returned.

n::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing the value by which to increment the part component for each generated date.
+
*Optional argument*.
If not specified, this defaults to 1.
If a value which is not an integer is specified, then `null` is returned.

=== Return Value

An array of integers representing the generated dates, as Epoch/UNIX timestamps, between `date1` and `date2`.

=== Limitations

It is possible to generate very large arrays using this function.
In some cases the query engine may be unable to process all of these and cause excessive resource consumption.
It is therefore recommended that you first validate the inputs to this function to ensure that the generated result is a reasonable size.

If the start date is greater than the end date passed to the function then an error will not be thrown, but the result array will be empty.
An array of descending dates can be generated by setting the start date greater than the end date and specifying a negative value for `n`.

[#fn-date-range-str]
== DATE_RANGE_STR(start_date, end_date, date_interval [, quantity_int ])

=== Description

Generates an array of date strings between the start date and end date, calculated by the interval and quantity values.
The input dates can be in any of the <<date-string,supported date formats>>.

=== Arguments

start_date::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a date in a <<date-string,supported date format>>.
This is the date used as the start date of the array generation.
+
If this argument is not an integer, then `null` is returned.

end_date::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a date in a <<date-string,supported date format>>.
This is the date used as the end date of the array generation, and this value is exclusive, that is, the end date will not be included in the result.
+
If this argument is not an integer, then `null` is returned.

date_interval::
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<manipulating-components,component>> of the date to increment.
+
If an invalid part is passed to the function, then `null` is returned.

quantity_int::
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing the value by which to increment the interval component for each generated date.
+
*Optional argument*.
If not specified, this defaults to 1.
If a value which is not an integer is specified, then `null` is returned.

=== Return Value

An array of strings representing the generated dates, as date strings, between `start_date` and `end_date`.

=== Limitations

* It is possible to generate very large arrays using this function.
In some cases the query engine may be unable to process all of these and cause excessive resource consumption.
It is therefore recommended that you first validate the inputs of this function to ensure that the generated result is a reasonable size.

* If the `start_date` is greater than the `end_date`, then an error will not be thrown, but the result array will be empty.
An array of descending dates can be generated by setting the `start_date` greater than the `end_date` and specifying a negative value for `quantity_number`.

* From 4.6.2, both specified dates can be different acceptable date formats; but prior to 4.6.2, both specified dates must have the same string format, otherwise `null` will be returned.
To ensure that both dates have the same format, you should use <<fn-date-format-str,DATE_FORMAT_STR()>>.
