[#datefun]
= Date Functions

[abstract]
N1QL date functions return the system clock value or manipulate the datetime values, which are represented as a string or an integer.
These functions are very useful for manipulating dates in datasets with various date formats and timezones.

[#date-timezone]
== Timezones

*UTC*::
UTC, The Coordinated Universal Time is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
It is defined as the time at 0Â° longitude and is consistent, as it does not take into account daylight savings time.
You can read further about UTC at https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html[].
+
All N1QL functions which accept a timezone as an argument also accept `UTC`.

*IANA Timezones*::
Many applications operate across multiple different time zones and may not necessarily use `UTC`.
Therefore, it is important for the database to be able to handle and manipulate dates in these time zones in a consistent manner.
Many date functions take the time zone as an additional argument.
+
NOTE: Timezones are case sensitive, `Europe/London` is not the same as `europe/london`.
+
It is important to note that many time zones change their UTC offset based on daylight savings time, as a result the UTC offset of times may change based on the time of year.
N1QL take this into account when converting dates.
+
Below are a few examples of commonly used timezones and their offsets:
+
.Common Timezones
[#table_sfk_mqq_5y]
|===
| Timezone | UTC Offset (without daylight savings time) | UTC Offset (during daylight savings time)

| America/New_York
| -05:00
| -04:00

| America/Tijuana
| -08:00
| -07:00

| Europe/Paris
| +01:00
| +02:00

| Europe/London

| +01:00

| Asia/Tel_Aviv
| +02:00
| +03:00

| Asia/Kolkata
| +05:30
| +05:30
|===

*Local System Timezone*:: Many functions default to using the local timezone of the system, which will be one of the IANA timezones.

[#date-formats]
== Date Formats

N1QL date functions accept dates in either Epoch/UNIX timestamp format or string date format.
N1QL is then able to represent the passed date as a standardized date object internally.
In general, functions whose name contains the word `STR` are designed to use string formats while `MILLIS` functions are designed to use Epoch/UNIX timestamps.

[[unix-time]]*Epoch/UNIX Timestamps*::
Epoch/UNIX time is the number of seconds (or milliseconds) that have elapsed since `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z` (Thursday, 1 January 1970 at midnight), not including leap seconds.
This can be useful for numeric and timezone agnostic representations of dates.
While Epoch/UNIX time can be represented in either seconds or milliseconds, *all N1QL date functions specifically treat Epoch/UNIX timestamps as milliseconds*.
For example, the date `2017-01-31T10:02:07Z` would equate to an Epoch/UNIX timestamp of 1485856927000.

[[date-string]]*Date String Formats*::
In many cases, dates are not stored as Epoch/UNIX timestamp but instead as more human-readable formats, such as `2006-01-02T15:04:05.567+08:00`.
Therefore, N1QL also provides convenience methods to allow you to manipulate and convert dates in string format.
All date formats follow the https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[ISO-8601 standard].
+
The supported string formats are composed of the following components:

[NOTE]
====
Currently N1QL only accepts numeric format strings with valid values for each component.
For example, you should pass something like `"1111-11-11"` as the date format rather than `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, this has the same effect as passing in any other valid date in the same format (such as `"2017-01-31"`).

If the date string does not explicitly declare the value of a component, then a value of 0 is assumed.
For example `2016-02-07` is equivalent to `2016-02-07T00:00:00`.
This is with the exception of the time zone, which if unspecified in the date string will default to the local system time zone.

N1QL is very specific as to what it accepts as a valid date format, below are a few examples:

[#ul_orx_pyb_wy]
* `"01:01:01"` - Valid
* `"hh:mm:ss"` - Invalid
* `"01:01:01.111"` - Valid
* `"01:01.111"` - Invalid
* `"2017-01-31"` - Valid
* `"2017-01-86"` - Invalid

[#manipulating-components]
== Manipulating Date Components

Dates are composed of multiple different components such as the day, year, month etc.
It is important for applications to be able to manipulate particular components of a date.
Functions such as <<fn-date-add-str,DATE_ADD_STR()>> accept a `part` argument, which is the component to adjust.
Below is a list of accepted parts, these are expressed as strings and are not case-sensitive:

[#ul_egx_j5q_5y]
* `millennium`
* `century`
* `decade`
* `year`
* `quarter`
* `month`
* `week`
* `day`
* `hour`
* `minute`
* `second`
* `millisecond`

[#extracting-components]
== Extracting Date Components

It is important for applications to be able to extract the specific component of the timestamps, such as day, year, month, hours, minutes, or seconds, so that these can be used in N1QL queries.
The following are the supported date parts that can be passed to the date extraction functions.
These date parts are expressed as strings and are not case-sensitive, so `year` is regarded the same as `YeAr`.
For all examples, the date being used is `2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z`

.Timestamp Components

| iso_year
| The ISO-8601 week number of the year.
Each ISO-8601 year begins with the Monday of the week containing the 4th of January, so in early January and late December the ISO year may differ from the Gregorian year.
Should be used in conjunction with `iso_week` to get consistent results.

| quarter
| The number of the quarter (3 month period) of the year.
January-March (inclusive) is 1 while October-December (inclusive) is 4.

| 1

| month
| The number of the month of the year.
January is 1 and December is 12.

| 1

| week
| The number of the week of the year.
This is the ceiling value of the day of the year divided by 7.

| iso_week
| The number of the week of the year, based on the ISO definition.
ISO weeks start on Mondays and the first week of a year contains January 4 of that year.
In other words, the first Thursday of a year will always be in week 1 of that year.
This results in some different results between week and iso_week based on the input date.

For example the `iso_week` of `2006-01-08T15:04:05.999Z` is 1, while the `week` is 2.
Should be used in conjunction with `iso_year` to get consistent results.

[#section_trq_pwq_5y]
== Date Functions

Below is a list of all date functions that N1QL provides.

IMPORTANT: Many date functions use the local system clock value and timezone of the query node to generate results.
Therefore, if all nodes running the query service do not have their time appropriately synchronized then you may experience inconsistent behaviour.
It is recommended that all Couchbase Server nodes have their xref:install:synchronize-clocks-using-ntp.adoc[time synchronized via NTP].

NOTE: If any arguments to any of the following functions are `MISSING` then the result is also `MISSING` (i.e.
no result is returned).
Similarly, if any of the arguments are `NULL` then `NULL` is returned.

[#fn-date-clock-local]
== CLOCK_LOCAL([fmt])

*Description*:: The current time (at function evaluation time) of the machine that the query service is running on, in the specified string format.

*Arguments*::
*fmt*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
+
*Optional argument*, if no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

*Return Value*:: A date string in the format specified representing the local system time.

*Limitations*:: `CLOCK_LOCAL()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.
If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_LOCAL()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-local,NOW_LOCAL()>> instead.

*Examples*::

[source,json]
----
SELECT CLOCK_LOCAL() as full_date, CLOCK_LOCAL('invalid date') as invalid_date, 
    CLOCK_LOCAL('1111-11-11') as short_date;

{
    "results": [
        {
            "full_date": "2017-01-31T03:49:30.612-08:00",
            "invalid_date": "2017-01-31T03:49:30.612-08:00",
            "short_date": "2017-01-31"
        }
    ]
}
----

[#fn-date-clock-millis]
== CLOCK_MILLIS()

*Description*::
The current time as an Epoch/UNIX timestamp.
Its fractional part represents nanoseconds, but the additional precision beyond milliseconds may not be consistent or guaranteed on all platforms.

*Arguments*:: This function accepts no arguments.

*Return Value*:: A single float value (with 3 decimal places) representing the system time as Epoch/UNIX time.

*Limitations*:: `CLOCK_MILLIS()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.
If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_MILLIS()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-millis,NOW_MILLIS()>> instead.

*Examples*::

[#fn-date-clock-tz]
== CLOCK_TZ(tz [, fmt])

*Description*::
The current time (at function evaluation time) in the timezone given by the timezone argument passed to the function.
This time is the local system time converted to the specified timezone.

*Arguments*::
*tz*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<date-timezone,timezone>> to convert the local time to.
If this argument is not a valid timezone then `null` is returned as the result.

*fmt*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a <<date-string,supported date format>> to output the result as.
*Optional argument*, if no format or an incorrect format is specified, then this defaults to the combined full date and time.

*Return Value*:: An date string in the format specified representing the system time in the specified timezone.

*Limitations*:: As this function converts the local time, it may not accurately represent the true time in that timezone.
`CLOCK_TZ()` cannot be used as part of an index definition, this includes the indexed fields and the `WHERE` clause of the index.
If this function is called multiple times within the same query then the values returned may differ, particularly if the query takes a long time to run.
To avoid inconsistencies between multiple calls to `CLOCK_TZ()` within a single query, use <<fn-date-now-tz,NOW_TZ()>> instead.

[#fn-date-diff-str]
== DATE_DIFF_STR(date1, date2, part)

*Description*::
Finds the elapsed time between two dates specified as formatted strings.
This elapsed time is measured from the date specified by `date2` to the date specified by `date1`.
If `date1` is greater than `date2` then the value returned will be positive, otherwise the value returned will be negative.

*Arguments*::
*date1*;;
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a date in a <<date-string,supported date format>>.
This is the value that `date2` is subtracted from.
If this argument is not a valid date string then `null` is returned.

*date2*;;
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing a date in a <<date-string,supported date format>>.
This is the value that is subtracted from `date1`.
If this argument is not a valid date string then `null` is returned.

*part*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<manipulating-components,component>> of the date to increment.
If an invalid part is passed to the function then `null` is returned.

*Return Value*:: An integer representing the elapsed time (based on the specified `part`) between both dates.

*Examples*::

[#fn-date-range-millis]
== DATE_RANGE_MILLIS(date1, date2, part [,n])

*Description*::
Generates an array of dates from the start date specified by `date1` and the end date specified by `date2`, as Epoch/UNIX timestamps.
The difference between each subsequent generated date can be adjusted.

*Arguments*::
*date1*;;
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing a Epoch/UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.
This is the date used as the start date of the array generation.
If this argument is not an integer then `null` is returned.

*date2*;;
An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing an Epoch/UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.
This is the date used as the end date of the array generation.
This value is exclusive, i.e the end date will not be included in the result.
If this argument is not an integer then `null` is returned.

*part*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, representing the <<manipulating-components,component>> of the date to increment.
If an invalid part is passed to the function then `null` is returned.

*n*;; An integer, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to an integer, representing the value by which to increment the part component for each generated date.
*Optional argument*, if not specified, this defaults to 1.
If a value which is not an integer is specified, then `null` is returned.

*Return Value*:: An array of integers representing the generated dates, as Epoch/UNIX timestamps, between `date1` and `date2`.

*Limitations*::
It is possible to generate very large arrays using this function.
In some cases the query engine may be unable to process all of these and cause excessive resource consumption.
It is therefore recommended that you first validate the inputs to this function to ensure that the generated result is a reasonable size.
If the start date is greater than the end date passed to the function then an error will not be thrown, but the result array will be empty.
An array of descending dates can be generated by setting the start date greater than the end date and specifying a negative value for `n`.
