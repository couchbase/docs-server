= DELETE
:page-topic-type: concept

DELETE immediately removes the specified document from your keyspace.
DELETE uses the following syntax:

----
DELETE FROM keyspace-ref
[USE KEYS clause]
[WHERE clause]
[LIMIT clause]
[RETURNING clause]
----

*keyspace-ref*

Specifies the data source from which to delete the document.
You can add an optional namespace name to the keyspace name in this way:

----
[ (namespace-name :)] keyspace-name
----

Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

*USE KEYS clause*_(optional)_

Specifies the keys of the data items to be deleted.
Keys can be any expression.

----
USE [PRIMARY] KEYS expression
----

*WHERE clause*_(optional)_

Specifies the condition that needs to be met for data to be deleted.

----
WHERE condition
----

*LIMIT clause*_(optional)_

Specifies the greatest number of objects that can be deleted.
This clause must have a non-negative integer as its upper bound.

----
LIMIT expression
----

*RETURNING clause*_(optional)_

Returns the data you deleted as specified in the [.var]`result_expression`.

----
RETURNING (result-expression [, result-expression]* | [RAW | ELEMENT ] expression)
----

*RBAC Privileges*

User executing the DELETE statement must have the _Query Delete_ privilege granted on the target keyspace/bucket.
If the statement has any RETURNING clauses that need data read, then the _Query Select_ privilege is also required on the keyspaces referred in the respective clauses.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

In summary, see the below table.
