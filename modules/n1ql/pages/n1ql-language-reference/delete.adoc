== Prerequisites

=== RBAC Privileges

To execute the DELETE statement, you must have the _Query Delete_ privilege granted on the target keyspace.
If the statement has any RETURNING clauses that need data read, then the _Query Select_ privilege is also required on the keyspaces referred in the respective clauses.
For more details about user roles, see
{authorization-overview}[Authorization].

In summary, see the below table.
