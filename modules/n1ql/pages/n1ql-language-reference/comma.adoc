== Purpose

A comma-separated join is used within the {from}[FROM] clause.
Like the {join}[JOIN] clause, it creates an input object by combining two or more source objects.
A comma-separated join can combine arbitrary fields from the source documents, and you can chain several comma-separated joins together.

(((join predicate,comma-separated join)))
The comma-separated join, by itself, does not specify a join predicate.
This means that, in its basic form, the comma-separated join would produce all the possible combinations of the combined source objects -- this is known as the _Cartesian product_.

In practice, it is common to use the query's {where}[WHERE] clause to specify a condition for the comma-separated join.
Refer to the examples below for further details.

== Prerequisites

For you to select data from keyspace or expression, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on that keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see {authorization}[Authorization].

(((join type,comma-separated join)))
The comma-separated join is a type of inner join.
For each joined object produced, both the left-hand side and right-hand side source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

(((right-hand side,comma-separated join)))
The _right-hand side_ of a comma-separated join may be a keyspace reference, a subquery, or a generic expression term.

[[rhs-keyspace]]
=== Right-Hand Side Keyspace

[#rhs-keyspace-ref]
==== Keyspace Reference

Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the comma-separated join.
For details, see {from-keyspace}[Keyspace Reference].

[#rhs-keyspace-alias]
==== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the keyspace reference.
For details, see {as-alias}[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the keyspace reference is optional.
If you assign an alias to the keyspace reference, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[#rhs-keyspace-hints]
==== USE Clause

Enables you to specify that the join should use particular keys, a particular index, or a particular join method.
For details, see {use-clause}[ANSI JOIN Hints].

TIP: You can also supply a join hint within a specially-formatted {hints}[hint comment].
Note that you cannot specify a join hint for the same keyspace using both the `USE` clause and a hint comment.
If you do this, the `USE` clause and the hint comment are both marked as erroneous and ignored by the optimizer.

[[rhs-subquery]]
=== Right-Hand Side Subquery

[horizontal.compact]
subquery-expr:: <<ansi-subquery-expr>> icon:caret-down[]
alias:: <<ansi-subquery-alias>> icon:caret-down[]

[#ansi-subquery-expr]
==== Subquery Expression

Use parentheses to specify a subquery for the right-hand side of the comma-separated join.
For details, see {from-subquery}[Subquery Expression].

NOTE: A subquery on the right-hand side of the comma-separated join cannot be *correlated*, i.e. it cannot refer to a keyspace in the outer query block.
This will lead to an error.

[#ansi-subquery-alias]
==== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the subquery.
For details, see {as-alias}[AS Clause].

You must assign an alias to a subquery on the right-hand side of the join.
However, when you assign an alias to the subquery, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[rhs-generic]]
=== Right-Hand Side Generic Expression

expr:: <<ansi-generic-expr>> icon:caret-down[]
alias:: <<ansi-generic-alias>> icon:caret-down[]

[#ansi-generic-expr]
==== Expression Term

A N1QL {expr}[expression] generating JSON documents or objects for the right-hand side of the comma-separated join.

NOTE: An expression on the right-hand side of the comma-separated join may be *correlated*, i.e. it may refer to a keyspace on the left-hand side of the join.
In this case, only a <<ansi-join-hints,nested-loop join>> may be used.

[#ansi-generic-alias]
==== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the generic expression.
For details, see {as-alias}[AS Clause].

You must assign an alias to the generic expression if it is not an identifier; otherwise, assigning an alias is optional.
However, when you assign an alias to the generic expression, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

== Limitations

* You can chain comma-separated joins with ANSI `JOIN` clauses, ANSI `NEST` clauses, and `UNNEST` clauses.
However, you cannot chain comma-separated joins with lookup `JOIN` and `NEST` clauses, or index `JOIN` and `NEST` clauses.

* The right-hand side of a comma-separated join can only be a keyspace identifier, a subquery, or a generic expression.
This means that comma-separated joins must come _after_ any `JOIN`, `NEST`, or `UNNEST` clauses.
