Simple case expressions allow for conditional matching within an expression.
The evaluation process is as follows:

* The first WHEN expression is evaluated.
If it is equal to the search expression, the result of this expression is the THEN expression.
* If it is not equal, subsequent WHEN clauses are evaluated in the same manner.
* If none of the WHEN expressions are equal to the search expression, then the result of the CASE expression is the ELSE expression.
* If no ELSE expression was provided, the result is NULL.

Searched case expressions allow for conditional logic within an expression.
The evaluation process is as follows:

* The first WHEN condition is evaluated.
* If TRUE, the result of this expression is the THEN expression.
* If not TRUE, subsequent WHEN clauses are evaluated in the same manner.
* If none of the WHEN clauses evaluate to TRUE, then the result of the expression is the ELSE expression.
* If no ELSE expression was provided, the result is NULL.

=== Example

The following example uses a CASE clause to handle documents that do not have a ship date.
This scans all orders.
If an order has a shipped-on date, it is provided in the result set.
If an order does not have a shipped-on date, default text appears.

====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT
   CASE WHEN `shipped-on`
   IS NOT NULL THEN `shipped-on`
   ELSE "not-shipped-yet"
   END
   AS shipped
   FROM orders
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
{ "shipped": "2013/01/02" },
{ "shipped": "2013/01/12" },
{ "shipped": "not-shipped-yet" },
