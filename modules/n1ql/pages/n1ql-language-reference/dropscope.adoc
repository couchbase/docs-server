image::n1ql-language-reference/drop-scope.png["drop-scope ::= 'DROP' 'SCOPE' ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope"]

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket which contains the scope you want to delete.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket which contains the scope you want to delete.

scope::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the scope that you want to delete.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name or the scope name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

== Usage

When you delete a scope, any collections within that scope are deleted also.

== Example

====
This statement deletes a scope called `events` in the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP SCOPE `travel-sample`.events
