[abstract]
The `NEST` clause creates an input object by producing a single result of nesting keyspaces.

== Purpose

Create an input object by producing a single result of nesting keyspaces via <<section_tc1_nnx_1db,ANSI NEST>>, <<nest,Lookup NEST>>, or <<section_rgr_rnx_1db,Index NEST>>.

== Prerequisites

For you to select data from keyspace or expression, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on that keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== ANSI NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 5.5)_

NOTE: ANSI NEST (and <<section_ek1_jnx_1db,ANSI JOIN>>) clauses are much faster and have much more flexible functionality than their earlier INDEX and LOOKUP equivalents, so users are strongly recommended to use ANSI NEST (and ANSI JOIN) exclusively, where possible.

ANSI NEST supports more nest types than Couchbase Server version 4.0's NEST could.
ANSI NEST can nest arbitrary fields of the documents and can be chained together.

The key difference between the currently supported nests and ANSI NEST support is the replacement of the current `ON KEYS` or `ON KEY … FOR` clauses with a simple `ON` clause.
The `ON KEYS` or `ON KEY … FOR` clauses dictate that those nests can only be done on a document key (primary key for a document).
The `ON` clause can contain any expression, and thus it opens up many more nest possibilities that Couchbase did not previously support.

=== Syntax

image::n1ql-language-reference/FROM_ansi-nest_RR-clause_5.5.png[,80%]

`lhs-expr` `[``nest-type``] NEST` `rhs-expr` `ON` `nest-clause`

=== Arguments

lhs-expr:: [Required] Keyspace reference or expression representing the left-hand side of the nest clause.

nest-type::
[Optional.
Default is `INNER`] String representing the type of nest.
`INNER`::
[Optional.
Default is `INNER`]
+
For each nested object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT [OUTER]`::
[Optional.
Query Service interprets `LEFT` as `LEFT OUTER`]
+
For each nested object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`NEST` *rhs-expr*:: [Required] Keyspace reference or expression representing the right-hand side of the nest clause.

`ON` *nest-clause*:: [Required] Boolean expression representing the nest condition between the left-hand side expression and the right-hand side expression, which can be fields, constant expressions or any complex N1QL expression.

=== Limitations

The following nest types are currently not supported:

* Full OUTER NEST
* Cross NEST
* No mixing of new ANSI NEST syntax with NEST syntax in the same FROM clause.
* The right-hand-side of any nest must be a keyspace.
Expressions, subqueries, or other join combinations cannot be on the right-hand-side of a nest.
* A nest can only be executed when appropriate index exists on the inner side of the ANSI NEST (similar to current NEST support).
* Adaptive indexes are not considered when selecting indexes on inner side of the nest

[#nest]
== Lookup NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

Nesting is conceptually the inverse of unnesting.
Nesting performs a join across two keyspaces.
But instead of producing a cross-product of the left and right inputs, a single result is produced for each left input, while the corresponding right inputs are collected into an array and nested as a single array-valued field in the result object.

=== Syntax

image::n1ql-language-reference/FROM_lookup-nest_4.0_RR.png[,80%]

----
[ join-type ] NEST from-path [ [ AS ] alias ] on-keys-clause
----

=== Arguments

join-type:: [Optional; default is `INNER`]
`INNER`;; For each result object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

`LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER`;;
A left-outer unnest is performed, and at least one result object is produced for each left source object.
+
For each joined object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-`MISSING` and non-`NULL`.

from-path::
[Required] Keyspace reference for right-hand side of lookup nest.
For details, see <<sec_from-keyspace,Keyspaces>>.

alias (optionally, `AS` alias)::
[Required] To assign a name for the right-hand side keyspace.
For details, see <<section_ax5_2nx_1db,AS Keyword>>.

on-keys-clause::
[Required] String or expression representing the primary keys of the documents for the second keyspace.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression produces one or more document keys for the right-hand side document.
+
The `ON KEYS` expression can produce an array of document keys.

=== Return Values
If the right-hand source object is NULL, MISSING, empty, or a non-array value, then the result object's right-side value is MISSING (omitted).

Nests can be chained with other NEST, JOIN, and UNNEST clauses.
By default, an INNER NEST is performed.
This means that for each result object produced, both the left and right source objects must be non-missing and non-null.
The right-hand side result of NEST is always an array or MISSING.
If there is no matching right source object, then the right source object is as follows:

|===
| If the `ON KEYS` expression evaluates to | Then the right-side value is

| `MISSING`
| `MISSING`

| `NULL`
| `MISSING`

| an array
| an empty array

| a non-array value
| an empty array
|===

[#section_rgr_rnx_1db]
== Index NEST Clause

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

When Lookup NESTs cannot efficiently nest left-hand side documents with right-to-left nests and your situation cannot be flipped because your predicate needs to be on the left-hand side (such as the above <<Lookup-NEST-Example-1>> where airline documents have no reference to route documents), then Index NESTs can be used efficiently.
Index NESTs allow you to flip the direction of your nest clause.

[#Index-NEST-Example-1]
.List four
====
[source,N1Ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_ijoin ON `travel-sample`(airlineid) WHERE type="route";
----

[source,N1Ql]
----
SELECT *
FROM `travel-sample` rte
  INNER NEST `travel-sample` aline
  ON KEY rte.airlineid
  FOR rte
WHERE rte.type = "route"
LIMIT 4;
----

If you generalize the same query, it looks like the following:

[source,N1QL]
----
CREATE INDEX on-key-for-index-name rhs-expression (lhs-expression-key);
----

[source,N1Ql]
----
SELECT projection-list
FROM lhs-expression
  NEST rhs-expression
  ON KEY rhs-expression.lhs-expression-key FOR lhs-expression
[ WHERE predicates ] ;
----
====

There are three important changes in the index scan syntax example above:

* `CREATE INDEX` on the `ON KEY` expression `route.airlineid` to access `route` documents using `airlineid` (which are produced on the LHS).
* The `ON KEY route.airlineid FOR airline` enables N1QL to use the index `route.airlineid`.
* Create any optional index, such as `route.airline` that can be used on `airline` (LHS).

NOTE: For index nests, the syntax uses `ON KEY` (singular) instead of `ON KEYS` (plural).
This is because Index NESTs' `ON KEY` expression must produce a scalar value; whereas Lookup NESTs' `ON KEYS` expression can produce either a scalar or an array value.

`LEFT` or `LEFT INNER`;; For each nested object produced, both the left-hand and right-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

`LEFT OUTER`;; For each nested object produced, only the left-hand source objects must be non-MISSING and non-NULL.

from-path::
Keyspace reference for right-hand side of an index nest.
For details, see <<sec_from-keyspace,Keyspaces>>.

`AS` alias::
[Optional] To assign another name.
For details, see <<section_ax5_2nx_1db,AS Keyword>>.

`ON KEY` rhs-expression.lhs-expression-key::
rhs-expression;; Keyspace reference for the right-hand side of the index nest.

lhs-expression-key;; String or expression representing the attribute in `rhs-expression` referencing the document key for `lhs-expression`.

`FOR` lhs-expression:: Keyspace reference for the left-hand side of the index nest.

[cols="1h,3"]

| Left-Hand Side (lhs)
| Any field or expression that produces a value that will be matched on the right-hand side.

| Right-Hand Side (rhs)
| Anything that can have a proper index on the join expression.

| Left-Hand Side (lhs)
| Must produce a Document Key for the right-hand side.

| Right-Hand Side (rhs)
| Must have a Document Key.
