= Array Indexing

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.5)_

Array Indexing adds the capability to create global indexes on array elements and optimizes the execution of queries involving array elements.

This is a huge leap from the previous versions where secondary indexes could only be created and subsequently queried on whole arrays.
You can now create an index of array elements ranging from plain scalar values to complex arrays or JSON objects nested deeper in the array.

== N1QL Syntax

----
CREATE INDEX [ index_name ]
ON named_keyspace_ref ( index_key1, index_key2 , index_key3, ... )
 [ WHERE filter_expr ]
 [ USING GSI ]
 [ WITH { "nodes": [ "node_name" ],
          "defer_build": true | false
        }
 ];
----

[.var]`index_name`:: Specify a unique name to identify the index.

[.var]`named_keyspace_ref`::
+
----
named_keyspace_ref ::= [ namespace_name : ] keyspace_name
----
+
Specify the name of the keyspace or bucket to create an index on
[.var]`index_key`;;
+
----
index_key ::= expr | array_expr
----
+
Refers to the an attribute name or a scalar function or an ARRAY expression on the attribute.
This constitutes an index-key for the index.
[.var]`expr`:::
A xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#n1ql-lang-ref[N1QL expression] over any fields in the document.
This cannot use constant expressions, aggregate functions, or sub-queries.

[.var]`array_expr`:::
+
----
array_expr ::= full_array_expr | simple_array_expr
full_array_expr ::=
    (ALL | DISTINCT) ARRAY var_expr
        FOR var1 ( IN | WITHIN ) expr1
        [ , var2 ( IN | WITHIN ) expr2 ]
        [ ( WHEN condition ) ] END
simple_array_expr ::=
    (ALL | DISTINCT) expr
----
+
The [.cmd]`ARRAY` operator lets you map and filter the elements or attributes of a collection, object, or objects.
It evaluates to an array of the operand expression that satisfies the WHEN clause, if specified.
+
`+var_expr ::= function(var1, var2, ...)+`
[#ul_pw5_xgl_rz]
* The expression is a function of the variables [.var]`var1`, [.var]`var2`, etc.
used in the FOR clause, and the expressions [.var]`expr1`, [.var]`expr2`, etc.
evaluate to an array of objects, elements of which are represented by the variables [.var]`var1`, [.var]`var2`, etc.
respectively.
* The [.var]`var_expr` itself can be an [.var]`array_expr`, allowing nested array expression.
This enables creating array indexes on nested array fields.
See examples below.
+
[.var]`simple_array_expr`
+
When using [.var]`simple_array_expr`, only an array field name or an expression [.var]`expr` that can evaluate to an array can be specified.
In this case, all elements of the array are indexed.
+
NOTE: Currently, array indexing is limited to using only one index key with [.var]`array_expr`.
Furthermore, the [.var]`array_expr` must be the first index-key for the index to be leverages for a SELECT statement with an UNNEST clause on the array.
To create an array index involving multiple array elements or multiple arrays:
[#ul_cpy_q3l_rz]
* The [.var]`var_expr` can be constructed as a compound object constituted with different elements of the same array or multiple arrays.
* Subsequent SELECT or DML must use similar compound objects in the WHERE clause to use the array index.
See examples below.

+
NOTE: Couchbase 4.6.2 release introduces the following enhancements to array indexing:
[#ul_wb3_y3l_rz]
* Allow arbitrary variable names in array index selection.
That is, a SELECT query or DML that needs to use the array index can use different variable names in the query from those used in the array index definition.
In earlier releases, the variable names must exactly match.
See https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.5/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.html[4.5 documentation] for details.
* Support [.var]`simple_array_expr`, which provides simpler syntax for array indexing when all array elements are indexed as is, without requiring to use the ARRAY operator in the index definition.

+
NOTE: The variables used in query predicates (WHERE clauses) of subsequent SELECT/UPDATE/UPSERT/DELETE statements must be the same as those used in the above [.var]`array_expr`.
See <<query-predicate-format,Format of Query Predicate in SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE>> for details.

[.var]`filter_expr`:: Specifies WHERE clause predicates to qualify the subset of documents to include in the index.
+
[#query-predicate-format]
*Format of Query Predicate in SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE*
+
The query predicate, which must appear in the WHERE clause of a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement, must have the exact matching format as the variable in the array index key, including the name of the variable [.var]`x`.
+
Consider the following expressions used in a CREATE INDEX statement:
+
----
(a) DISTINCT ARRAY f(x) FOR x IN expr1 END;

(b) DISTINCT ARRAY f(x) FOR x WITHIN expr1 END;
----
+
And the expression used in the SELECT where clause as:
+
----
(c) ANY x IN expr2 SATISFIES g(x) END;

(d) ANY x WITHIN expr2 SATISFIES g(x) END
----
+
The following dependencies must be satisfied in Couchbase Server 4.5 for N1QL to consider the array index:
[#ul_k1w_4y2_cv]
* The index keys used in CREATE INDEX must be used in the where clause.
* [.var]`expr2` in (c) and (d) must be equivalent to [.var]`expr1` in (a) and (b).
This is a formal notion of equivalence.
For example, if they are the same expressions, or equivalent arithmetic expressions such as (x+y) and (y+x).
* The variable [.var]`x` in (c) and (d) must be exactly the same variable name as [.var]`x` in (a) and (b).
* [.var]`g(x)` in (c) and (d) must be sargable for [.var]`f(x)` in (a) and (b).
In other words, if there were a scalar index with key [.var]`f(x)`, then that index would be applicable to the predicate [.var]`g(x)`.
For example, the index key `UPPER(x)` is sargable for the predicate `UPPER(x) LIKE "John%"`.
* IN vs.
WITHIN: Index key (a) can be used for query predicate (c).
Index key (b) can be used for both query predicates (c) and (d).

+
NOTE: Index key (b) is strictly more expensive than index key (a), for both index maintenance and query processing.
Index key (b) and query predicate (d) are very powerful.
They can efficiently index and query recursive trees of arbitrary depth.

USING GSI:: USING clause specifies the index type to use.

WITH options:: Use the WITH clause to specify additional options and is fully supported with nodes and [.var]`defer_build` expressions.
+
See the xref:n1ql-language-reference/createindex.adoc#concept_npk_mth_rq[CREATE INDEX] statement for more details on the syntax.

== Simplified Array Syntax

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 5.0)_

Using Couchbase Server 5.0, you can now use a more simplified syntax to create an array index, for example:

----
CREATE INDEX idx
ON `travel-sample` (DISTINCT `schedule`)
WHERE type = "airline";
----

In the above example, you can directly use `schedule` instead of the `array_expr` described above.

== Examples

The following samples use the https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.6/sdk/sample-application.html[travel-sample] keyspace that is shipped with the product.

*Example 1*: Indexing all DISTINCT elements in an array

C1: Create an index on all schedules:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_sched
ON `travel-sample` ( DISTINCT ARRAY v.flight FOR v IN schedule END );
----

Q1: The following query finds the list of scheduled 'UA' flights:

----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.flight LIKE 'UA%' END;
----

*Example 2*: Partial index (with WHERE clause) of individual attributes from selected elements (using WHEN clause) of an array:

C2: Create an index on flight IDs scheduled in the first 4 days of the week:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_flight_day
ON `travel-sample` ( ALL ARRAY v.flight FOR v IN schedule WHEN v.day < 4 END )
WHERE type = "route" ;
----

Q2: The following query finds the list of scheduled 'UA' flights on day 1:

----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES (v.flight LIKE 'UA%') AND (v.day=1) END;
----

NOTE: The index C2 qualifies for the query Q2 because:

[#ul_x12_tkl_rz]
* Q2 predicate `type = "route"` matches that of the partial index WHERE clause.
* The ANY operator uses the index key `v.flight`  on which the index C2 is defined.
* The ANY-SATISFIES condition `v.day=1`  in Q2 is sargable to that in the index definition WHEN clause `v.day<4`.

*Example 3*: Compound array index with individual elements of an array and other non-array fields

C3: Create an index on scheduled flight IDs and number of stops:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_flight_stops
ON `travel-sample`
    ( stops, DISTINCT ARRAY v.flight FOR v IN schedule END )
WHERE type = "route" ;
----

Q3: The following query finds the list of scheduled 'UA' flights that have one or more stops:

----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND stops >=0
AND ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.flight LIKE 'UA%' END;
----

*Example 4*: Indexing the individual elements of nest arrays

Use the DISTINCT ARRAY clause in a nested fashion to index specific attributes of a document when the array contains other arrays or documents that contain arrays.
For example,

----
cbq> UPDATE `travel-sample`
     SET schedule[0] = {"day" : 7, "special_flights" :
                    [ {"flight" : "AI444", "utc" : "4:44:44"},
                      {"flight" : "AI333", "utc" : "3:33:33"}
                    ] }
     WHERE type = "route"
     AND destinationairport = "CDG" AND sourceairport = "TLV";
----

C4: The following creates a partial index on a nested array [.var]`special_flights`:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_nested ON `travel-sample`
    (DISTINCT ARRAY
        (DISTINCT ARRAY y.flight
        FOR y IN x.special_flights END)
    FOR x IN schedule END)
WHERE type = "route";
----

NOTE: In this case, the inner ARRAY construct (in *bold*) is used as the [.var]`var_expr` for the outer ARRAY construct in the N1QL Syntax above.

Q4: The following query uses nested ANY operator to use the index:

----
SELECT count(*) FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY x in schedule SATISFIES
    (ANY y in x.special_flights SATISFIES y.flight IS NOT NULL END)
END;
----

Q4A: The following query uses UNNEST operators to use the index:

----
SELECT count(*) FROM `travel-sample`
UNNEST schedule AS x
UNNEST x.special_flights AS y
WHERE type = "route"
AND y.flight IS NOT NULL;
----

*Example 5*: Array Index with multiple elements of an array

C5: Create an index on [.var]`flight` and [.var]`day` fields in [.var]`schedule`:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_flight_day ON `travel-sample`
    ( DISTINCT ARRAY [v.flight, v.day] FOR v IN schedule END)
WHERE type = "route" ;
----

Q5: The following query finds the list of scheduled 'US681' flights on day 2:

----
SELECT meta().id FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY v in schedule SATISFIES [v.flight, v.day] = ["US681", 2] END;
----

*Example 6*: Indexing all elements in an array using simplified syntax

C6: Create an index on all schedules using simplified array index syntax:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_sched_simple
ON `travel-sample` (ALL schedule)
WHERE type = "route";
----

Q6: The following query finds details of all route documents matching a specific schedule.
Note that elements of schedule array are objects, and hence the right side value of the predicate condition should be similarly structured object.

----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY v IN schedule
SATISFIES v = {"day":2, "flight": "US681", "utc": "19:20:00"} END;
----

Q6A: This is a variant of Q6 using the UNNEST in the SELECT statement.
The following query finds details of all route documents matching a specific schedule.

----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` t
UNNEST schedule sch
WHERE t.type = "route"
AND sch = {"day":2, "flight": "US681", "utc": "19:20:00"};
----

== Covering Array Index

Covering indexes is an efficient method of using an Index for a particular query, whereby the index itself can completely cover the query in terms of providing all data required for the query.
Basically, it avoids the fetch phase of the query processing and related overhead in fetching the required documents from data-service nodes.
For more details, see xref:developer-guide:covering-indexes.adoc#concept_yv4_c2z_wt[Covering Indexes].

Array indexing requires special attention to create covered array indexes.
In general, the array field itself should be included as one of the index keys in the CREATE INDEX definition.
For example, the index C1 does not cover the query Q1 because the Q1 projection list includes * which needs to fetch the document from the Data Service.
The following Q7 is covered by index C7:

C7:  Creating a Covered Array Index.

----
CREATE INDEX idx_sched_covered ON `travel-sample`
   ( DISTINCT ARRAY v.flight FOR v IN schedule END, schedule)
WHERE type = "route";
----

Q7:  Covered Array Index using the ANY clause.

[#section_xjg_gyq_rz]
--
----
EXPLAIN SELECT meta().id FROM `travel-sample`
USE INDEX (idx_sched_covered)
WHERE type = "route"
AND ANY v IN schedule SATISFIES v.flight LIKE 'UA%' END;

Result:
    {
      "plan": {
        "#operator": "Sequence",
        "~children": [
          {

                    IN (`travel-sample`.`schedule`) END)))",
                 "cover ((`travel-sample`.`schedule`))",
                 "cover ((meta(`travel-sample`).`id`))"
              ],
              "filter_covers": {
                "cover ((`travel-sample`.`type`))": "route",
                "cover (any `v` IN (`travel-sample`.`schedule`)
                SATISFIES ((\"UA" <= (`v`.`flight`))
                AND ((`v`.`flight`) < \"UB\")) END)":
                   true,
                     "cover (ANY `v` IN (`travel-sample`.`schedule`)
                     SATISFIES ((`v`.`flights`) LIKE \"UA%\" END)": true
              },
              "index": "idx_sched_covered",
       ...
----

NOTE: The query Q7 needs index C7 to cover it because the query predicate refers to the array `schedule` in the ANY operator.

NOTE: The index keys of an index must be used in the WHERE clause of a DML to use the index for that query.
In the SELECT or DML WHERE clause, Covered Array Indexes can be used by the following operators:

[#ul_kbj_sgr_rz]
* ANY:  As shown in query Q7.
* ANY AND EVERY:  As shown in query Q7A (a variant of Example Q7).

Q7A:  Covered Array Index using the ANY AND EVERY clause.

              "index": "idx_sched_covered",
       ...
----
--

NOTE: The Q7 Examples have the following limitation: the collection operator EVERY cannot use array indexes or covered array indexes because the EVERY operator needs to apply the SATISFIES predicate to all elements in the array, including the case where an array has zero elements.
As items cannot be indexed, it is not possible to index MISSING items, so the EVERY operator is evaluated in the N1QL engine and cannot leverage the array index scan.
For example, the following query Q7C uses the non-array index `def_type` ignoring the xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#concept_npj_srf_2s[USE INDEX hint] to use the array indexes (note that query C7 defines a DISTINCT array index while C7C defines an ALL array index, and both are ignored).

== Implicit Covered Array Index

N1QL supports simplified Implicit Covered Array Index syntax in certain cases where the mandatory array index-key requirement is relaxed to create a covering array-index.
This special optimization applies to those queries and DML which have WHERE clause predicates that can be exactly and completely pushed to the indexer during the array index scan.
For example:

[#ul_fls_24y_rz]
* ANY operator with an =, <, >, and LIKE predicate in the SATISFIES clause.
Not that the GSI indexes are tree structures that support exact match and range matches.
And the ANY predicate returns `true` as long as it finds at least one matching item in the index.
Hence, an item found in the index can cover the query.
Furthermore, this is covered by both ALL and DISTINCT array indexes.

          },
          ...
----

* UNNEST operator with =, <, >, or LIKE predicate in the WHERE clause.
This applies to only ALL array indexes because, for such index, all array elements are indexed in the array index, and the UNNEST operation needs all the elements to reconstruct the array.
Note that the array cannot be reconstructed if on DISTINCT elements of the array are indexed.
+
For example, the following query Q8A can be covered with the ALL index [.var]`idx_sched_covered_simple_all` in C8A, but Q8B is not covered when using the DISTINCT [.var]`index idx_sched_covered_simple` defined in C8.
