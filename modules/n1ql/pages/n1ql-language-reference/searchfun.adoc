Search functions enable you to use full text search (xref:fts:full-text-intro.adoc[FTS]) queries directly within a N1QL query.

[float]
=== Prerequisites

To use any of the search functions, the Search service must be available on the cluster.
It is also recommended, but not required, that you should create suitable full text indexes for the searches that you need to perform.
For more information, refer to xref:fts:fts-performing-searches.adoc#preparing-for-full-text-searches[Preparing for Full Text Searches].

[NOTE]
--
The examples in this page all assume that demonstration full text indexes have been created, as described in xref:fts:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes].
--

[float]
=== Authorization

You do not need credentials for the FTS service to be able to use the search functions in a query.
The role *Data Admin* must be assigned to those who intend to create indexes; and the role *Data Reader* to those who intend to perform searches.
For information on creating users and assigning roles, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

[float]
=== When to Use Search Functions

The search functions are useful when you need to combine a full text search with the power of a N1QL query; for example, combining joins and natural-language search in the same query.

If you only need to use the capabilities of a full text search without any N1QL features, consider making use of the Search service directly, through the user interface, the REST API, or an SDK.

[[search,SEARCH()]]
== SEARCH(`identifier`, `query`[, `options`])

=== Description

This function enables you to use a full text search to filter a result set, or as a join predicate.
It is only allowed in the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE] clause or the xref:n1ql-language-reference/join.adoc[ON] clause.

If a query contains a SEARCH function, the Query engine analyzes the entire query, including the search specification, to select the best index to use with this search, taking any index hints into account.
The Query engine then passes the search specification over to the Search engine to perform the search.

[TIP]
--
If no suitable full text index can be selected, or no full text index exists, the Query engine falls back on a Primary index or qualified GSI index to produce document keys, and then fetches the documents.
The Search service then creates a temporary index in memory to perform the search.
This process may be slower than using a suitable full text index.
--

=== Arguments

identifier::
[Required] An expression in the form `__keyspaceAlias__[.__path__]`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which to search, followed by the path to a field in which to search, using dot notation.
+
[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, and the identifier contains a path, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.
However, if the path is omitted, the keyspace or keyspace alias is mandatory.

* When the identifier contains a path, it is used as the default field in the _query_ argument, as long as the _query_ argument is a query string.
If the path is omitted, the default field is set to `{underscore}all`.
If the _query_ argument is a query object, the path is ignored.

* The path must use Search syntax rather than N1QL syntax; in other words, you cannot specify array locations such as `[*]` or `[3]` in the path.

* If the keyspace, keyspace alias, or path contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
--
+
The _identifier_ argument cannot be replaced by a N1QL query parameter.

query::
[Required] The full text search query.
This may be one of the following:
+
[cols="1a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| Type
| Description

| string
| A query string.
For more details, refer to xref:fts:fts-query-types.adoc#query-string-query-syntax[Query String Query].

| object
| The query object within a full text search request.
For more details, refer to xref:fts:fts-query-types.adoc[Query Types].

| object
| A complete full text search request, including sort and pagination options, and so on.
For more details, refer to xref:fts:fts-sorting.adoc[Sorting Query Results].
|===
+
The _query_ argument may be replaced by a N1QL query parameter, as long as the query parameter resolves to a string or an object.

options::
[Optional] A JSON object containing options for the search.
The object may contain the following fields:
+
[cols="1a,1a,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Type
| Description

| `index`
[Optional]
| string, object
| The `index` field may be a string, containing the name of a full text index in the keyspace.
(This may be a full text index alias, but only if the full text index is in the same keyspace.)
This provides an index hint to the Query engine.
If the full text index does not exist, an error occurs.

[TIP]
--
You can also provide an index hint to the Query engine with the xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-index-clause[USE INDEX clause].
This takes precedence over a hint provided by the `index` field.
--

'''

The `index` field may also be an object, containing an example of a full text index mapping.
This is treated as an input to the index mapping.
It overrides the default mapping and is used during index selection and filtering.

The object must either have a default mapping with no type mapping, or a single type mapping with the default mapping disabled.
For more information, refer to xref:fts:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

| `out`
[Optional]
| string
| A name given to this full text search operation in this keyspace.
You can use this name to refer to this operation using the <<search_meta>> and <<search_score>> functions.
If this field is omitted, the name of this full text search operation defaults to `"out"`.

| (other)
[Optional]
| (any)
| Other fields are ignored by the Query engine and are passed on to the Search engine as options.
The values of these options may be replaced with N1QL query parameters, such as `"analyzer": $analyzer`.
|===

+
The _options_ argument cannot be replaced by a N1QL query parameter, but it may contain N1QL query parameters.

=== Return Value

A boolean, representing whether the search query is found within the input path.

This returns `true` if the search query is found within the input path, or `false` otherwise.

=== Limitations

The Query service can select a full text index for efficient search in the following cases:

* If the SEARCH() function is used in a WHERE clause or in an ANSI JOIN.
The SEARCH() function must be on the leftmost (first) JOIN.
It may be on the outer side of a nested-loop JOIN, or either side of a hash JOIN.
RIGHT OUTER JOINs are rewritten as LEFT OUTER JOINs.

* If the SEARCH() function is evaluated on the `true` condition in positive cases: for example, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_)`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) = true`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) IN [true, true, true]`, or a condition including one of these with `AND` or `OR`.

The Query service cannot select a full text index for efficient search in the following cases:

* If a USE KEYS hint is present; or if the SEARCH() function is used on the inner side of a nested-loop JOIN, a lookup JOIN or lookup NEST, an index JOIN or index NEST, an UNNEST clause, a subquery expression, a subquery result, or a correlated query.

* If the SEARCH() function is evaluated on the `false` condition, or in negative cases: for example, `NOT SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_)`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) = false`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) != false`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) IN [false, true, 1, "a"]`, or in a condition using the relation operators `<`, `{lt}=`, `>`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, or `NOT LIKE`.

In these cases, the Query service must fetch the documents, and the Search service creates a temporary index in memory to perform the search.
This may affect performance.

If the SEARCH() function is present for a keyspace, no GSI covering scan is possible on that keyspace.
If more than one FTS or GSI index are used in the plan, IntersectScan or Ordered IntersectScan is performed.
To avoid this, use a USE INDEX hint.

Order pushdown is possible only if query ORDER BY has only <<search_score>> on the leftmost keyspace.
Offset and Limit pushdown is possible if the query only has a SEARCH() predicate, using a single search index -- no IntersectScan or OrderIntersectScan.
Group aggregates and projection are not pushed.

[[search_meta,SEARCH_META()]]
== SEARCH_META([`identifier`])

=== Description

This function is intended to be used an a query which contains a <<search>> function.
It returns the metadata given by the Search engine for each document found by the <<search>> function.
If there is no <<search>> function in the query, or if a full text index was not used to evaluate the search, the function returns MISSING.

=== Arguments

identifier::
[Optional] An expression in the form `{startsb}__keyspaceAlias__.{endsb}__outname__`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which the full text search operation was performed, followed by the outname of the full text search operation, using dot notation.

[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.

* The identifier must contain the outname if there is more than one <<search>> function in the query.
If there is only one <<search>> function in the query, the identifier may be omitted altogether.

* The outname is specified by the `out` field within the <<search>> function's _options_ argument.
If an outname was not specified by the <<search>> function, the outname defaults to `"out"`.

* If the keyspace or keyspace alias contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
--

=== Return Value

A JSON object containing the metadata returned by the Search engine.
By default, the metadata includes the score and ID of the search result.
It may also include other metadata requested by advanced search options, such as the location of the search terms or an explanation of the search results.

identifier::
[Optional] An expression in the form `{startsb}__keyspaceAlias__.{endsb}__outname__`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which the full text search operation was performed, followed by the outname of the full text search operation, using dot notation.

[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.

* The identifier must contain the outname if there is more than one <<search>> function in the query.
If there is only one <<search>> function in the query, the identifier may be omitted altogether.

* The outname is specified by the `out` field within the <<search>> function's _options_ argument.
If an outname was not specified by the <<search>> function, the outname defaults to `"out"`.

* If the keyspace or keyspace alias contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
