= Nested Operators and Expressions

In N1QL, nested operators and paths indicate expressions to access nested sub-documents within a JSON document or expression and follow the syntax:

A nested expression may contain field selection expressions, element selection expressions, and array slicing expressions.

----
field-expr | element-expr | slice-expr
----

These special operators are needed to access the data because Couchbase documents can have nested elements and embedded arrays.
The `.` operator is used to refer to children (one level down), and the `[ ]` is used to refer to an element in an array.
You can use a combination of these operators to access nested data at any depth in a document.

== Field Selection

The `.` operator is used to refer to children, that is, one level down in a nested expression.

Nested expressions support using the dot (.) operator to access fields nested inside of other objects.
The form .[expression] is used to access an object field named by evaluating the expression contained in the brackets.

_field-expression_

----
expression . ( identifier  | escaped identifier [ i ])
----

By default, field names are case sensitive.
To access a field case-insensitively, include the trailing `i`.

For example, if you have the following data:

[source,json]
----
{
  "address": {
    "city": "Mountain View"
  },
  "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

The following expressions all evaluate to `"Mountain View"`.

`address.city`, `pass:c[address.`CITY`i]`, `address.["ci" || "ty"]`, and `address.["CI" || "TY"]i`

== Element Selection

Nested expressions also support using the bracket notation ([position]) to access elements inside an array.
The [ ] operator is used to refer to an element in an array.
Negative positions are counted backwards from the end of the array.

_element-expression_

----
expression [ expression ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/element-expr.png["Syntax diagram"]

[source,json]
----
{
    "address": {
    "city": "Mountain View"
    },
    "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

In our example, the expression `revisions[0]` evaluates to `2013`.
The expression `revision[-1]` evaluates to `2010`.

== Array Slicing

You can get subsets or segments of an array; this is called array slicing.
Here is the syntax for array slicing:

----
source-array [ start_expr : [ end_expr ] ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/slice-expr.png["Syntax diagram"]

It returns a new a subset of the source array, containing the elements from position `start` to `end-1`.
The element at `start` is included, while the element at `end` is not.
The array index starts with 0.

If `end` is omitted, all elements from `start` to the end of the source array are included.

Negative positions are counted backwards from the end of the array.

The general nested expression has the following syntax.

----
expression [expression : [ expression ] ]
----

The following example shows a document and expressions with equivalent values.

----
{
  "address": {
       "city": "Mountain View"
  },
  "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

The expression `address.city` evaluates to the value `Mountain View`.

The expression `revisions[0]` evaluates to the value `2013`.

The expression `revisions[1:3]` evaluates to the array value `[2012, 2011]`.

The expression `revisions[1:]` evaluates to the array value `[2012, 2011, 2010]`.
