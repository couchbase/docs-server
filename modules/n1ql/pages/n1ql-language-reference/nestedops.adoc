{description}

A nested expression may contain field selection operators, element selection operators, and array slicing operators.

field-expr | element-expr | slice-expr

These special operators are needed to access the data because Couchbase documents can have nested objects and embedded arrays.
A field selection operator is used to refer to a field in an object, and an element selection operator is used to refer to an element in an array.
You can use a combination of these operators to access nested data at any depth in a document.

== Field Selection

Field selection operators use the dot notation `.` to refer to a child field, that is, a field one level down in a nested object.

The arguments `identifier` or `escaped-identifier` specify the name of the nested field.
The form `[ name-expr ]` is used to specify a nested field by evaluating the name expression contained in the brackets.

_field-expression_

----
expression . ( identifier  | escaped identifier [ i ])
----

By default, field names are case sensitive.
To access a field case-insensitively, include the trailing `i`.

For example, if you have the following data:

[source,json]
----
{
  "address": {
    "city": "Mountain View"
  },
  "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

The following expressions all evaluate to `"Mountain View"`.

`address.city`, `pass:c[address.`CITY`i]`, `address.["city"]`, and `address.["CITY"]i`

== Element Selection

Element selection operators use the bracket notation `[ ]` to access an element inside a nested array.
The `position` argument specifies an element in the array.
Negative positions are counted backwards from the end of the array.

_element-expression_

----
expression [ expression ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/element-expr.png["Syntax diagram"]

For example, given the following data:

[source,json]
----
{
    "address": {
    "city": "Mountain View"
    },
    "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

In our example, the expression `revisions[0]` evaluates to `2013`.
The expression `revision[-1]` evaluates to `2010`.

== Array Slicing

You can get subsets or segments of an array; this is called array slicing.
Here is the syntax for array slicing:

----
source-array [ start_expr : [ end_expr ] ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/slice-expr.png["Syntax diagram"]

It returns a new a subset of the source array, containing the elements from position `start-expr` to `end-expr` minus 1.
The element at `start-expr` is included, while the element at `end-expr` is not.
The array index starts with 0.

If `end-expr` is omitted, all elements from `start-expr` to the end of the source array are included.

Negative positions are counted backwards from the end of the array.

For example, given the following data:

[source,json]
----
{
  "address": {
       "city": "Mountain View"
  },
  "revisions": [2013, 2012, 2011, 2010]
}
----

The expression `revisions[1:3]` evaluates to the array value `[2012, 2011]`.

The expression `revisions[1:]` evaluates to the array value `[2012, 2011, 2010]`.
