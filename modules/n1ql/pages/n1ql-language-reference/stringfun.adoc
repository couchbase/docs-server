= String Functions
:page-topic-type: concept
:page-aliases: n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/string-functions

String functions perform operations on a string input value and returns a string or other value.

NOTE: If any arguments to any of the following functions are [.out]`MISSING` then the result is also [.out]`MISSING` (i.e.
no result is returned).
Similarly, if any of the arguments passed to the functions are `NULL` or are of the wrong type (e.g.
an integer instead of a string), then `NULL` is returned as the result.

[#fn-str-contains]
== CONTAINS(input_string, search_string)

*Description*::
Checks whether or not the specified search string is a substring of the input string (i.e.
exists within).
This returns `true` if the substring exists within the input string, otherwise `false` is returned.

*Arguments*::
*input_string*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

*search_string*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

*Return Value*:: A boolean, representing whether the search string exists within the input string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "SQL") as no_sql;

{
    "results": [
        {

        }
    ]
}
----

[#fn-str-initcap]
== INITCAP(input_string)

*Description*:: Converts the string so that the first letter of each word is uppercase and every other letter is lowercase (known as 'Title Case').

*Arguments*::
*input_string*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to title case.

*Return Value*:: A string, representing the input string converted to title case.

*Limitations*::
This function capitalizes the initial letter of every word in the sentence, this means that even short words such as "the" and "or" will be capitalized.
This does not strictly follow title case conventions used in the writing domain.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT INITCAP("N1QL is awesome") as n1ql;

{
    "results": [
        {

*input_string*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to find the length of.

*Return Value*:: An integer representing the length of the string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT LENGTH("") as empty_string,

`" "`).
+
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that represents the characters to trim from the input string.
Each character in this string will be trimmed from the input string, it is therefore not necessary to delimit the characters to trim.. For example specifying a character value of `"abc"` will trim the characters "a", "b" and "c" from the start of the string.

*Return Value*:: A string representing the input string with leading characters removed.

*Examples*::
+
----
SELECT LTRIM("...N1QL is awesome", ".") as dots,

[#fn-str-title]
== TITLE(input_string)

Alias for <<fn-str-initcap,INITCAP()>>.

[#fn-str-token]
== TOKENS(input_string, options)

*Description*::
This function tokenizes (i.e.
breaks up into meaningful segments) the given input string based on specified delimiters, and other options.
It recursively enumerates all tokens in a JSON value and returns an array of values (JSON atomic values) as the result.

*Arguments*::
*input_string*;;
A valid JSON object, this can be anything: constant literal, simple JSON value, JSON key name or the whole document itself.
+
The following table lists the rules for each JSON type:
+
|===
| JSON Type | Return Value

| MISSING
| []

| NULL
| [NULL]

| false
| [false]

| true
| [true]

| number
| [number]

| string
| SPLIT(string)

| array
| FLATTEN(TOKENS(element) for each element in array

(Concatenation of element tokens)

| object
| For each name-value pair, name+TOKENS(value)
|===

*options*;;
A JSON object indicating the options passed to the `TOKENS()` function.
Options can take the following options, and each invocation of `TOKENS()` can choose one or more of the options:
* *{"name": true}*: *Optional*.
Valid values are `true` or `false`.
By default, this is set to true and `TOKENS()` will include field names.
You can choose to not include field names by setting this option to `false`.
* *{"case":"lower"}*: *Optional*.
Valid values are [.in]`lower` or [.in]`upper`.
Default is neither — return the case in the data.
Use this option to specify the case sensitivity.
* *{"specials": true}*:**Optional**.
Use this option to preserve strings with specials characters, such as email addresses, URLs, and hyphenated phone numbers.
The default value is `false`.
+
NOTE: The `specials` options preserves special characters except at the end of a word.

*Return Value*:: An array of strings containing all of the tokens obtained from the input string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]

----
+
You can also use `{"case":"lower"}` or `{"case":"upper"}` to have case sensitive search.
Index creation and querying can use this and other parameters in combination.
These parameters should be passed within the query predicates as well.
The parameters and values have to match exactly for N1QL to pick up and use the index correctly.
The following example shows how you can create an index and use it your application.
