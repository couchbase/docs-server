= String Functions

String functions perform operations on a string input value and returns a string or other value.

NOTE: If any arguments to any of the following functions are [.out]`MISSING` then the result is also [.out]`MISSING` (i.e.
no result is returned).
Similarly, if any of the arguments passed to the functions are `NULL` or are of the wrong type (e.g.
an integer instead of a string), then `NULL` is returned as the result.

[#fn-str-contains]
== CONTAINS(in_str, search_str)

*Description*::
Checks whether or not the specified search string is a substring of the input string (i.e.
exists within).
This returns `true` if the substring exists within the input string, otherwise `false` is returned.

*Arguments*::
in_str;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

search_str;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

*Return Value*:: A boolean, representing whether the search string exists within the input string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
       CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "SQL") as no_sql;

{
    "results": [
        {
            "n1ql": true,
            "no_sql": false
        }
    ]
}
----

[#fn-str-initcap]
== INITCAP(in_str)

*Description*:: Converts the string so that the first letter of each word is uppercase and every other letter is lowercase (known as 'Title Case').

*Arguments*::
in_str;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to title case.

*Return Value*:: A string, representing the input string converted to title case.

*Limitations*::
This function capitalizes the initial letter of every word in the sentence, this means that even short words such as "the" and "or" will be capitalized.
This does not strictly follow title case conventions used in the writing domain.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT INITCAP("N1QL is awesome") as n1ql;

{
    "results": [
        {
            "n1ql": "N1ql Is Awesome"

----

[#fn-str-length]

*Arguments*::
*in_str*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to find the length of.

*Return Value*:: An integer representing the length of the string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT LENGTH("") as empty_string,
LENGTH("N1QL is awesome") as n1ql;

*in_str*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to lower case.

*Return Value*:: A string representing the input string converted to lower case.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT LOWER("N1QL is awesome") as n1ql;

{
    "results": [

[#fn-str-ltrim]
== LTRIM(in_str [, char])

*Description*::

*Arguments*::
*in_str*;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to remove the leading characters from.

*char*;;
[Optional; default is whitespace, i.e.
`" "`]
+
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that represents the characters to trim from the input string.
Each character in this string will be trimmed from the input string, it is therefore not necessary to delimit the characters to trim.
For example, specifying a character value of `"abc"` will trim the characters "a", "b" and "c" from the start of the string.

*Return Value*:: A string representing the input string with leading characters removed.

*Examples*::
+
----
SELECT LTRIM("...N1QL is awesome", ".") as dots,
       LTRIM("     N1QL is awesome", " ") as explicit_spaces,
       LTRIM("     N1QL is awesome") as implicit_spaces,

If the search string does not exist within the input string then the function returns -1.

*Arguments*::
in_str;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

search_str;; A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

*Return Value*:: An integer representing the first position of the search string.

*Examples*::
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "awesome") as awesome,
       POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
       POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "SQL") as sql

{
    "results": [
        {
            "awesome": 8,

*Limitations*::
It is possible to generate very large strings using this function.
In some cases the query engine may be unable to process all of these and cause excessive resource consumption.
It is therefore recommended that you first validate the inputs to this function to ensure that the generated result is a reasonable size.

*Examples*::

[source,json]
----
SELECT REPEAT("N1QL", 0) as empty_string,
       REPEAT("N1QL", 3) as n1ql_3;

[#fn-str-title]
== TITLE(in_str)

Alias for <<fn-str-initcap,INITCAP()>>.

[#fn-str-token]
== TOKENS(in_str, opt)

*Description*::
This function tokenizes (i.e.
breaks up into meaningful segments) the given input string based on specified delimiters, and other options.
It recursively enumerates all tokens in a JSON value and returns an array of values (JSON atomic values) as the result.

*Arguments*::
in_str;;
A valid JSON object, this can be anything: constant literal, simple JSON value, JSON key name or the whole document itself.
+
The following table lists the rules for each JSON type:
+
[#table_gy4_jhg_gy]
|===
| JSON Type | Return Value

| MISSING
| []

| NULL
| [NULL]

| false
| [false]

| true
| [true]

| number
| [number]

| string
| SPLIT(string)

| array
| FLATTEN(TOKENS(element) for each element in array

(Concatenation of element tokens)

| object
| For each name-value pair, name+TOKENS(value)
|===

opt;;
A JSON object indicating the options passed to the `TOKENS()` function.
Options can take the following options, and each invocation of `TOKENS()` can choose one or more of the options:
[#ul_hy4_jhg_gy]
* *{"name": true}*: *Optional*.
Valid values are `true` or `false`.
By default, this is set to true and `TOKENS()` will include field names.
You can choose to not include field names by setting this option to `false`.
* *{"case":"lower"}*: *Optional*.
Valid values are [.in]`lower` or [.in]`upper`.
Default is neither, as in it returns the case of the original data.
Use this option to specify the case sensitivity.
* *{"specials": true}*:**Optional**.
Use this option to preserve strings with specials characters, such as email addresses, URLs, and hyphenated phone numbers.
The default value is `false`.
+
NOTE: The `specials` options preserves special characters except at the end of a word.

*Return Value*::
An array of strings containing all of the tokens obtained from the input string.
+
NOTE: By default, for speed, the results are randomly ordered.
To make the difference more clear between the two example queries, the `ARRAY_SORT()` function is used.

*Examples*::
*Example 1a*: List the tokens of an array where `specials` is FALSE.
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS( ['jim@abc.com, kim@abc.com, http://abc.com/, 408-555-1212'],

Results:
[
  {
    "$1": [
      "1212",
      "408",
      "555",
      "abc",
      "com",
      "http",
      "jim",
      "kim"
    ]
  }
]
----

*Example 1b*: List the tokens of an array where `specials` is TRUE.
+

----
SELECT ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS(['jim@abc.com, kim@abc.com, http://abc.com/, 408-555-1212'],

Results:

      "jim@abc.com",
      "kim",
      "kim@abc.com"
    ]
  }
]
----
+
*Example 2*:  Convert all of the URL data into UPPER case and adds the full URL to the delimited words.
+
[source,json]
----
SELECT ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS(url) ) AS defaulttoken,
       ARRAY_SORT( TOKENS(url, {"specials":true, "case":"UPPER"}) ) AS specialtoken

      "WWW"
    ]
  }
]
----
+
You can also use `{"case":"lower"}` or `{"case":"upper"}` to have case sensitive search.
Index creation and querying can use this and other parameters in combination.
These parameters should be passed within the query predicates as well.
The parameters and values must match exactly for N1QL to pick up and use the index correctly.

*Example 3*: Create an index with `case` and use it your application.

Removes all leading and trailing characters from a string.
The function removes all consecutive characters from the beginning and end of the string that match the specified characters and stops when it encounters a character that does not match any of the specified characters.
This function is equivalent to calling `LTRIM()` and `RTRIM()` successively.
