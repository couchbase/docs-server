:description: String functions perform operations on a string input value and returns a string or other value.
:page-topic-type: concept

{description}

NOTE: If any arguments to any of the following functions are [.out]`MISSING` then the result is also [.out]`MISSING` (i.e.
no result is returned).
Similarly, if any of the arguments passed to the functions are `NULL` or are of the wrong type (e.g.
an integer instead of a string), then `NULL` is returned as the result.

[#fn-str-concat]
== CONCAT([.var]`string1`, [.var]`string2`, …)

=== Description
This function takes two or more strings and returns a new string after concatenating the input strings.
If there are fewer than two arguments, then it returns an error.

=== Arguments
string1, string2, \...:: [At least 2 are required] The strings, or valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expressions] which evaluate to strings, to be concatenated together.

=== Return Value
A new string, concatenated from the input strings.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT CONCAT("abc", "def", "ghi") AS concat;
----

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "concat": "abcdefghi"
  }
]
----
====

[#fn-str-concat2]
== CONCAT2([.var]`separator`, [.var]`arg1`, [.var]`arg2`, …)

=== Description
This function takes the input strings, or arrays of strings, and concatenates them with the specified separator between each input string.
If there are fewer than two arguments, then it returns an error.

=== Arguments
separator:: [Required] The string to separate the input strings.
If no separator is required, specify the empty string "".

arg1, arg2, \...:: [At least 1 is required] The strings, or arrays of strings, to be concatenated together.

=== Return Value
A new string, concatenated from the inputs, with the separator between each input.
Arrays of strings are flattened and concatenated in the same order.
If there is only one string argument, the separator is not used.

If any argument or array element is MISSING, returns MISSING.
If any argument or array element is non-string, returns NULL.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT CONCAT2('-','a','b',['c','d'],['xyz']) AS c1,
CONCAT2('-','a') AS c2,
CONCAT2('-',['b']) AS c3;
----

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "c1": "a-b-c-d-xyz",
    "c2": "a",
    "c3": "b"
  }
]
----

[#fn-str-contains]
== CONTAINS(in_str, search_str)

=== Description
Checks whether or not the specified search string is a substring of the input string (i.e.
exists within).
This returns `true` if the substring exists within the input string, otherwise `false` is returned.

=== Arguments
in_str:: A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

search_str:: A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

=== Return Value
A boolean, representing whether the search string exists within the input string.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
       CONTAINS("N1QL is awesome", "SQL") as no_sql;
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "results": [
        {

[#fn-str-initcap]
== INITCAP(in_str)

=== Description

=== Arguments
in_str:: A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to convert to title case.

=== Return Value
A string, representing the input string converted to title case.

=== Limitations
This function capitalizes the initial letter of every word in the sentence, this means that even short words such as "the" and "or" will be capitalized.
This does not strictly follow title case conventions used in the writing domain.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT INITCAP("N1QL is awesome") as n1ql;
----

[source,json]
----
{
    "results": [

[#fn-str-ltrim]
== LTRIM(in_str [, char])

char::
[Optional; default is whitespace, i.e.
`" "`]
+
A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that represents the characters to trim from the input string.
Each character in this string will be trimmed from the input string, it is therefore not necessary to delimit the characters to trim.
For example, specifying a character value of `"abc"` will trim the characters "a", "b" and "c" from the start of the string.

=== Return Value
A string representing the input string with leading characters removed.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT LTRIM("...N1QL is awesome", ".") as dots,

If the search string does not exist within the input string then the function returns -1.

=== Arguments
in_str:: A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search within.

search_str:: A string, or any valid xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] which evaluates to a string, that is the string to search for.

=== Return Value
An integer representing the first position of the search string.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "awesome") as awesome,
       POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "N1QL") as n1ql,
       POSITION("N1QL is awesome", "SQL") as sql

=== Return Value
A string representing the string generated by repeating the input string.

=== Limitations
It is possible to generate very large strings using this function.
In some cases the query engine may be unable to process all of these and cause excessive resource consumption.
It is therefore recommended that you first validate the inputs to this function to ensure that the generated result is a reasonable size.

=== Examples
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT REPEAT("N1QL", 0) as empty_string,
       REPEAT("N1QL", 3) as n1ql_3;
