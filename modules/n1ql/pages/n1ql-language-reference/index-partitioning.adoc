{description}
The system partitions the index across a number of index nodes using a hash partitioning strategy in a way that is transparent to queries.

[#idx-partition-intro]
--
Benefits of a partitioned index include:

* The ability to scale out horizontally as the index size increases.
* Transparency to queries, requiring no change to existing queries.
* Reduction of query latency for large aggregated queries since each partition can be scanned in parallel.
* Provides a low-latency range query while allowing indexes to be scaled out as needed.

For example, the following statement creates an index partitioned by the document ID:

Partitioned indexes are displayed in the Couchbase Web Console with a `partitioned` indicator:

For further details, refer to xref:manage:manage-indexes/manage-indexes.adoc[Manage Indexes].

== Syntax

To create a partitioned index, the overall syntax is the same as for a global secondary index.
The distinguishing feature is the use of the PARTITION BY HASH clause to specify the partitions.

Refer to the {createindex}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

[[partition-keys]]
== Partition Keys

Partition keys are made up of one or more terms, with each term being the document key, a document field, or an expression of document key or field.
The partition keys are hashed to generate a partition ID for each document.
The partition ID is then used to identify the partition in which the document's index keys would reside.

The partition keys should be immutable, that is, its values shouldn't change once the document is created.
For example, in the `landmark` keyspace, the field named `activity` almost never changes, and is therefore a good candidate for partition key.
If the partition keys have changed, then the corresponding document should be deleted and recreated with the new partition keys.

Each term in the partition keys can be any JSON data type: number, string, boolean, array, object, or NULL.
If a term in the partition keys is missing in the document, the term will have a N1QL MISSING value.
Partition keys do not support N1QL array expressions, e.g. `ARRAY` \... `FOR` \... `IN`.

The following table lists some examples of partition keys.

[cols="1,2"]

[#doc-keys-as-partition-key]
== Using Document Keys as Partition Key

The simplest way to create a partitioned index is to use the document key as the partition key.

.Create a partitioned index with partition key being the document key
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe1 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline (country, name, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH(META().id);

SELECT name, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline
WHERE country="United States"
ORDER BY name;
----
====

With [.cmd]`meta().id` as the partition key, the index keys are evenly distributed among all the partitions.
Every query will gather the qualifying index keys from all the partitions.

[#partition-keys-range-query]
== Choosing Partition Keys for Range Query

An application has the option to choose the partition key that can minimize latency on a range query for a partitioned index.
For example, let's say a query has an equality predicate based on the field `sourceairport` and `destinationairport`.
If the index is also partitioned by the index keys on `sourceairport` and `destinationairport`, then the query will only need to read a single partition for the given pair of `sourceairport` and `destinationairport`.
In this case, the application can maintain a low query latency while allowing the partitioned index to scale out as needed.

.Create a partitioned index with partition keys matching query equality predicate
====
Lookup all airlines with non-stop flights from SFO to JFK.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe2 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport="SFO" AND
destinationairport="JFK" AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

The partition keys do not have to be the leading index keys in order to select qualifying partitions.
As long as the leading index keys are provided along with the partition keys in the predicate, the query engine can still select the qualifying partitions for index scan.
The following example scans a single partition with a given pair of `sourceairport` and `destinationairport`.

.Create a partitioned index with partition keys being non-leading index keys
====
Lookup all non-stop flights from SFO to JFK for the given airlines.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe3 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE airline IN ["UA", "AA"] AND
sourceairport="SFO" AND
destinationairport="JFK" AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

If the partition keys are based on a N1QL expression, then the query predicate should use the same expression for selecting qualifying partitions.

.Create a partitioned index with partition keys as expressions
====
Case-insensitive lookup for all airlines with non-stop flights from SFO to JFK.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe4 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(LOWER(sourceairport), LOWER(destinationairport), stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (LOWER(sourceairport), LOWER(destinationairport))

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE LOWER(sourceairport)="sfo" AND
LOWER(destinationairport)="jfk" AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline
----
====

As with equality predicate in the previous examples, the query engine can select qualifying partitions using an IN clause with matching partitioned keys.
The following example scans at most three partitions with `sourceairport "SFO"`, `"SJC"`, or `"OAK"`.

.Create a partitioned index with partition keys matching query IN clause
====
Lookup for all airlines with non-stop flights from SFO, SJC, or OAK to JFK.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe5 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport IN ["SFO", "SJC", "OAK"] AND
destinationairport="JFK" AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

As shown in the previous examples, in order to allow the query engine to select qualifying partitions, the partition keys must be present as an equality predicate in the query.
The following query only has an equality predicate on `sourceairport` and hence will not be able to select the qualifying partitions without `destinationairport`.
Consequently, this query will gather qualifying index keys from all partitions.

.Create a partitioned index with non-matching query equality predicate
====
Lookup all airlines with non-stop flights from SFO.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe6 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport="SFO" AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

Similarly, the following query gathers qualifying index keys from all partitions as `destinationairport IS NOT MISSING` is not an equality predicate.

.Create a partitioned index with query non-equality predicate
====
Lookup all airlines with non-stop flights from SFO.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe7 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport="SFO" AND
destinationairport is not missing AND
stops == 0
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

For the query engine to select qualifying partitions, the partition keys must also be a part of the index keys.
The following index always gathers keys from all partitions as `destinationairport` is not an index key.

.Create a partitioned index with partition keys not being index keys
====
Lookup all airlines with flights from SFO to JFK.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe8 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, stops, airline, id)
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT airline, id
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport="SFO" AND
destinationairport="JFK"
ORDER BY airline;
----
====

When choosing partition keys other than the document key, the size of each partition can potentially be subjected to data skew of the chosen partition keys.
For example, for the index in the following example, the partitions containing the major airlines would have more entries since more index keys would end up hashing into the same partition.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, destinationairport, sourceairport)
 PARTITION BY HASH(airline);
----
====

During index rebalancing, the rebalancer takes into account the data skew among the partitions using runtime statistics.
It tries to even out resource utilization across the index service nodes by moving the partitions across the nodes when possible.

== Choosing Partition Keys for Aggregate Query

As with a range query, when an index is partitioned by document key, an aggregate query can gather the qualifying index keys from all the partitions before performing aggregation in the query engine.
Whenever aggregate pushdown optimization is allowed, the query engine will push down "partial aggregate" calculation to each partition.
The query engine then computes the final aggregate result from the partial aggregates across all the partitions.
For more details on aggregate query optimization, refer to {gbap}[Group By and Aggregate Performance].

.Create a partitioned index with partition key being document key
====
Find number of flights out of SFO for every destination across all airlines.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe9 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id, ARRAY_COUNT(schedule))
 PARTITION BY HASH (meta().id);

SELECT sourceairport, destinationairport, SUM(ARRAY_COUNT(schedule))
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport = "SFO"
GROUP BY sourceairport, destinationairport;
----
====

The choice of partition keys can also improve aggregate query performance when the query engine can push down the "full aggregate" calculation to the index node.
In this case, the query engine does not have to recompute the final aggregate result from the index nodes.
In addition, certain pushdown optimizations can only be enabled when a full aggregate result is expected from the index node.
To enable a full aggregate computation, the index must be created with the following requirements:

. The expressions in the GROUP BY clause must match the partition keys.
. The expressions in the GROUP BY clause must match the leading index keys.
. The partition keys must match the leading index keys.

.Create a partitioned index with the partition keys for full aggregate pushdown
====
Find number of flights out of SFO for every destination across all airlines.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe10 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(sourceairport, destinationairport, stops, airline, id, ARRAY_COUNT(schedule))
 PARTITION BY HASH (sourceairport, destinationairport);

SELECT sourceairport, destinationairport, SUM(ARRAY_COUNT(schedule))
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route
WHERE sourceairport = "SFO"
GROUP BY sourceairport, destinationairport;
----
====

== Number of Partitions

The number of index partitions is fixed when the index is created.
By default, each index will have 8 partitions.
The Administrator can override the number of partitions at index creation time.

.Create a partitioned index with 16 partitions
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe11 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, destinationairport)
 PARTITION BY HASH(airline) WITH {"num_partition": 16};
----
====

== Partition Placement

When a partitioned index is created, the partitions are created across available index nodes.
During placement of the new index, the index service assumes that each partition has an equal size and places the partitions according to the availability of resources on each node.
For example, if an index node has more available free memory than the other nodes, it will assign more partitions to this index node.
If the index has a replica, then the replica partition will not be placed onto the same node.

Alternatively, you can specify the node list to restrict the set of nodes available for placement by using a command similar to the following example.

.Create a partitioned index on specific nodes
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe12 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, destinationairport)
 PARTITION BY HASH(airline)
 WITH {"nodes": ["192.168.10.10:8091", "192.168.10.11:8091"]};
----
====

If you create a partitioned index on a specific set of nodes, and then decide that you want to specify a different set of nodes for partition placement, you need to remove the partitioned index and then recreate the partitioned index on a smaller or greater number of nodes.
However, refer also to the section on <<rebalancing,rebalancing a partitioned index>> below.

NOTE: To avoid any downtime, before removing the partitioned index, first create an equivalent index for your queries to continue using.

[[sizing-hints]]
=== Sizing Hints

You can optionally provide sizing hints too.
Given the sizing hints, the planner uses a formula to estimate the memory and CPU usage of the index.
Based on the estimated memory and CPU usage, the planner tries to place the partitions according to the free resources available to each index node.

.Sizing Hints
[cols="2,5,2"]
|===
| Optional Sizing Hint | Description | Example

| *secKeySize*
| The average length of the combined index keys.
| `20`

| *docKeySize*
| The average length of the document key `meta().id`.
| `20`

| *arrSize*
| The average length of the array field.
Non-array fields will be ignored.
| `10`

| *numDoc*
| The number of documents in the index.
| `7303`

| *residentRatio*
| The memory usage of the index, as a percentage of its estimated data size.
| `50`
|===

To provide sizing estimation, you can use a command similar to the following examples.

.Create a partitioned index with specific key sizes
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe13 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, destinationairport)
 PARTITION BY HASH (airline) WITH {"secKeySize": 20, "docKeySize": 20};
----
====

.Create a partitioned index with specific key and array sizes
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe14 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, schedule)
 PARTITION BY HASH (airline) WITH {"secKeySize": 20, "docKeySize": 20, "arrSize": 100};
----
====

== Partition Replica

A partitioned index can be created with multiple replicas to ensure indexes are online despite node failure.
if there are multiple server groups in a cluster, replica partitions will be spread out to each server group whenever possible.
If one of the server groups is offline, the remaining replica partitions will be available to serve all queries.
Every index replica is available to serve queries.
Therefore, index replicas can also be used to load rebalancing of query requests.

.Create an index with replica
====
[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_pe15 ON `travel-sample`.inventory.route
(airline, sourceairport, schedule)
 PARTITION BY HASH (airline) WITH {"num_replica": 2};
----
====

When an index node fails, any in-flight query requests (serviced by the failed node) will fail since the partial results are already being processed.
Any new query requests requiring the lost partition are then serviced by the partitions in the replica.

[[rebalancing]]
== Rebalancing

When new index nodes are added or removed from the cluster, the rebalance operation attempts to move the index partitions across available index nodes in order to balance resource consumptions.
At the time of rebalancing, the rebalance operation gathers statistics from each index.
These statistics are fed to an optimization algorithm to determine the possible placement of each partition in order to minimize the variation of resource consumption across index nodes.

The rebalancer will only attempt to balance resource consumption on a best try basis.
There are situations where the resource consumption cannot be fully balanced.
For example:

* The index service will not try to move the index if the cost to move an index across nodes is too high.
* A cluster has a mix of non-partitioned indexes and partitioned indexes.
* There is data skew in the partitions.

In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, the [def]_index redistribution_ setting enables you to specify how Couchbase Server redistributes indexes on rebalance.
For further details, refer to {rebalancing-the-index-service}[Rebalancing the Index Service].

== Repairing Failed Partitions

When an index node fails, the index partitions on that node will be lost.
The lost partitions can be recovered or repaired when:

. The failed node is delta-recovered.
. The failed node is rebalanced out of the cluster.
The lost partitions on that node can be repaired/rebuilt in other index nodes whenever possible.
The lost partitions cannot be repaired when the number of remaining nodes is less than or equal to the number of index replicas.

== Performance Considerations

=== Max Parallelism

Along with aggregate pushdown optimization, an application can further enhance the aggregate query performance by computing aggregation in parallel for each partition in the index service.
This can be controlled by specifying the parameter `max_parallelism` when issuing a query.
Starting with Couchbase Server 6.5, `max_parallelism` is set by default to match the number of partitions of the index.
Note that when `max_parallelism` is set to the default value, the index service uses more CPU and memory since the query traffic is increased.

****
[.edition]#{community}#

In Couchbase Server Community Edition, `max_parallelism` cannot be greater than 4.
****

=== OFFSET Pushdown

When there are more than one qualifying partitions involved in a range query, the query engine will not push down the OFFSET clause to the index service.
Without partition elimination, a partitioned index will have higher overhead for queries with a large OFFSET value.
Alternatively, applications can use `keyset` based pagination with partitioned index to achieve good pagination query performance, detailed in this blog https://blog.couchbase.com/offset-keyset-pagination-n1ql-query-couchbase/[Database Pagination: Using OFFSET and Keyset in N1QL^].

For aggregate queries, the query engine will pushdown the OFFSET clause whenever full aggregate result is expected and there is only 1 qualifying partition involved in the query.

=== LIMIT Pushdown

When there are more than one qualifying partitions involved in a range query, the query engine will pushdown the LIMIT clause by rewriting it to be the sum of values in the LIMIT clause and OFFSET clause.

For aggregate queries, the query engine will pushdown the LIMIT clause whenever a full aggregate result is expected.
When there are more than one qualifying partitions involved in an aggregate query, the query engine will pushdown the LIMIT clause by rewriting it to be the sum of values in the LIMIT clause and OFFSET clause.

=== DISTINCT Aggregate Pushdown

The query engine will not pushdown distinct aggregate calculation to the index node unless full aggregate result is expected.
