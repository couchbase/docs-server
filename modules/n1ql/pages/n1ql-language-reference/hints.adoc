= USE INDEX clause

[abstract]
The `USE INDEX` clause specifies the index to use in the query execution.

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 3.0)_

[#section_rhf_csp_2cb]
== Purpose

Use the `USE INDEX` clause to specify which index to use as part of the query execution.
The query engine attempts to use the specified index if the index is applicable for the query.

[#section_vnk_vtp_2cb]
== Arguments

index-ref:: [Required] String or expression representing the index or indexes to be used for the query.

`USING`:: [Optional; default is `USING GSI`] Specifies which index form to use.
`VIEW`;; The legacy index form, which lives on the data node.
`GSI`;; The newer and faster Global Secondary Index form, which lives on an index node and can possibly be separate from a data node.

[#section_vwt_d5p_2cb]
== Examples

*Example 1a: Use an existing index with GSI in a query.*

Create an index of airlines and destination airports, and then use it in a query for flights originating in San Francisco.

----
CREATE INDEX idx_destinations
ON `travel-sample` (airlineid, airline, destinationairport)
WHERE type="route";

SELECT airlineid, airline, sourceairport, destinationairport
FROM `travel-sample` USE INDEX (idx_destinations USING GSI)
WHERE sourceairport = "SFO";
----

*Example 1b: Use an existing index with VIEW in a query.*

The usage of `VIEW` is identical as that of `GSI`.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_destinations
ON `travel-sample` (airlineid, airline, destinationairport)
WHERE type="route";

SELECT airlineid, airline, sourceairport, destinationairport
FROM `travel-sample` USE INDEX (idx_destinations USING VIEW)
WHERE sourceairport = "SFO";
