= Statements

[abstract]
N1QL statements fall into three categories: data definition language (DDL) statements, data manipulation language (DML) statements, and query statements.

* Data Definition Language (DDL) statements let you create, modify, and delete indexes.
* Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements let you delete, insert, update, upsert, and merge data into JSON documents.

NOTE: DML statements are beta features and are not intended for use in production.
Production systems can use the existing data service API (key-value API) for data modification.

* Queries let you retrieve data.
