= Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions take multiple values from documents, perform calculations, and return a single value as the result.
The function names are case insensitive.

You can only use aggregate functions in `SELECT`, `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
When using an aggregate function in a query, the query operates as an aggregate query.

Aggregate functions take one argument, which is used to compute the aggregate function.
The `COUNT` function can also take a wildcard ({asterisk}) or a path with a wildcard (path.{asterisk}) as its argument.

If there is no input row for the group, `COUNT` functions return `0`.
All other aggregate functions return NULL.

----
SELECT AVG(stops) FROM `travel-sample`; <1>

SELECT AVG(DISTINCT stops) FROM `travel-sample`; <2>
----

----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "CountOfSDistinctStops": 2 <1>

[[max,MAX()]]
== MAX([.var]`expression`)

=== Examples
====

Max of a string field.

Find the hotel whose name is last alphabetically in `travel-sample`.

----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MaxName": "pentahotel Birmingham"
  }
]
----
====

That result might have been surprising since lowercase letters come after uppercase letters and are therefore "higher" than uppercase letters.
To avoid this uppercase/lowercase confusion, you should first make all values uppercase or lowercase, as in the following example.

====
Max of a string field, regardless of case.

Find the hotel whose name is last alphabetically in `travel-sample`.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT MAX(UPPER(name)) AS MaxName FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel";

[
  {
    "MinName": "'La Mirande Hotel"

----
====

That result might have been surprising since some symbols come before letters and are therefore "lower" than letters.
To avoid this symbol confusion, you can specify letters only, as in the following example.

====
Min of a string field, regardless of preceding non-letters.

Find the first hotel alphabetically in `travel-sample`.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT MIN(name) AS MinName FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel" AND SUBSTR(name,0)>="A";
