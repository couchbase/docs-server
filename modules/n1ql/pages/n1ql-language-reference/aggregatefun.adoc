{description}
The function names are case insensitive.

You can only use aggregate functions in `SELECT`, `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
When using an aggregate function in a query, the query operates as an aggregate query.

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, aggregate functions can also be used as {windowfun}[window functions] when they are used with a window specification, which is introduced by the `OVER` keyword.

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/window-intro.adoc[tag=syntax]

== Syntax

This section describes the generic syntax of aggregate functions.
Refer to sections below for details of individual aggregate functions.

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=aggregate-function]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/aggregate-function.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[horizontal.compact]
aggregate-quantifier:: <<aggregate-quantifier>> icon:caret-down[]
filter-clause:: <<filter-clause>> icon:caret-down[]
over-clause:: <<over-clause>> icon:caret-down[]

=== Arguments

Aggregate functions take a single {expression}[expression] as an argument, which is used to compute the aggregate function.
The `COUNT` function can instead take a wildcard ({asterisk}) or a {path}[path] with a wildcard (path.{asterisk}) as its argument.

[[aggregate-quantifier]]
=== Aggregate Quantifier

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=aggregate-quantifier]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/aggregate-quantifier.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

The *aggregate quantifier* determines whether the function aggregates all values in the group, or distinct values only.

`ALL`:: All objects are included in the computation.
`DISTINCT`:: Only distinct objects are included in the computation.

This quantifier can only be used with aggregate functions.

This quantifier is optional.
If omitted, the default value is `ALL`.

[[filter-clause]]
=== FILTER Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/n1ql.ebnf[tag=filter-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/filter-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

The FILTER clause enables you to specify which values are included in the aggregate.
This clause is available for aggregate functions, and aggregate functions used as window functions.
(It is not permitted for dedicated window functions.)

The FILTER clause is useful when a query contains several aggregate functions, each of which requires a different condition.

cond:: [Required] Conditional expression.
Values for which the condition resolves to TRUE are included in the aggregation.

The conditional expression is subject to the same rules as the conditional expression in the query WHERE clause, and the same rules as aggregation operands.
It may not contain a subquery, a window function, or an outer reference.

NOTE: If the query block contains an aggregate function which uses the FILTER clause, the aggregation is not pushed down to the indexer.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/groupby-aggregate-performance.adoc#filter-clause[Grouping and Aggregate Pushdown] for more details.

[[over-clause]]
=== OVER Clause

[.labels]
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

include::partial$n1ql-language-reference/over-clause.adoc[tag=body]

[[defaults]]
=== Default Values

If there is no input row for the group, `COUNT` functions return `0`.
All other aggregate functions return NULL.

[[array_agg,ARRAY_AGG()]]
== [[array_agg_distinct]]ARRAY_AGG( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value
With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns an array of the non-MISSING values in the group, including NULL values.

With the `DISTINCT` quantifier, returns an array of the distinct non-MISSING values in the group, including NULL values.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

====
List all values of the `Cleanliness` reviews given:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(reviews[0].ratings.Cleanliness) AS Reviews

----
[
  {
    "UniqueReviews": [
      -1,

      3,
      4,
      5
    ]
  }
]
----
====

[[avg,AVG()]]
== [[avg_distinct]]AVG( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

This function has an alias <<mean>>.

=== Return Value
With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns the arithmetic mean (average) of all the number values in the group.

With the `DISTINCT` quantifier, returns the arithmetic mean (average) of all the distinct number values in the group.

Returns NULL if there are no number values in the group.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

====
Find the average altitude of airports in the `airport` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$functions/avg.jsonc[]
----
====

====
Find the average number of stops per route vs. the average of distinct numbers of stops:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$functions/avg-all.n1ql[]
----

Results in 0.0002 since nearly all routes have 0 stops.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$functions/avg-distinct.n1ql[]
----

Results in 0.5 since all routes have only 1 or 0 stops.
====

[[count_all,COUNT(*)]]
== COUNT(*)

=== Return Value
Returns count of all the input rows for the group, regardless of value. footnote:count[{doc-count}]

=== Example
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

====
Find the number of documents in the `landmark` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) AS CountAll FROM landmark;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "CountAll": 4495
  }
]
----
====

[[count,COUNT()]]
== [[count_distinct]]COUNT( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value
With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns count of all the non-NULL and non-MISSING values in the group. footnote:count[]

With the `DISTINCT` quantifier, returns count of all the distinct non-NULL and non-MISSING values in the group.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

====

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNT(stops) AS CountOfStops FROM route;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "CountOfStops": 24024
  }
]
----
====

====
Find the number of unique values of airline route stops in the `route` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT stops) AS CountOfDistinctStops
FROM route;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "CountOfSDistinctStops": 2 <1>
  }
]
----

<1> Results in 2 because there are only 0 or 1 stops.
====

[[countn,COUNTN()]]
== COUNTN( {startsb} ALL {vbar} DISTINCT {endsb} `expression` )

=== Return Value
With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns a count of all the numeric values in the group. footnote:count[]

With the `DISTINCT` quantifier, returns a count of all the distinct numeric values in the group.

=== Examples
====
The count of numeric values in a mixed group.

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNTN(list.val) AS CountOfNumbers
FROM [
  {"val":1},
  {"val":1},
  {"val":2},
  {"val":"abc"}
] AS list;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "CountOfNumbers": 3
  }
]
----
====

====
The count of unique numeric values in a mixed group.

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNTN(DISTINCT list.val) AS CountOfNumbers
FROM [
  {"val":1},

----
====

[[max,MAX()]]
== MAX( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value

Returns the maximum non-NULL, non-MISSING value in the group in {sqlpp} collation order.

This function returns the same result with the `ALL` quantifier, the `DISTINCT` quantifier, or no quantifier.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

.Max of an integer field
====
Find the northernmost latitude of any hotel in the `hotel` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT MAX(geo.lat) AS MaxLatitude FROM hotel;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MaxLatitude": 60.15356
  }
]
----
====

.Max of a string field
====
Find the hotel whose name is last alphabetically in the `hotel` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT MAX(name) AS MaxName FROM hotel;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MaxName": "pentahotel Birmingham"
  }
]
----
====

That result might have been surprising since lowercase letters come after uppercase letters and are therefore "higher" than uppercase letters.
To avoid this uppercase/lowercase confusion, you should first make all values uppercase or lowercase, as in the following example.

.Max of a string field, regardless of case
====
Find the hotel whose name is last alphabetically in the `hotel` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT MAX(UPPER(name)) AS MaxName FROM hotel;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MaxName": "YOSEMITE LODGE AT THE FALLS"
  }
]

Alias for <<avg>>.

[[median,MEDIAN()]]
== [[median_distinct]]MEDIAN( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value

With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns the median of all the number values in the group.
If there is an even number of number values, returns the mean of the median two values.

With the `DISTINCT` quantifier, returns the median of all the distinct number values in the group.
If there is an even number of distinct number values, returns the mean of the median two values.

Returns NULL if there are no number values in the group.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

====
Find the median altitude of airports in the `airport` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT MEDIAN(geo.alt) AS MedianAltitude
FROM airport;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MedianAltitude": 361.5
  }
]
----
====

====
Find the median of distinct altitudes of airports in the `airport` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT MEDIAN(DISTINCT geo.alt) AS MedianAltitude FROM airport;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MedianDistinctAltitude": 758
  }
]
----
====

[[min,MIN()]]
== MIN( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value

Returns the minimum non-NULL, non-MISSING value in the group in {sqlpp} collation order.

This function returns the same result with the `ALL` quantifier, the `DISTINCT` quantifier, or no quantifier.

=== Examples
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=section]

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$functions/min-string.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$functions/min-string.jsonc[]
----
====

That result might have been surprising since some symbols come before letters and are therefore "lower" than letters.
To avoid this symbol confusion, you can specify letters only, as in the following example.

.Min of a string field, regardless of preceding non-letters
====
Find the first hotel alphabetically in the `hotel` keyspace:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$functions/min-filter.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$functions/min-filter.jsonc[]
----
====

[[stddev,STDDEV()]]
== [[stddev_distinct]]STDDEV( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

=== Return Value

With the `ALL` quantifier, or no quantifier, returns the <<eqn_samp_std_dev,corrected sample standard deviation>> of all the number values in the group.

----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "StdDevSingle": 0 <1>
  }
]
----

<1> There is only one matching result in the input, so the function returns `0`.

[[stddev_samp,STDDEV_SAMP()]]
== [[stddev_samp_distinct]]STDDEV_SAMP( {startsb} ALL | DISTINCT {endsb} `expression`)

A near-synonym for <<stddev>>.
The only difference is that `STDDEV_SAMP()` returns NULL if there is only one matching element.

=== Example
