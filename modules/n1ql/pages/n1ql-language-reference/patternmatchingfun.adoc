= Pattern-matching functions

Pattern-matching functions allow you to work determine if strings contain a regular expression pattern.
You can also find the first position of a regular expression pattern and replace a regular expression with another.

REGEXP_CONTAINS(expression, pattern)

Returns True if the string value contains the regular expression pattern.

REGEXP_LIKE(expression, pattern)

Returns True if the string value matches the regular expression pattern.

REGEXP_POSITION(expression, pattern)

Returns first position of the regular expression pattern within the string, or -1.

REGEXP_REPLACE(expression, pattern, repl [, n ])

Returns new string with occurrences of pattern replaced with _repl_.
If n is given, at most n replacements are performed.
