{description}

Roles can be of the following two types:

[cols="100,733"]
|===
| *simple*
| Roles which apply generically to all buckets/resources in the cluster.

For example: `ClusterAdmin` or `BucketAdmin`

| *parameterized by a bucket*
| Roles which are defined for the scope of the specified bucket only.
The bucket name is specified after ON.

For example: `pass:c[BucketReader ON `travel-sample`]`

or `pass:c[Query_Select ON `travel-sample`]`
|===

NOTE: Only Full Administrators can run the GRANT statement.
For more details about user roles, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

*Syntax*

----
GRANT role1   [, role2, ...]
   ON bucket1 [, bucket2, ...]
   TO user1   [, user2, ...];
----

*role*::
`RBAC-role[(bucket_name)]`
+
`RBAC-role` is one of the xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[RBAC role names predefined] by Couchbase Server.
+
`RBAC-user` is the user name created by the Couchbase Server RBAC system.
+
The following roles have short forms that can be used as well:

* `query_select → select`
* `query_insert → insert`
* `query_update → update`
* `query_delete → delete`

*bucket*:: The name of your Couchbase or Memcached bucket or buckets.

*user*:: `RBAC-user` in your bucket.

GRANT statements support legacy systems and have two forms:

.1. Unparameterized Roles
[source,json]
----
GRANT Replication Admin, Query External Access
   TO cchaplan, jgleason;

GRANT replication_admin, query_external_access
   TO cchaplan, jgleason;
----

.2. Parameterized Roles
[source,json]
----
GRANT Query Select, Views Admin
   ON orders, customers
   TO bill, linda;

GRANT query_select, views_admin
   ON orders, customers
   TO bill, linda;
----

NOTE: Mixing of parameterized and unparameterized roles or syntax is not allowed and will create an error.

*Example 1*:  Grant the role of Cluster Administrator to three people.

[source,json]
----
GRANT ClusterAdmin TO david, michael, robin;
----

*Example 2*: Grant the roles of Cluster Administrator and Bucket Reader in the Travel Sample bucket to Debby.

[source,json]
----
GRANT ClusterAdmin, BucketReader ON `travel-sample` TO debby;
----
