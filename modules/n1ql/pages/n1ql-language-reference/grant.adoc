[abstract]
The GRANT statement allows granting any RBAC roles to a specific user.

Roles can be of the following two types:

simple::
Roles which apply generically to all keyspaces or resources in the cluster.
+
For example: `ClusterAdmin` or `BucketAdmin`

parameterized by a keyspace::
Roles which are defined for the scope of the specified keyspace only.
The keyspace name is specified after ON.
+
For example: `pass:c[DataReader ON `travel-sample`]` +
or `pass:c[Query_Select ON `travel-sample`]`

NOTE: Only Full Administrators can run the GRANT statement.
For more details about user roles, see {authorization-overview}[Authorization].

* `query_insert → insert`
* `query_update → update`
* `query_delete → delete`

user::
A user name created by the Couchbase Server RBAC system.

=== Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= {logical-hierarchy}[collection] | ( [ {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] ':' ] {logical-hierarchy}[bucket] [ '.' {logical-hierarchy}[scope] '.' {logical-hierarchy}[collection] ] )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/full-keyspace-ref.png["collection | ( ( namespace ':' )? bucket ( '.' scope '.' collection )? )"]

The simple name or fully-qualified name of a keyspace.
Refer to the {keyspace-ref}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

== Usage

GRANT statements support legacy systems and have two forms:

.{counter:form}. Unparameterized Roles
[source,json]
----
GRANT Replication Admin, Query External Access
   TO cchaplan, jgleason;

GRANT replication_admin, query_external_access
   TO cchaplan, jgleason;
----

.{counter:form}. Parameterized Roles
[source,json]
----
GRANT Query Select, Views Admin
   ON orders, customers
   TO bill, linda;

GRANT query_select, views_admin
   ON orders, customers
   TO bill, linda;
----

NOTE: Mixing of parameterized and unparameterized roles or syntax is not allowed and will create an error.
