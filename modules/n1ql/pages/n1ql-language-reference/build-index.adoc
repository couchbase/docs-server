= BUILD INDEX
:description: The BUILD INDEX statement enables you to build one or more GSI indexes that are marked for deferred building all at once.

{description}

By default, CREATE INDEX statement starts building the created index.
However for more efficient building of multiple indexes, CREATE INDEX command can mark indexes for deferred building using the `defer_build:true` option.
BUILD INDEX is capable of building multiple indexes at once, and can utilize a single scan of documents in the bucket to feed many index build operations.

BUILD INDEX is an asynchronous operation.
BUILD INDEX creates a task to build the primary or secondary GSI indexes and returns as soon as the task is queued for execution.
The full index creation operation happens in the background.
Indexes of type GSI provide a status field and mark index status pending while the index build operation is in progress.
This status field and other index metadata can be queried using `system:indexes`.

BUILD INDEX is also idempotent.
On execution, the statement only builds indexes which have not already been built.
If any of the indexes specified by BUILD INDEX have already been built, BUILD INDEX skips those indexes.

When building an index which has automatic index replicas, all of the replicas are also built as part of the BUILD INDEX statement, without having to manually specify them.

===== RBAC Privileges

User executing the BUILD INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace/bucket.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

[IMPORTANT]
.Known Issue
====
If multiple index building operations are kicked off without waiting for all indexes to get to the online state, index building for some indexes might fail.
In this case, `system:indexes` output might report an error similar to the following:

[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-error.jsonc[]
----

To work around this issue, wait for index building to complete (that is, for all indexes to get to the online state), then issue the BUILD INDEX command again.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
build-index ::= BUILD INDEX ON <<keyspace-ref>> '(' <<index-term>> [ ',' <<index-term>> ]* ')' [ <<index-using>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/build-index.png["'BUILD' 'INDEX' 'ON' keyspace-ref '(' index-term (',' index-term)* ')' index-using?"]

[[keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref]]
=== Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= [ namespace ':' ] keyspace
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/from-keyspace-ref.png["(namespace ':')? keyspace"]

namespace::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-heirarchy[namespace] of the bucket to be indexed.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

keyspace::
(Required) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the bucket name or xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-hierarchy[keyspace].
It specifies the bucket as the source for which the index needs to be created.

For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

[[index-term,index-term]]
=== Index Term

[subs="normal"]
----
index-term ::= <<index-name>> | <<index-expr>> | <<subquery-expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-term.png["index-name | index-expr | subquery-expr"]

You can specify one index term, or multiple index terms separated by commas.
An index term must be specified for each index to be built.

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, each index term may be an index name, an expression, or a subquery.
The BUILD INDEX clause may contain a mixture of the different types of index term.

[[index-name,index-name]]
==== Index Name

An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the name of an index.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`(ix1, ix2, ix3);
----
====

[[index-expr,index-expr]]
==== Index Expression

An xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[expression] that may be a string, or an array of strings, each referring to the name of an index.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`('ix1', 'ix2', 'ix3');
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`(['ix1', 'ix2', 'ix3']);
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`('ix1', ['ix2', 'ix3'], ['ix4']);
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
--
Arrays of identifiers are _not_ permitted.

[source,n1ql]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`([ix1, ix2, ix3]);
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`([ix1], [ix2, ix3]);
----
--

[[subquery-expr,subquery-expr]]
==== Subquery Expression

[subs="normal"]
----
subquery-expr ::= '(' xref:n1ql-language-reference/selectclause.adoc[select] ')'
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/subquery-expr.png["'(' select ')'"]

Use parentheses to specify a subquery.

The subquery must return an array of strings, each string representing the name of an index.
See <<ex-build-idx-all>> for details.

For more details and examples, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/selectclause.adoc[SELECT Clause] and xref:n1ql-language-reference/subqueries.adoc[Subqueries].

[[index-using,index-using]]
=== USING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-using ::= USING GSI
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-using.png["'USING' 'GSI'"]

The index type for a deferred index build must be Global Secondary Index (GSI).
The `USING GSI` keywords are optional and may be omitted.

== Examples

[[ex-create-idx-defer]]
.Create deferred indexes
====
Create a set of primary and secondary indexes on the `travel-sample` bucket with the `defer_build` option.

[source,n1ql]

include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-1.n1ql[]
----

----

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-3.n1ql[]
----
====

[[ex-check-idx-defer]]
.Check deferred index status
====
Query `system:indexes` for the status of an index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.jsonc[]
----
====

<1> The `travel-sample-type-index` is in the pending state (deferred).

[[ex-build-idx-single]]
.Build a named index
====
Kick off a deferred build using the index name.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-single.n1ql[]
----
====

[[ex-build-idx-all]]
.Build all indexes
====
Alternatively, kick off all deferred builds in the keyspace, using a subquery to find the deferred builds.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-all.n1ql[]
----
====

<1> One set of parentheses delimits the whole group of index terms, and another set of parentheses delimits the subquery.
In this case there is a double set of parentheses, as the subquery is the only index term.

<2> The `RAW` keyword forces the subquery to return a flattened array of strings, each of which refers to an index name.

[[ex-check-idx-online]]
.Check online index status
====
Query `system:indexes` for the status of an index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-online.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-online.jsonc[]
----
====

<1> The index has now been created.
