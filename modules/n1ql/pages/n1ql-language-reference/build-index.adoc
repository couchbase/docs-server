{description}

By default, CREATE INDEX starts building the created index after the creation stage is complete.
However for more efficient building of multiple indexes, CREATE INDEX can mark indexes for deferred building using the `defer_build:true` option.
BUILD INDEX is capable of building multiple indexes at once, and can utilize a single scan of documents in the keyspace to feed many index build operations.

BUILD INDEX is an asynchronous operation.
BUILD INDEX creates a task to build the primary or secondary GSI indexes and returns as soon as the task is queued for execution.
The full index build operation happens in the background.

Index metadata provides a state field.
The index state may be `scheduled for creation`, `deferred`, `building`, `pending`, `online`, `offline`, or `abridged`.
This state field and other index metadata can be queried using {querying-indexes}[system:indexes].
You can also monitor the index state using the Couchbase Web Console.

If you attempt to build an index which is still scheduled for background creation, the request fails.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you kick off multiple index build operations concurrently, then you may sometimes see transient errors similar to the following.

[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-error.jsonc[]
----

To work around this issue, wait for index building to complete (that is, for all indexes to get to the online state), then issue the BUILD INDEX command again.
====

BUILD INDEX is also idempotent.
On execution, the statement only builds indexes which have not already been built.
If any of the indexes specified by BUILD INDEX have already been built, BUILD INDEX skips those indexes.

When building an index which has automatic index replicas, all of the replicas are also built as part of the BUILD INDEX statement, without having to manually specify them.

== Prerequisites

[discrete]
===== RBAC Privileges

User executing the BUILD INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace.

// TODO: Automatic links in EBNF.

keyspace-ref:: (Required) Specifies the keyspace where the indexes are built.
Refer to <<keyspace-ref>> below.

index-term:: (Required) Specifies the indexes to build.
Refer to <<index-term>> below.

index-using:: (Optional) Specifies the index type.
Refer to <<index-using>> below.

[[keyspace-ref]]
=== Keyspace Reference

The simple name or fully-qualified name of the keyspace on which to build the index.
Refer to the {keyspace-ref}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

[[index-term]]
=== Index Term

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=index-term]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-term.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

You can specify one index term, or multiple index terms separated by commas.
An index term must be specified for each index to be built.

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, each index term may be an <<index-name>>, an <<index-expr>>, or a <<subquery-expr>>.
The BUILD INDEX clause may contain a mixture of the different types of index term.

[[index-name,index name]]
==== Index Name

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=index-name]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-name.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the name of an index.

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline(ix1, ix2, ix3);
----
====

[[index-expr,index expression]]
==== Index Expression

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=index-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-expr.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

An {expression}[expression] that may be a string, or an array of strings, each referring to the name of an index.

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline('ix1', 'ix2', 'ix3');
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline(['ix1', 'ix2', 'ix3']);
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline('ix1', ['ix2', 'ix3'], ['ix4']);
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Arrays of identifiers are _not_ permitted.

[source,sqlpp]
----
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline([ix1, ix2, ix3]);
BUILD INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline([ix1], [ix2, ix3]);
----
====

[[subquery-expr,subquery expression]]
==== Subquery Expression

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=subquery-expr]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/subquery-expr.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Use parentheses to specify a subquery.

The subquery must return an array of strings, each string representing the name of an index.
See <<ex-build-idx-all>> for details.

For more details and examples, see {selectclause}[SELECT Clause] and {subqueries}[Subqueries].

[[index-using]]
=== USING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=index-using]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-using.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

The index type for a deferred index build must be Global Secondary Index (GSI).
The `USING GSI` keywords are optional and may be omitted.

== Examples

[[ex-create-idx-defer]]
.Create deferred indexes
====
Create a set of primary and secondary indexes in the `landmark` keyspace with the `defer_build` option.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-1.n1ql[]
----

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-2.n1ql[]
----

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-3.n1ql[]
----
====

[[ex-check-idx-defer]]
.Check deferred index status
====
Query `system:indexes` for the status of an index.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.jsonc[]
----
====

<1> The index is in the deferred state.

[[ex-build-idx-single]]
.Build a named index
====
Kick off a deferred build using the index name.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-single.n1ql[]
----
====

[[ex-build-idx-all]]
.Build all indexes
====
Alternatively, kick off all deferred builds in the keyspace, using a subquery to find the deferred builds.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-all.n1ql[]
----

Note that it is only possible to kick off all deferred builds in a single collection -- it is not possible to kick off all deferred builds in all collections in all scopes within a bucket.
====

<1> One set of parentheses delimits the whole group of index terms, and another set of parentheses delimits the subquery.
In this case there is a double set of parentheses, as the subquery is the only index term.

<2> The `RAW` keyword forces the subquery to return a flattened array of strings, each of which refers to an index name.

[[ex-check-idx-online]]
.Check online index status
====
Query `system:indexes` for the status of an index.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-online.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-online.jsonc[]
----
====

<1> The index has now been created.
