= LIMIT clause

[abstract]
The `LIMIT` clause specifies the maximum number of objects to be returned in a resultset by a `SELECT` statement.

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

[#section_blb_qhx_2cb]
== Purpose

When you don't need the entire resultset, use the `LIMIT` clause to specify the maximum number of objects to be returned in a result set by a `SELECT` query.

A negative value is the same as `LIMIT 0`.

NOTE: Starting from version 4.5, the `LIMIT` clause in DML statements is no longer a hint.
It indicates that the actual number of mutations will be less than or equal to the specified `LIMIT`.
