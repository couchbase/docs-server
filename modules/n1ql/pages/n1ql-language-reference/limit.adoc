{description}

== Purpose

When you don't need the entire resultset, use the `LIMIT` clause to specify the maximum number of documents to be returned in a resultset by a `SELECT` query.

The `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are evaluated after the `ORDER BY` clause.

(((pagination)))
You can use the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` clauses together to [def]_paginate_ the results -- that is, to split the resultset into pages, each containing a specified number of documents, for display purposes.

NOTE: Starting from version 4.5, the LIMIT clause in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements is no longer a hint.
It indicates that the actual number of mutations will be less than or equal to the specified LIMIT.
