= LIMIT clause
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
The `LIMIT` clause specifies the maximum number of documents to be returned in a resultset by a `SELECT` statement.

== Purpose

When you don't need the entire resultset, use the `LIMIT` clause to specify the maximum number of documents to be returned in a resultset by a `SELECT` query.

The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are evaluated after the ORDER BY clause.

A negative value is the same as `LIMIT 0`.

NOTE: Starting from version 4.5, the `LIMIT` clause in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements is no longer a hint.
It indicates that the actual number of mutations will be less than or equal to the specified `LIMIT`.
