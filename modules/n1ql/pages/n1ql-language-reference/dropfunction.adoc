== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
drop-function ::= DROP FUNCTION <<name,name>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/drop-function.png["'DROP' 'FUNCTION' name"]

[[name]]
name::
The name of the function.
This may be an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`, or a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must delete the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

== Usage

When you drop an external user-defined function, the JavaScript library and function on which the user-defined function depended are not deleted.
This enables you to create a new user-defined function with a different name, or a different number of parameters, using the same JavaScript library and function.

To change or delete the JavaScript library and the JavaScript function, you must use the N1QL Functions REST API.
For details, refer to xref:n1ql-rest-api/functions.adoc[Functions REST API].

== Examples

.Drop an inline function
====
This statement deletes an inline function called `celsius`.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP FUNCTION celsius;
----

You can run the following query to check that the function is no longer available.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM system:functions;
----
====

.Drop an external function
====
This statement deletes an external function called `javaScriptAdd`, which depends on a JavaScript function called `add` in a library called `math`.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP FUNCTION javaScriptAdd;
----

You can run the following command to check that the JavaScript `add` function and `math` library are still available.

[source,console]
----
$ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8093/functions/v1/libraries -H 'content-type: application/json' -u Administrator:password
----
