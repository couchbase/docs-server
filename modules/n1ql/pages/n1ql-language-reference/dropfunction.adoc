== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
drop-function ::= DROP FUNCTION <<name,function>> [ IF EXISTS ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/drop-function.png["'DROP' 'FUNCTION' function ( 'IF' 'EXISTS' )?"]

[[name]]
=== Function Name

[subs="normal"]
----
function ::= [ __namespace__ ':' [ __bucket__ '.' __scope__ '.' ] ] __identifier__
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/function.png["( namespace ':' ( bucket '.' scope '.' )? )? identifier"]

The name of the function.
This is usually an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`.
In this case, the path to the function is determined by the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#query-context[query context].

To delete a global function in a particular namespace, the function name must be a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.
Similarly, to delete a scope function in a particular scope, the function name must be a qualified identifier with the full path to a scope, such as `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.func1`.
Refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc#context[Global Functions and Scope Functions] for more information.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must delete the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

== Checking for an Existing Function

The optional `IF EXISTS` keywords enable you to check whether the specified function exists before dropping it.

When the function does not exist within the specified context:
footnote:context[That is, you are dropping a global function, and the function does not exist within the specified namespace; or, you are dropping a scope function, and and the function does not exist within the specified scope.]

* If these keywords are present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

* If these keywords are not present, an error is generated.

== Usage

When you drop an external user-defined function, the JavaScript library and function on which the user-defined function depended are not deleted.
This enables you to create a new user-defined function with a different name, or a different number of parameters, using the same JavaScript library and function.

To change or delete the JavaScript library and the JavaScript function, you must use the N1QL Functions REST API.
For details, refer to xref:n1ql-rest-api/functions.adoc[Functions REST API].

== Examples

.Drop an inline function
====
This statement deletes an inline function called `celsius`.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP FUNCTION celsius;
----

You can run the following query to check that the function is no longer available.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM system:functions;
----
====

.Drop an external function
====
These statements delete two external functions:

. A function called `geohash`, which depends on the JavaScript `encodeGeoHash` function in the `geohash-js` library;
. A function called `adjacent`, which depends on the JavaScript `calculateAdjacent` function in the `geohash-js` library.

[source,n1ql]
----
DROP FUNCTION geohash;

DROP FUNCTION adjacent;
----

You can run the following command to check that the JavaScript `geohash-js` library and the `encodeGeoHash` and `calculateAdjacent` functions are still available.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X GET \
http://localhost:8093/evaluator/v1/libraries/geohash-js \
-u Administrator:password
