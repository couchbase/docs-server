== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
create-scope ::= CREATE SCOPE [ _namespace_ ':' ] _bucket_ '.' _scope_
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-scope.png["create-scope ::= 'CREATE' 'SCOPE' ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope"]

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket in which you want to create the scope.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket in which you want to create the scope.

scope::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the scope that you want to create.
Refer to {naming-for-scopes-and-collections}[Naming for Scopes and Collections] for restrictions on scope names.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name or the scope name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

== Example

====
This statement creates a scope called `events` in the `travel-sample` bucket.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE SCOPE `travel-sample`.events
