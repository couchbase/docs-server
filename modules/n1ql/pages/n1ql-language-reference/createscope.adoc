== Syntax

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket in which you want to create the scope.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the bucket in which you want to create the scope.

scope::
(Required) An {identifier}[identifier] that refers to the name of the scope that you want to create.
Refer to {naming-for-scopes-and-collections}[Naming for Scopes and Collections] for restrictions on scope names.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name or the scope name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

=== Checking for an Existing Scope

The optional `IF NOT EXISTS` modifier enables you to check whether a scope exists before creating it.
If a scope with the same name already exists within the specified bucket, then:

* If this modifier is not present, an error is generated.

* If this modifier is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Example

====
This statement creates a scope called `events` in the `travel-sample` bucket.
