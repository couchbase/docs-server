The `CREATE SCOPE` statement enables you to create a scope.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
create-scope ::= 'CREATE' 'SCOPE' ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-scope.png["create-scope ::= 'CREATE' 'SCOPE' ( namespace ':' )? bucket '.' scope"]

namespace::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-heirarchy[namespace] of the bucket in which you want to create the scope.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the bucket in which you want to create the scope.

scope::
(Required) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the name of the scope that you want to create.
Refer to xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#naming-for-scopes-and-collection[Naming for Scopes and Collections] for restrictions on scope names.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside the bucket name or the scope name, you must wrap that part of the path in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

== Example

====
This statement creates a scope called `places` in the `travel-sample` bucket.
