GROUP BY allows you to organize a result set by one or more expressions.
It can be used with aggregate functions to group the result set.
The optional LETTING and HAVING clauses follow the GROUP BY clause.

Example

----
SELECT relation, COUNT(*) AS count
    FROM tutorial
        GROUP BY relation
----

Results

----
{
  "results": [
    {
      "count": 2,
      "relation": "friend"
    },
    {
      "count": 1,
      "relation": "coworker"
    },
    {
      "count": 1,
      "relation": "parent"
    },
    {
      "count": 2,
      "relation": "cousin"
    }
  ]
}

Example

----
SELECT title, type, COUNT(*) AS count FROM catalog GROUP BY type
----

*LETTING Clause*

----
LETTING  alias = expression [(, alias = expression) ]*
----

Aliases in the LETTING clause create new names that can be referred to in the HAVING, SELECT, and ORDER BY clauses.

*HAVING Clause*

----
HAVING condition
----

The HAVING clause optionally follows the GROUP BY clause.
It filters result objects from the GROUP BY clause using the given condition.
