{description}

== Purpose

Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange aggregate values into groups of one or more fields.
This `GROUP BY` clause follows the `WHERE` clause and precedes the optional `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
group-by-clause ::= GROUP BY <<group-term>> [ ',' <<group-term>> ]* [ <<letting-clause>> ] [ <<having-clause>> ] | <<letting-clause>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/group-by-clause.png["'GROUP' 'BY' group-term ( ',' group-term )* letting-clause? having-clause? | letting-clause"]

[[group-term,group-term]]
=== Group Term

[subs="normal"]
----
group-term ::= <<group-term-args,expr>> [ [ AS ] <<alias>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/group-term.png["expr ( ('AS')? alias )?"]

At least one group term is required.

[#group-term-args]
expr:: String or expression representing an xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] or field to group together.

[[alias,alias]]
=== AS Alias

ifeval::['{page-component-version}' == '6.5']
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 6.5)_
endif::[]

Assigns another name to the group term.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the group term is optional.
If you assign an alias, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[letting-clause,letting-clause]]
=== LETTING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
letting-clause ::= LETTING <<letting-clause-args,alias>> '=' <<letting-clause-args,expr>> [ ',' <<letting-clause-args,alias>> '=' <<letting-clause-args,expr>> ]*
----

image:n1ql-language-reference/letting-clause.png["'LETTING' alias '=' expr (',' alias '=' expr)*"]

[Optional] Stores the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.

[#letting-clause-args]
alias:: String or expression representing the name of the clause to be referred to.

expr:: String or expression representing the value of the `LETTING` [.var]`alias` variable.

[[having-clause,having-clause]]
=== HAVING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
having-clause ::= HAVING <<having-clause-args,cond>>
----

image:n1ql-language-reference/having-clause.png["'HAVING' cond"]

[Optional] To return items where xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate] values meet the specified conditions.

[#having-clause-args]
cond:: String or expression representing the clause of aggregate values.

== Limitations

`GROUP BY` works only on a group key or xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function].

A query needs a predicate on a leading index key to ensure that the optimizer can select a secondary index for the query.
Without a matching predicate, the query will use the primary index.
The simplest predicate is `WHERE _leading-index-key_ IS NOT MISSING`.
This is usually only necessary in queries which do not otherwise have a WHERE clause; for example, some GROUP BY and aggregate queries.
For more details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc#index-selection[Index Selection].

== Examples

.Group the unique landmarks by city and list the top 4 cities with the most landmarks in descending order
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY LandmarkCount DESC
LIMIT 4;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "Los Angeles",
    "LandmarkCount": 284
  },
  {
    "City": "San Diego",
    "LandmarkCount": 197
  }
]
----
====

.Use LETTING to find cities that have a minimum number of things to see
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
LETTING MinimumThingsToSee = 400
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT name) > MinimumThingsToSee;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  }
]
----
====

.Use HAVING to specify cities that have more than 180 landmarks
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT name) > 180;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "Los Angeles",
    "LandmarkCount": 284
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "San Diego",
    "LandmarkCount": 197
  }
]
----
====

NOTE: The above `HAVING` clause must use the xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] `COUNT` instead of its alias `LandmarkCount`.

.Use HAVING to specify landmarks that begin with an "S" or higher
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
HAVING city > "S";
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "City": "Santa Barbara",
    "LandmarkCount": 53
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "Stable Yd",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Wembley",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
...

.Using WHERE yields the same results as HAVING, however, WHERE is faster
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
AND city > "S"
GROUP BY city
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "City": "San Luis Obispo",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Twentynine Palms",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Westlake Village",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Surrey",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
...
----

(execution: 386.857082ms docs: 138)
====

NOTE: The `WHERE` clause is faster because `WHERE` gets processed _before_ any `GROUP BY` and doesn't have access to aggregated values.
`HAVING` gets processed _after_ `GROUP BY` and is used to constrain the resultset to only those with aggregated values.

.Using an alias for a group term
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT Hemisphere, COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample` AS l
WHERE type="landmark"
GROUP BY CASE
  WHEN l.geo.lon <0 THEN "West"
  ELSE "East"
END AS Hemisphere;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "Hemisphere": "East",
    "LandmarkCount": 459
  },
  {
    "Hemisphere": "West",
    "LandmarkCount": 3885
  }
]
----
====

NOTE: The `CASE` expression categorizes each landmark into the Western hemisphere if its longitude is negative, or the Eastern hemisphere otherwise.
The alias in the `GROUP BY` clause enables you to refer to the `CASE` expression in the `SELECT` clause.
