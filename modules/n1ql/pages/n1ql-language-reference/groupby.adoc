{description}

== Purpose

Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange aggregate values into groups of one or more fields.
This `GROUP BY` clause follows the `WHERE` clause and precedes the optional `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

== Syntax

[[group-term]]
=== Group Term

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=group-term]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/group-term.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

At least one group term is required.

[#group-term-args]
expr:: String or expression representing an xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] or field to group together.

alias:: Assigns another name to the group term.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the group term is optional.
If you assign an alias, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[letting-clause]]
=== LETTING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=letting-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/letting-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] Stores the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.

[#letting-clause-args]
alias:: String or expression representing the name of the clause to be referred to.

expr:: String or expression representing the value of the `LETTING` [.var]`alias` variable.

[[having-clause]]
=== HAVING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=having-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/having-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] To return items where xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate] values meet the specified conditions.

[#having-clause-args]
cond:: String or expression representing the clause of aggregate values.

== Limitations

`GROUP BY` works only on a group key or xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function].

A query needs a predicate on a leading index key to ensure that the optimizer can select a secondary index for the query.
Without a matching predicate, the query will use the primary index.
The simplest predicate is `WHERE _leading-index-key_ IS NOT MISSING`.
This is usually only necessary in queries which do not otherwise have a WHERE clause; for example, some GROUP BY and aggregate queries.
For more details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc#index-selection[Index Selection].

NOTE: The `WHERE` clause is faster because `WHERE` gets processed _before_ any `GROUP BY` and doesn't have access to aggregated values.
`HAVING` gets processed _after_ `GROUP BY` and is used to constrain the resultset to only those with aggregated values.

NOTE: The `CASE` expression categorizes each landmark into the Western hemisphere if its longitude is negative, or the Eastern hemisphere otherwise.
The alias in the `GROUP BY` clause enables you to refer to the `CASE` expression in the `SELECT` clause.
