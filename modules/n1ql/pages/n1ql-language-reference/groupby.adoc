[#topic_Group_By_clause]
= GROUP BY clause

[abstract]
The GROUP BY clause arranges aggregate values into groups, based on one more fields.

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 4.0)_

== Purpose

Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange aggregate values into groups of one or more fields.
This `GROUP BY` clause follows the `WHERE` clause and precedes the optional `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

== Syntax

image::n1ql-language-reference/images/group-by-clause.png[]

----
GROUP BY expr [, expr2 ]*
  [ LETTING alias = expr [, alias2 = expr2 ]* ]
  [ HAVING cond ]
|
LETTING alias = expr [, alias2 = expr2 ]*
----

== Arguments

expr:: [At least one is required] String or expression representing the xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] or fields to group together.

`LETTING` letting-clause::
[Optional] Stores the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.
image:n1ql-language-reference/images/letting-clause.png[]
alias;; String or expression representing the name of the clause to be referred to.

expr;; String or expression representing the value of the `LETTING` [.var]`alias` variable.

`HAVING` having-clause::
[Optional] To return items where xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate] values meet the specified conditions.
image:n1ql-language-reference/images/having-clause.png[]
cond;; String or expression representing the clause of aggregate values.

== Limitations

`GROUP BY` works only on a group key or xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function].

== Examples

*Example 1: Group the unique landmarks by city and list the top 4 cities with the most landmarks in descending order.*

----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY LandmarkCount DESC
LIMIT 4;
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "Los Angeles",
    "LandmarkCount": 284
  },
  {
    "City": "San Diego",
    "LandmarkCount": 197
  }
]
----

*Example 2: Use LETTING to find cities that have a minimum number of things to see.*

----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
LETTING MinimumThingsToSee = 400
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT name) > MinimumThingsToSee;
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  }
]
----

*Example 3: Use HAVING to specify cities that have more than 180 landmarks.*

----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT name) > 180;
----

Results:

----
[
  {
    "City": "London",
    "LandmarkCount": 443
  },
  {
    "City": "Los Angeles",
    "LandmarkCount": 284
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "San Diego",
    "LandmarkCount": 197
  }
]
----

NOTE: The above `HAVING` clause must use the xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc#topic_8_1[aggregate function] `COUNT` instead of its alias `LandmarkCount`.

*Example 4: Use HAVING to specify landmarks that begin with an "S" or higher.*

----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
GROUP BY city
HAVING city > "S";
----

138 Results in 150ms:

----
[
  {
    "City": "Santa Barbara",
    "LandmarkCount": 53
  },
  {
    "City": "San Francisco",
    "LandmarkCount": 797
  },
  {
    "City": "Stable Yd",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Wembley",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
...
----

*Example 4b: Using WHERE yields the same results as HAVING, however, WHERE is faster.*

----
SELECT city City, COUNT(DISTINCT name) LandmarkCount
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = "landmark"
AND city > "S"
GROUP BY city
----

138 Results in 94ms:

----
[
  {
    "City": "San Luis Obispo",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Twentynine Palms",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Westlake Village",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
  {
    "City": "Surrey",
    "LandmarkCount": 1
  },
...
----

NOTE: The `WHERE` clause is faster because `WHERE` gets processed _before_ any `GROUP BY` and doesn't have access to aggregated values.
`HAVING` gets processed _after_ `GROUP BY` and is used to constrain the resultset to only those with aggregated values.
