{description}
Primary indexes are optional and are only required for running ad hoc queries on a keyspace that is not supported by a secondary index.

In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` allows you to make multiple concurrent index creation requests.
The command starts a task to create the primary index definition in the background.
If there is an index creation task already running, the Index Service queues the incoming index creation request.
`CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` returns as soon as the index creation phase is complete.

By default, when the index creation phase is complete, the Index Service triggers the index build phase.
If you lose connectivity, the index build operation continues in the background.
You can also defer the index build phase using the `defer_build` clause.
In deferred build mode, `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` creates the index definition, but does not trigger the index build phase.
You can then build the index using the {build-index}[BUILD INDEX] command.

Index metadata provides a state field.
The index state may be `scheduled for creation`, `deferred`, `building`, `pending`, `online`, `offline`, or `abridged`.
This state field and other index metadata can be queried using {querying-indexes}[system:indexes].
You can also monitor the index state using the Couchbase Web Console.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you kick off multiple index creation operations concurrently, you may sometimes see transient errors similar to the following.
If this error occurs, the Index Service tries to run the failed operation again in the background until it succeeds, up to a maximum of 1000 retries.

[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-error.jsonc[]
----

If the Index Service still cannot create the index after the maximum number of retries, the index state is marked as `offline`.
You must drop the failed index using the `DROP INDEX` command.
====

You can create multiple identical primary indexes on a keyspace and place them on separate nodes for better index availability.
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, the recommended way to do this is using the `num_replicas` option.
In Couchbase Server Community Edition, you need to create multiple identical indexes and place them using the `nodes` option.
Refer to <<index-with,WITH Clause>> below for more details.

== Prerequisites

[discrete]
===== RBAC Privileges

Users executing the `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
{authorization-overview}[Authorization].

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
create-primary-index ::= CREATE PRIMARY INDEX [ __index-name__ ] ON <<keyspace-ref>>
                         [ <<index-using>> ] [ <<index-with>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-primary-index.png["'CREATE' 'PRIMARY' 'INDEX' index-name? 'ON' keyspace-ref index-using? index-with?"]

index-name::
[Optional] A unique name that identifies the index.
If a name is not specified, the default name of `#primary` is applied.
+
Valid GSI index names can contain any of the following characters: `A-Z` `a-z` `0-9` `&num;` `&lowbar;`, and must start with a letter, [`A-Z` `a-z`].
The minimum length of an index name is 1 character and there is no maximum length set for an index name.
When querying, if the index name contains a `&num;` or `&lowbar;` character, you must enclose the index name within backticks.
+
IMPORTANT: Unnamed primary indexes are dropped by using the `DROP PRIMARY INDEX` statement, and named primary indexes are dropped by using the `DROP INDEX` statement.

[[keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref]]
=== Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= <<keyspace-path>> | <<keyspace-partial>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-ref.png["keyspace-path | keyspace-partial"]

Specifies the keyspace for which the index needs to be created.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside any part of the keyspace reference, you must wrap that part of the keyspace reference in backticks ({backtick}{nbsp}{backtick}).
Refer to the examples below.

[[keyspace-path,keyspace-path]]
==== Keyspace Path

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-path ::= [ __namespace__ ':' ] __bucket__ [ '.' __scope__ '.' __collection__ ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-path.png["( namespace ':' )? bucket ( '.' scope '.' collection )?"]

If the keyspace is a named collection, or the default collection in the default scope within a bucket, the keyspace reference may be a keyspace path.
In this case, the {query-context}[query context] should not be set.

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the keyspace.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[bucket name] of the keyspace.

scope::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[scope name] of the keyspace.
If omitted, the bucket's default scope is used.

collection::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[collection name] of the keyspace.
If omitted, the default collection in the bucket's default scope is used.

====
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the default collection in the default scope in the `travel-sample` bucket in the `default` namespace.

Similarly, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.airline` indicates the `airline` collection in the `inventory` scope in the `travel-sample` bucket in the `default` namespace.
====

[[keyspace-partial,keyspace-partial]]
==== Keyspace Partial

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-partial ::= __collection__
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-partial.png["collection"]

Alternatively, if the keyspace is a named collection, the keyspace reference may be just the collection name with no path.
In this case, you must set the {query-context}[query context] to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.

collection::
(Required) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[collection name] of the keyspace.

====
For example, `airline` indicates the `airline` collection, assuming the query context is set.
====

[[index-using,index-using]]
=== USING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-using ::= USING GSI
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-using.png["'USING' 'GSI'"]

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, the index type for a primary index must be Global Secondary Index (GSI).
The `USING GSI` keywords are optional and may be omitted.

[[index-with,index-with]]
=== WITH Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-with ::= WITH <<index-with-args,expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-with.png["'WITH' expr"]

Use the WITH clause to specify additional options.

[[index-with-args]]
expr::
An object with the following properties:

nodes;;
[Optional] An array of strings, each of which represents a node name.
+
****
[.edition]#{community}#

In Couchbase Server Community Edition, a single primary index of type `GSI` can be placed on a single node that runs the indexing service.
The `nodes` property allows you to specify the node that the index is placed on.
(((default index placement)))If `nodes` is not specified, one of the nodes running the indexing service is randomly picked for the index.
****
+
****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, you can specify multiple nodes to distribute replicas of an index across nodes running the indexing service, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON keyspace_name USING GSI
WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091", "node2:8091", "node3:8091"]};
----

If specifying both [.var]`nodes` and [.var]`num_replica`, the number of nodes in the array must be one greater than the specified number of replicas otherwise the index creation will fail.

(((default index placement)))If [.var]`nodes` is not specified, then the system chooses nodes on which to place the new index and any replicas, in order to achieve the best resource utilization across nodes running the indexing service.
This is done by taking into account the current resource usage statistics of index nodes.
****
+
IMPORTANT: A node name passed to the `nodes` property must include the cluster administration port, by default 8091.
For example `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0:8091"]}` instead of `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0"]}`.

defer_build;;
[Optional] Boolean.

true:::
When set to `true`, the `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index but immediately pauses the building of the index of type `GSI`.
Index building requires an expensive scan operation.
Deferring building of the index with multiple indexes can optimize the expensive scan operation.
Admins can defer building multiple indexes and, using the `BUILD INDEX` statement, multiple indexes to be built efficiently with one efficient scan of keyspace data.

false:::
When set to `false`, the `CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index and immediately kicks off the building of the index of type `GSI`.

num_replica;;
+
****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

This property is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

[Optional] Integer that specifies the number of {index-replication}[replicas] of the index to create.

The indexer will automatically distribute these replicas amongst index nodes in the cluster for load-balancing and high availability purposes.
The indexer will attempt to distribute the replicas based on the server groups in use in the cluster where possible.

If the value of this property is not less than the number of index nodes in the cluster, then the index creation will fail.
****

== Usage

[discrete]
===== Primary Scan Timeout

For a primary index scan on any keyspace size, the query engine guarantees that the client is not exposed to scan timeout if the indexer throws a scan timeout after it has returned a greater than zero sized subset of primary keys.
To complete the scan, the query engine performs successive scans of the primary index until all the primary keys have been returned.
It is possible that the indexer throws scan timeout without returning any primary keys, and in this event the query engine returns scan timeout to the client.

For example, if the indexer cannot find a snapshot that satisfies the consistency guarantee of the query within the timeout limit, it will timeout without returning any primary keys.

For secondary index scans, the query engine does not handle scan timeout, and returns index scan timeout error to the client.
You can handle scan timeout on a secondary index by increasing the indexer timeout setting (See
{query-settings}[Query Settings]) or preferably by defining and using a more selective index.

===== Named Collection

In each of the examples that follow, the path to the required keyspace is specified by the query, so you do not need to set the query context.

.Create a deferred primary index
====
Create a named primary index using the `defer_build` option.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-pri-defer.n1ql[]
----

Query `system:indexes` for the status of the index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-pri-defer.n1ql[]
----

The output from `system:indexes` shows the `idx_hotel_primary` in the deferred state.
====

.Build a deferred primary index
====
Kick off the deferred build on the named primary index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-pri-single.n1ql[]
----

Query `system:indexes` for the status of the index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-pri-online.n1ql[]
----

The output from `system:indexes` shows that the index has now been created.
