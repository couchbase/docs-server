= ORDER BY clause
:imagesdir: ../../assets/images

[abstract]
The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result-set by one or more columns, in ascending or descending order.

[#section_Purpose]
== Purpose

In a `SELECT` statement, the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result-set in ascending or descending order, based on one or more fields or expressions of those fields in the projection.

[#section_Prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

For you to select data from a document or keyspace, you must have the [.param]`query_select` privilege on the document or keyspace.
For more details about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

[[collation]]
=== Collation
The collation clause determines the order of the search.

`ASC`:: The results are ordered in ascending order.

`DESC`:: The results are ordered in descending order.

If the collation clause is missing, the default is `ASC`.

[[nulls-ordering]]
=== Nulls Ordering
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 6.5)_

The nulls ordering clause determines how NULL or MISSING values are treated when ordering the results:

`NULLS FIRST`:: If any results evaluate to NULL or MISSING, those results ordered first.

`NULLS LAST`:: If any results evaluate to NULL or MISSING, those results are ordered last.

If the nulls ordering clause is omitted, the default is `NULLS FIRST` for an ascending search with `ASC`, or `NULLS LAST` for a descending search with `DESC`.

[[arguments]]
== Arguments

expr:: [Required] The identifier or expression by which to order the query results.
This may be a document field, a new expression, or an alias in the SELECT clause.

== Return Values

If no `ORDER BY` clause is specified, the order in which the result objects are returned is undefined.

Objects are sorted first by the left-most expression in the list of expressions.
Any items with the same sort value will be sorted with the next expression in the list.
This process repeats until all items are sorted and all expressions in the list are evaluated.

When a field has a mix of data types, the different JSON types are sorted in the following order, from first to last:

|===
| ASC NULLS FIRST | ASC NULLS LAST | DESC NULLS FIRST | DESC NULLS LAST

| MISSING | FALSE | NULL | BINARY
| NULL | TRUE | MISSING | OBJECT
| FALSE | NUMBER | BINARY | ARRAY
| TRUE | STRING | OBJECT | STRING
| NUMBER | ARRAY | ARRAY | NUMBER
| STRING | OBJECT | STRING | TRUE
| ARRAY | BINARY | NUMBER | FALSE
| OBJECT | MISSING | TRUE | NULL
| BINARY | NULL | FALSE | MISSING
|===

[NOTE]
====
* NULL values include JSON NULL.
* String comparison is done using a raw byte collation of UTF8 encoded strings.
The ascending order is lowercase, then uppercase, then accented letters.
* For arrays, element by element comparison is performed until the end of the shorter array; if all the elements so far are equal, then longer arrays sort after in ascending order.
* For objects, larger objects sort after in ascending order; for objects of equal length, key-value by key-value comparison is performed; keys are examined in sorted order using the normal ordering for strings.
