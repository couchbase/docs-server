The `CURL()` function implements a subset of {url-wiki-curl}[cURL^] functionality and enables N1QL queries to interact and integrate with external JSON data sources available over HTTP/REST.
This allows federated queries against external data sources, such as the {url-google-maps}[Google geocoding API^], {url-yahoo-api}[Yahoo API^], or other Couchbase clusters.
The federated queries can leverage full querying capabilities of N1QL, including functions, expressions, sub-queries, JOINs, NESTs, UNNESTs etc.

The `CURL()` function can be used in various N1QL expressions and in various clauses of the DML statements such as projection, WHERE predicates, FROM data source, and so on.
For example, you can use the CURL function with the INSERT-SELECT statement to import external data into Couchbase Server.

== Syntax

[subs=normal]
....
CURL(__url__, [__options__])
....

=== Arguments

`url`:: A string representing the URL of the data source.
The URL needs to point to a JSON endpoint and must be either `http://` or `https://` only.
No other protocol is supported.
The redirection of URL is not allowed.
`options`:: An optional JSON object representing various supported options.
This includes options and parameters to be sent to the URL source endpoint.

=== Options

.Security Options
[#table_security_options,cols="1,3,2"]
|===
| Option | Description | Value

| `user`
| Server user name and password.
| USERNAME[:PASSWORD]

| `basic`
| Use HTTP Basic Authentication.
| Boolean

| `insecure`
| Allow connections to SSL sites without certificates (H).
| Boolean

| `anyauth`
a|
CURL to figure out authentication method by itself, and use the most secure one.

NOTE: This supports only basic authentication.
| Boolean

| `cacert`
a|
Specify CA signed certificate file name.
Certificates should be stored on the local machine, on each query node within a cluster.

* To store certificates, access [.path]_/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/n1qlcerts_.
This is not visible to the user.
* The file name cannot contain a path.
* If the certificate is not a match to the existing contents of [.path]_n1qlcerts_ directory, the function returns an error.
* All expired and invalid certificates return an error.

| String or [\...string, string….]
|===

=== Return Value
The CURL() function returns either a single JSON object, or multiple objects in an array.
These objects are returned by the HTTP/REST service at the URL.
Note that the result is expected to be JSON, and the function itself doesn't do any additional processing.
However, if the query parameter `pretty=true`, then the data received is in pretty format.
If the returned data from the URL is not a well defined JSON, it may result in errors or undefined behavior.
The errors returned by CURL (such as moved permanently) can be in different formats, like HTML, XML, plain strings, and can be a large blob.
The N1QL function returns a "Not a JSON endpoint" error when it returns any other format other than JSON.

== Security

It is important to understand the potential security implications in using the `CURL()` function.
Note that `CURL()` function can connect to any REST end point accessible to the Query node (where the function is executed) inside or outside the firewall.
To avoid security vulnerabilities, multiple security measures have been implemented.
These can be used to control and minimize the risks associated with using the `CURL()` function.
See <<table_security_options>> for the list of security options that can be used with the `CURL()` function.

In addition to the security options, a Full Administrator can also list URLs and REST endpoints that can be accessed by the `CURL()` function.
The `CURL()` function can access URLs that satisfy a prefix match, which means only URLs specified on the list or the prefixes.

Consider the following use case where a deployment of Couchbase Server and Mobile Sync Gateway exist on the same machine, and the user has access to the query service but not the Sync Gateway admin endpoint.
Let's assume that the user has been granted QUERY_EXTERNAL_ACCESS role by the Full Administrator.
This means that the user can write queries using the CURL() function and potentially use CURL to access the Mobile Sync Gateway admin endpoint.
To avoid this, the Full Administrator can create an access list for CURL() access and add the Admin endpoint of Sync Gateway to the `disallowed_urls` list.

For more details on creating the access list and the structure of the access list file, see <<curl-access-list>>.

The following security measures help control risks when using the `CURL()` function:

* Enable the `CURL()` function only for the Full Administrator role.
* For all other users, the RBAC role QUERY_EXTERNAL_ACCESS is required to run the `CURL()` function.
Only the Full Administrator can assign the QUERY_EXTERNAL_ACCESS role to other users.
* An access list of URLs and REST points must be configured on the query nodes before being able to use the `CURL()` function.
See <<curl-access-list>> for details.
* Each query node in the cluster must define its access list file.
* The `CURL()` function internally supports a specific set of SSL ciphers (MEDIUM or HIGH).
This is dependent on the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`.
* The `CURL()` function runs on the query node within a cluster.
In order to identify a request from N1QL's `CURL()` function, a custom header is always set for all requests.
The custom header format is: `"X-N1QL-User-Agent: couchbase/n1ql/<n1ql-version>"`.
External clients that wish to disallow N1QL `CURL()` from accessing their REST API endpoints can explicitly check for the above header and block it.
The general external endpoints will ignore this header value.
* A `user-agent` is always set by default.
This can be reset using the `-user-agent` option.
The value set by default is `couchbase/n1ql/<n1ql-version>`.
+
NOTE: The current <n1ql-version> is "1.7.0-N1QL".

[#curl-access-list]
=== Creating an Access List for CURL()

An access list allows a Full Administrator to list out the permitted REST endpoints and URLs for the `CURL()` function.
To enable access based on the access list, a Full Administrator must create the file containing the access list, which can be created two ways:

. From the Query Workbench UI in the menu:Settings[Advanced Query Settings] section.
. From CBQ via a cURL command.

==== From the Query Workbench

In the Query Workbench, navigate to the menu:Settings[Advanced Query Settings] section as shown below:

image:n1ql-language-reference/CURL_Access.png[,70%]

After expanding the Advanced Query Settings section, you can choose the Function Access:

Restricted:: Access applies only the sites explicitly listed.
Unrestricted:: Access applies to all sites within the explicitly listed sites.

Under the *Allowed CURL URLs* and *Disallowed CURL URLs* headings, enter your allowed or disallowed URL in the appropriate textbox and press the kbd:[Enter] key or click anywhere else on this screen to enter your URL.

Click btn:[+] to add another URL to the list.

Click btn:[-] to remove a URL from the list.

==== From CBQ

From a CBQ prompt, you can send a CURL() command to allow or disallow specific URLs, for example:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \ -d '{"all_access": true, "allowed_urls" : ["company1.com", "couchbase.com"], "disallowed_urls" : ["company2.com"] }' http://localhost:8091/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist
----

The access list file command structure is described in the following table.

.Structure of Access List for CURL()
include::rest-api:partial$query-settings/definitions.adoc[tag=access]

== Design Considerations

Here are some of the design considerations to keep in mind when using CURL:

* The URL needs to point to a JSON endpoint.
The redirection of URL is not allowed.
* Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported.
This means that files on the local file system cannot be accessed.
* The amount of memory used for the CURL result is controlled using the `result-cap` option.
The default is 20MB.
* Any values passed to the arguments of `CURL()` must be static values.
That means, they cannot include any references to names, aliases of documents, attributes in the documents, or any N1QL functions or expressions that need to be evaluated.
+
Consider the following example:
+
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT CURL(b.url, { "data" : "address="||b.data })
FROM bucket b;
----
+
The above example is invalid, because the first argument `b.url` refers to the alias `b` and the attribute `url` in the document.
In the second argument, the string concatenation operator (||) cannot be evaluated.

== Examples

. <<Ex1,Use Google Maps API to convert static address into coordinates>>
. <<Ex2,Use Google Maps API to extract geometry (address and geographic location bounds) of a given street address>>
. <<Ex3,Join two buckets on different Couchbase clusters>>
. <<Ex4,Full text search (FTS) in a N1QL query>>
. <<Ex5,Use Yahoo Finance API in a WHERE clause to find a stock's lowest value for the day>>
. <<Ex6,Use CURL() to allow two URLs and disallow one URL>>
. <<Ex7,Use CURL() to allow all access to all endpoints>>
. <<Ex8,Use CURL() to turn off access to all endpoints and clear the Allowed and Disallowed lists>>
. <<Ex9,Use CURL() to turn off access to all endpoints but make no changes to the Allowed and Disallowed lists>>
. <<Ex10,Use CURL() to turn off access to all endpoints, allow one URL, and clear the Disallowed list>>
. <<Ex11,Use CURL() to turn off access to all endpoints, disallow one URL, and clear the Allowed list>>
. <<Ex12,Use CURL() to allow an IP address and port instead of a website name>>
. <<Ex13,Use CURL() to allow and disallow the same URL -- and get an error>>
. <<Ex14,Use CURL() with dynamic named parameters>>

The following examples are using CURL in the query projection list.

.Join two buckets on different Couchbase clusters
====
This N1QL query shows how to JOIN two buckets on different Couchbase clusters.
It is same as explained in the xref:n1ql-language-reference/join.adoc[JOIN Clause] example, but with the left and right side buckets for the JOIN are in two different Couchbase clusters.

* The left side bucket `route` is the `pass:c[`travel-sample`]` route documents from cluster running on `hostname`.
If you don't have a second cluster running, you should substitute the `hostname` with 127.0.0.1 or the IP-address of the local cluster.
* The right side bucket `airline` is the `pass:c[`travel-sample`]` airline documents in the local cluster.

Note that the results from the `CURL()` output are embedded in the `results[]` array under the bucket alias `t` used in the remote query.
So, we extract the result documents appropriately with the expression `+CURL(...).results[*].t+` and alias it to `route` as the left side bucket for the `JOIN`.

.Full text search (FTS) in a N1QL query
====
The following example shows how to use the `CURL()` function to include a full text search from the xref:fts:full-text-intro.adoc[Search service] in a N1QL query.
Assuming the FTS index `fts_travel` is created on the bucket `pass:c[`travel-sample`]`, running the following N1QL query finds all documents that have "sanfrancisco" anywhere in the document.

Note that in Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, you can use xref:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc[search functions] to use a full text search in a N1QL query, as long as the Search service is available on the cluster.
You can still use the `CURL()` function if you need to access the Search service on another cluster.

Insert the following documents into the `default` bucket, representing customers and their minimum thresholds, and then run the `SELECT` query:

.Data
[source,n1ql]
----
INSERT INTO `travel-sample` (KEY, VALUE)
  VALUES
     ("k1",
         {"custID" : 12345, "min_threshold" : 4}),
     ("k2",
         {"custID" : 44444, "min_threshold" : 12});
----

.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT min_threshold,
       meta().id,
       to_number(hdp_low) hdp_low
FROM `travel-sample`
USE KEYS ["k1", "k2"]
LET hdp_low = curl("https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql", {"data":"q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(%22HDP%22)&format=json&diagnostics=true&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys&callback="}).query.results.quote.DaysLow
WHERE to_number(hdp_low) < min_threshold;
----

----
[
  {
    "hdp_low": 9.48,
    "id": "k2",
    "min_threshold": 12
  }

.Use CURL() with dynamic named parameters
====
.Query
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT CURL(b.url, $params) FROM bucket b WHERE b.username = "joe";
----

If we wanted to use Node.JS, we would use:

[source,javascript]
----
bucket.query(SELECT CURL(b.url, $params) FROM bucket b WHERE b.username = "joe", { params: { data: "..." } },
 (error, result) => {} );
----

`$params` is a named parameter, so we name it in the parameters object when executing the query.
Then we populate the properties with the data that's in the documents since those properties can be variables.
