== Purpose

The `UPDATE STATISTICS` statement provides a syntax which enables you to gather statistics for an index key expression.

// tag::overview[]
When you use an index with a query, you typically create the index on the fields which the query uses to filter.
To use the cost-based optimizer with that query, you must collect statistics on the same fields that you used to create the index.

A query may have predicates on non-indexed fields, and you can collect statistics on those fields also to help the optimizer.

For a query which filters on an array or array of objects, you must collect the statistics using exactly the same expression that you used to create the index.
// end::overview[]

For this syntax, `UPDATE STATISTICS` and `ANALYZE` are synonyms.
The statement must begin with one of these alternatives.

When using the `UPDATE STATISTICS` keywords, the `FOR` keyword is optional.
Including this keyword makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

When using the `ANALYZE` keyword, the `COLLECTION` or `KEYSPACE` keywords are optional.
Including either of these keywords makes no difference to the operation of the statement.

The simple name or fully-qualified name of the keyspace for which you want to gather statistics.
Refer to the {keyspace-ref}[CREATE INDEX] statement for details of the syntax.

[[index-expr]]
=== Index Expression

The expression for which you want to gather statistics.
This may be any expression that is supported as an index key, including, but not limited to:

* A {expression}[{sqlpp} expression] over any fields in the document, as used in a secondary index.

* An {array-expr}[array expression], as used when creating an array index.

* An {meta-info-expr}[expression with the META() function], as used in a metadata index.

== Result

The statement returns an empty array.

<2> The overall cost estimate for the query.
<3> Cardinality and cost estimates for the index scan operator.
<4> Cardinality and cost estimates for the initial project operator.

[[ex2]]
.Multiple predicates
====
This example uses the same indexes as <<ex1>>.

.Update statistics
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$utility/statistics-expr-predicate.n1ql[tag=update]
----

There is no index on the `free_breakfast` field.
However, the query below refers to this field as a predicate, so we collect statistics on this field also.
