The `CREATE INDEX` statement allows you to create a secondary index.
Secondary indexes contain a filtered or a full set of keys in a given bucket.
Secondary indexes are optional but increase query efficiency on a bucket.

`CREATE INDEX` is by default a synchronous operation,
which means that every `CREATE INDEX` statement blocks until the operation finishes.
Index building starts by creating a task that is queued for index build.
After this phase, if you lose connectivity, the index build operation continues in the background.
You can also run index creation asynchronously using the `defer_build` clause.
In the asynchronous mode, `CREATE INDEX` starts a task to create the index definition, and returns as soon as the task finishes.
You can then build the index using the xref:n1ql-language-reference/build-index.adoc[BUILD INDEX] command.

Both GSI and View indexes provide a status field and mark index status pending.
With GSI indexer, index status continues to report "pending".
This status field and other index metadata can be queried using `system:indexes`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes cannot be built concurrently on a given bucket unless the `defer_build` option of the CREATE INDEX statement is used in combination with BUILD INDEX statement.
The following error is reported if a second index creation operation is kicked off before the completion of the ongoing index creation.

====

You can create multiple identical secondary indexes on a bucket and place them on separate nodes for better index availability.
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, the recommended way to do this is using the `num_replicas` option.
In Couchbase Server Community Edition, you need to create multiple identical indexes and place them using the `nodes` option.
Refer to <<index-with,WITH Clause>> below for more details.

===== RBAC Privileges

User executing the CREATE INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace/bucket.
For more details about user roles, see xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
create-index ::= CREATE INDEX <<index-name>> ON <<named-keyspace-ref>> '(' <<index-key>> [ ',' <<index-key>> ]* ')' [ <<where-clause>> ] [ <<index-using>> ] [ <<index-with>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-index-array.png["'CREATE' 'INDEX' index-name 'ON' named-keyspace-ref '(' index-key ( ',' index-key )* ')' where-clause? index-using? index-with?"]

[[index-name,index-name]]
index-name:: [Required] A unique name that identifies the index.
+
Valid GSI index names can contain any of the following characters: `A-Z` `a-z` `0-9` `&num;` `&lowbar;`, and must start with a letter, [`A-Z` `a-z`].
The minimum length of an index name is 1 character and there is no maximum length set for an index name.
When querying, if the index name contains a `&num;` or `&lowbar;` character, you must enclose the index name within backticks.

[[named-keyspace-ref,named-keyspace-ref]]
=== Named Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= [ namespace ':' ] keyspace
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/from-keyspace.png["(namespace ':')? keyspace"]

namespace::
(Optional) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-heirarchy[namespace] of the bucket to be indexed.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

keyspace::
(Required) An xref:n1ql-language-reference/identifiers.adoc[identifier] that refers to the bucket name or xref:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#logical-hierarchy[keyspace].
It specifies the bucket as the source for which the index needs to be created.

For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the `travel-sample` keyspace in the `default` namespace.

[[index-key,index-key]]
=== Index Key

[subs="normal"]
----
index-key ::= <<index-key-args,expr>> | <<index-key-args,array-expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-key.png["expr | array-expr"]

Refers to an attribute name or a scalar function or an ARRAY expression on the attribute.
This constitutes an index-key for the index.

[[index-key-args]]
expr::
A xref:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[N1QL expression] over any fields in the document.
This cannot use constant expressions, aggregate functions, or sub-queries.

array-expr::
An array expression.
For details about array expressions, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[Array Indexing].

[[where-clause,where-clause]]
=== WHERE Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
where-clause ::= WHERE <<where-clause-args,cond>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/where-clause.png["'WHERE' cond"]

[[where-clause-args]]
cond::
Specifies WHERE clause predicates to qualify the subset of documents to include in the index.

[[index-using,index-using]]
=== USING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-using ::= USING ( VIEW | GSI )
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-using.png["'USING' ( 'VIEW' | 'GSI' )"]

The USING clause specifies the index type to use.
Secondary indexes can be created using global secondary indexes (GSI) or views.

This clause is optional; if omitted, the default is `USING GSI`.

[[index-with,index-with]]
=== WITH Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-with ::= WITH <<index-with-args,expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-with.png["'WITH' expr"]

Use the WITH clause to specify additional options.

[[index-with-args]]
expr::
An object with the following properties:

nodes;;
[Optional] An array of strings, each of which represents a node name.
+
[NOTE,title='{community}']
====
In Couchbase Server Community Edition, a single global secondary index can be placed on a single node that runs the indexing service.
The `nodes` property allows you to specify the node that the index is placed on.
(((default index placement)))If `nodes` is not specified, one of the nodes running the indexing service is randomly picked for the index.
====
+
[NOTE,title='{enterprise}']
====
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, you can specify multiple nodes to distribute replicas of an index across nodes running the indexing service, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
WHERE type="product" USING GSI
WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091", "node2:8091", "node3:8091"]};
----

If specifying both [.var]`nodes` and [.var]`num_replica`, the number of nodes in the array must be one greater than the specified number of replicas otherwise the index creation will fail.

(((default index placement)))If [.var]`nodes` is not specified, then nodes running the index service are randomly selected to host the index, based on the number of replicas.
====
+
IMPORTANT: A node name passed to the `nodes` property must include the cluster administration port, by default 8091.
For example `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0:8091"]}` instead of `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0"]}`.

defer_build;;
[Optional] Boolean.

true:::
When set to `true`, the `CREATE INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index but immediately pauses the building of the index of type GSI.
Index building requires an expensive scan operation.
Deferring building of the index with multiple indexes can optimize the expensive scan operation.
Admins can defer building multiple indexes and, using the `BUILD INDEX` statement, multiple indexes to be built efficiently with one efficient scan of bucket data.

false:::
When set to `false`, the `CREATE INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index and immediately kicks off the building of the index of type GSI.

num_replica;;
+
[title='{enterprise}']
NOTE: This property is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
+
[Optional] Integer that specifies the number of xref:indexes:index-replication.adoc[replicas] of the index to create.
+
The indexer will automatically distribute these replicas amongst index nodes in the cluster for load-balancing and high availability purposes.
The indexer will attempt to distribute the replicas based on the server groups in use in the cluster where possible.
+
If the value of this property is not less than the number of index nodes in the cluster, then the index creation will fail.
+
IMPORTANT: We recommend that you do not create (or drop) secondary indexes when any node with a secondary index role is down as this may result in duplicate index names.

== Usage

=== Array Indexing

Array indexing enables you to create global indexes on array elements and optimize the execution of queries involving array elements.
For details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc[Array Indexing].

=== Using the `meta().id` Function

For details, refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-meta-info.adoc[Indexing Meta Info].

=== Using Indexes for Aggregates

If there is an index on the expression of an aggregate, that index may be used to satisfy the query.
For example, given the index `alt_idx` created using the following statement:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX alt_idx ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt);
----

The query engine will use the index `alt_idx` for the following query:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT MIN(geo.alt), MAX(geo.alt) FROM `travel-sample`;
----

For details, refer to xref:performance:index_pushdowns.adoc#operator-pushdowns[Operator Pushdowns].

== Examples

[[ex-create-idx]]
.Create an index
====
Create a secondary index that contains airports with an `alt` value greater than 1000 on the node `192.0.2.1`.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX over1000 ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt) WHERE geo.alt > 1000 USING GSI WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.1:8091"]};
----
====

[[ex-create-idx-defer]]
