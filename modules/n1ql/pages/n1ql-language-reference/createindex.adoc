The `CREATE INDEX` statement allows you to create a secondary index.
Secondary indexes contain a filtered or a full set of keys in a given bucket.
Secondary indexes are optional but increase query efficiency on a bucket.

`CREATE INDEX` is by default a synchronous operation,
which means that every `CREATE INDEX` statement blocks until the operation finishes.
Index building starts by creating a task that is queued for index build.
After this phase, if you lose connectivity, the index build operation continues in the background.
You can also run index creation asynchronously using the `defer_build` clause.
In the asynchronous mode, `CREATE INDEX` starts a task to create the index definition, and returns as soon as the task finishes.
You can then build the index using the {build-index}[BUILD INDEX] command.

GSI indexes provide a status field and mark index status pending.
With GSI indexer, index status continues to report "pending".
This status field and other index metadata can be queried using `system:indexes`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes cannot be built concurrently on a given bucket unless the `defer_build` option of the CREATE INDEX statement is used in combination with BUILD INDEX statement.
The following error is reported if a second index build operation is kicked off before the completion of the ongoing index build.

[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-error.jsonc[]
----
====

You can create multiple identical secondary indexes on a bucket and place them on separate nodes for better index availability.
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, the recommended way to do this is using the `num_replicas` option.
In Couchbase Server Community Edition, you need to create multiple identical indexes and place them using the `nodes` option.
Refer to <<index-with,WITH Clause>> below for more details.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot run multiple `CREATE INDEX` statements in parallel, even when you specify that the indexes should be created on different nodes.
This is to avoid the possibility of duplicate index names.
====

[discrete]
===== RBAC Privileges

User executing the CREATE INDEX statement must have the _Query Manage Index_ privilege granted on the keyspace/bucket.
For more details about user roles, see
{authorization-overview}[Authorization].

== Syntax

[subs="normal"]
----
create-index ::= CREATE INDEX <<index-name>> ON <<keyspace-ref>> '(' <<index-key>> [ <<index-order>> ] [ ',' <<index-key>> [ <<index-order>> ] ]* ')' [ <<where-clause>> ] [ <<index-using>> ] [ <<index-with>> ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-index-array.png["'CREATE' 'INDEX' index-name 'ON' keyspace-ref '(' index-key index-order? ( ',' index-key index-order? )* ')' where-clause? index-using? index-with?"]

[[index-name,index-name]]
index-name:: [Required] A unique name that identifies the index.
+
Valid GSI index names can contain any of the following characters: `A-Z` `a-z` `0-9` `&num;` `&lowbar;`, and must start with a letter, [`A-Z` `a-z`].
The minimum length of an index name is 1 character and there is no maximum length set for an index name.
When querying, if the index name contains a `&num;` or `&lowbar;` character, you must enclose the index name within backticks.

IMPORTANT: We recommend that you do not create (or drop) secondary indexes when any node with a secondary index role is down, as this may result in duplicate index names.

[[keyspace-ref,keyspace-ref]]
=== Keyspace Reference

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-ref ::= <<keyspace-path>> | <<keyspace-partial>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-ref.png["keyspace-path | keyspace-partial"]

Specifies the keyspace for which the index needs to be created.

NOTE: If there is a hyphen (-) inside any part of the keyspace reference, you must wrap that part of the keyspace reference in backticks ({backtick}{nbsp}{backtick}).
Refer to the examples below.

[[keyspace-path,keyspace-path]]
==== Keyspace Path

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-path ::= [ __namespace__ ':' ] __bucket__ [ '.' __scope__ '.' __collection__ ]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-path.png["( namespace ':' )? bucket ( '.' scope '.' collection )?"]

If the keyspace is a named collection, or the default collection in the default scope within a bucket, the keyspace reference may be a keyspace path.
In this case, the {query-context}[query context] should not be set.

namespace::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the keyspace.
Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If the namespace name is omitted, the default namespace in the current session is used.

bucket::
(Required) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[bucket name] of the keyspace.

scope::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[scope name] of the keyspace.
If omitted, the bucket's default scope is used.

collection::
(Optional) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[collection name] of the keyspace.
If omitted, the default collection in the bucket's default scope is used.

====
For example, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` indicates the default collection in the default scope in the `travel-sample` bucket in the `default` namespace.

Similarly, `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.places.cities` indicates the `cities` collection in the `places` scope in the `travel-sample` bucket in the `default` namespace.
====

[[keyspace-partial,keyspace-partial]]
==== Keyspace Partial

[subs="normal"]
----
keyspace-partial ::= __collection__
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/keyspace-partial.png["collection"]

Alternatively, if the keyspace is a named collection, the keyspace reference may be just the collection name with no path.
In this case, you must set the {query-context}[query context] to indicate the required namespace, bucket, and scope.

collection::
(Required) An {identifiers}[identifier] that refers to the {logical-hierarchy}[collection name] of the keyspace.

====
For example, `cities` indicates the `cities` collection, assuming the query context is set.
====

[[index-key,index-key]]
=== Index Key

[subs="normal"]
----
index-key ::= <<index-key-args,expr>> | <<index-key-args,array-expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-key.png["expr | array-expr"]

Refers to an attribute name or a scalar function or an ARRAY expression on the attribute.
This constitutes an index-key for the index.

[[index-key-args]]
expr::
A {expression}[N1QL expression] over any fields in the document.
This cannot use constant expressions, aggregate functions, or sub-queries.

array-expr::
An array expression.
For details about array expressions, see {indexing-arrays}[Array Indexing].

[[index-order,index-order]]
=== Index Order

[subs="normal"]
----
index-order ::= ASC | DESC
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-order.png["'ASC' | 'DESC'"]

Specifies the sort order of the index key.

`ASC`::
The index key is sorted in ascending order.

`DESC`::
The index key is sorted in descending order.

This clause is optional; if omitted, the default is `ASC`.

[[where-clause,where-clause]]
=== WHERE Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
where-clause ::= WHERE <<where-clause-args,cond>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/where-clause.png["'WHERE' cond"]

[[where-clause-args]]
cond::
Specifies WHERE clause predicates to qualify the subset of documents to include in the index.

[[index-using,index-using]]
=== USING Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-using ::= USING GSI
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-using.png["'USING' 'GSI'"]

In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, the index type for a secondary index must be Global Secondary Index (GSI).
The `USING GSI` keywords are optional and may be omitted.

[[index-with,index-with]]
=== WITH Clause

[subs="normal"]
----
index-with ::= WITH <<index-with-args,expr>>
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/index-with.png["'WITH' expr"]

Use the WITH clause to specify additional options.

[[index-with-args]]
expr::
An object with the following properties:

nodes;;
[Optional] An array of strings, each of which represents a node name.
+
****
[.edition]#{community}#

In Couchbase Server Community Edition, a single global secondary index can be placed on a single node that runs the indexing service.
The `nodes` property allows you to specify the node that the index is placed on.
(((default index placement)))If `nodes` is not specified, one of the nodes running the indexing service is randomly picked for the index.
****
+
****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, you can specify multiple nodes to distribute replicas of an index across nodes running the indexing service, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
WHERE type="product" USING GSI
WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091", "node2:8091", "node3:8091"]};
----

If specifying both [.var]`nodes` and [.var]`num_replica`, the number of nodes in the array must be one greater than the specified number of replicas otherwise the index creation will fail.

(((default index placement)))If [.var]`nodes` is not specified, then the system chooses nodes on which to place the new index and any replicas, in order to achieve the best resource utilization across nodes running the indexing service.
This is done by taking into account the current resource usage statistics of index nodes.
****
+
IMPORTANT: A node name passed to the `nodes` property must include the cluster administration port, by default 8091.
For example `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0:8091"]}` instead of `WITH {"nodes": ["192.0.2.0"]}`.

defer_build;;
[Optional] Boolean.

true:::
When set to `true`, the `CREATE INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index but immediately pauses the building of the index of type GSI.
Index building requires an expensive scan operation.
Deferring building of the index with multiple indexes can optimize the expensive scan operation.
Admins can defer building multiple indexes and, using the `BUILD INDEX` statement, multiple indexes to be built efficiently with one efficient scan of bucket data.

false:::
When set to `false`, the `CREATE INDEX` operation queues the task for building the index and immediately kicks off the building of the index of type GSI.

num_replica;;
+
****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

This property is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

[Optional] Integer that specifies the number of {index-replication}[replicas] of the index to create.

The indexer will automatically distribute these replicas amongst index nodes in the cluster for load-balancing and high availability purposes.
The indexer will attempt to distribute the replicas based on the server groups in use in the cluster where possible.

If the value of this property is not less than the number of index nodes in the cluster, then the index creation will fail.
****

== Usage

=== Array Indexing

Array indexing enables you to create global indexes on array elements and optimize the execution of queries involving array elements.
For details, refer to {indexing-arrays}[Array Indexing].

=== Index Partitioning

Index partitioning helps increase the query performance by dividing and spreading a large index of documents across multiple nodes, horizontally scaling out an index as needed.
For details, refer to {index-partitioning}[Index Partitioning].

=== Using the `meta().id` Function

For details, refer to {indexing-meta-info}[Indexing Meta Info].

=== Using Indexes for Aggregates

If there is an index on the expression of an aggregate, that index may be used to satisfy the query.
For example, given the index `alt_idx` created using the following statement:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX alt_idx ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt);
----

The query engine will use the index `alt_idx` for the following query:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT MIN(geo.alt), MAX(geo.alt) FROM `travel-sample`;
----

For details, refer to {operator-pushdowns}[Operator Pushdowns].

=== Index Replicas

In the {console-indexes}[Indexes screen in the Couchbase Web Console], index replicas are marked with their replica ID.

image::n1ql-language-reference/create-index-replica-id.png["The Indexes screen showing an index and index replica with replica ID"]

If you select `view by server node` from the drop-down menu, you can see the server node where each index and index replica is placed.

You can also query the {querying-indexes}[system:indexes] catalog to find the ID of an index replica and see which node it is placed on.

[NOTE]
====
By default, index replicas are used to serve index scans.
The system automatically load-balances an index scan across the index and all its replicas.
Adding index replicas enables you to scale scan throughput, in addition to providing high availability.
====

== Examples

[[ex-create-idx]]
.Create an index
====
This example creates an index on the default collection in the default scope within the `travel-sample` bucket.
First make sure the {query-context}[query context] is not set.

image::tools:query-workbench-context-unset.png["\UNSET -query_context;"]

Create a secondary index that contains airports with an `alt` value greater than 1000 on the node `127.0.0.1`.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_default_over1000 ON `travel-sample`(geo.alt) WHERE geo.alt > 1000 USING GSI WITH {"nodes": ["127.0.0.1:8091"]};
----
====

[[ex-create-idx-collection]]
.Create an index on a collection with query context
====
This example is similar to <<ex-create-idx>>, but creates an index on the `airport` collection.
First set the {query-context}[query context] to `{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory`.

image::tools:query-workbench-context.png["\SET -query_context 'travel-sample.inventory';"]

Create a secondary index that contains airports with an `alt` value greater than 1000 on the node `127.0.0.1`.

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE INDEX idx_airport_over1000 ON airport(geo.alt) WHERE geo.alt > 1000 USING GSI WITH {"nodes": ["127.0.0.1:8091"]};
----
====

In each of the examples that follow, the path to the required keyspace is specified by the query, so you do not need to set the query context.

[[ex-create-idx-defer]]
.Create a deferred index
====
Create a secondary index with the `defer_build` option.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/create-idx-defer-1.n1ql[]
----

Query `system:indexes` for the status of the index.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/check-idx-defer.jsonc[]
----
====

<1> The index is in the pending state (deferred).

[[ex-build-idx-defer]]
.Build a deferred index
====
Kick off a deferred build using the index name.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::example$n1ql-language-reference/build-idx-single.n1ql[]
----

Query `system:indexes` for the status of the index.

[source,n1ql]
