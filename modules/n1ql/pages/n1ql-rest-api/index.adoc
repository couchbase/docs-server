= N1QL REST API
:page-topic-type: concept
:request-parameters: xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#section_nnj_sjk_k1b

== Overview

N1QL provides a REST API to enable clients to execute N1QL statements.
The REST API runs synchronously, so once execution of the statement in the request is started, results are streamed back to the client, terminating when execution of the statement finishes.
In this section, you will find information about the REST endpoints, request and response parameters, and examples.

The REST endpoints are:

* `+http://node:8093/query/service+`
* `+https://node:18093/query/service+` (for secure access)

where [.var]`node` is the host name or IP address of a computer running the N1QL query engine.

The N1QL REST API query service allows you to execute a N1QL statement.

See xref:n1ql-rest-api/examplesrest.adoc[Examples] for REST API samples.

== Request specification

This section describes how to specify requests.

=== Request format

Here is the format for GET and POST requests.

----
GET /query/service
----

----
POST /query/service
----

=== Request parameters

For a table of request parameters that can be passed in a request to the `/query/service` endpoint with examples, see
{request-parameters}[Request-Level Parameters].

=== Named parameters

If the statement in a request contains named parameters, the request should contain the parameters described in the following table.

.A statement containing named parameters
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = $nval AND age > $aval
----
====

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Value

| `statement`
| `SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = $nval AND age > $aval`

| `$nval`
| "smith"

| `$aval`
| 45
|===

There should be a named parameter in the request for each query parameter in the requestâ€™s statement parameter.

NOTE: The *%* symbol is the escape character in URIs, so when using *%* as a wildcard in a query, we need to escape that by replacing it with its corresponding ASCII code *%25*.

.A statement containing a wildcard parameter
====
[source,shell]
----
$ curl -v http://10.144.210.101:8093/query/service \
  -u Administrator:password \
  -d 'statement=SELECT meta().id
      FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel
      WHERE meta().id LIKE $1 &args=["hotel_1002%25"]'
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": "hotel_10026"
  },
  {
    "id": "hotel_10025"
  }
]
----
====

=== Positional parameters

If the statement in a request contains positional parameters, the request should contain the parameters described in the following table.

.A statement containing positional parameters
====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = $1 AND hiredate > $2
----
====

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Value

| `statement`
| `SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = $1 AND age > $2`

| `args`
| [ "smith", 45 ]
|===

Positional parameters can also be specified in a statement using the question mark (?), so the following statement is an alternative way to specify the same query:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Value

| `statement`
| `SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = ? AND age > ?`

| `args`
| [ "smith", 45 ]
|===

=== Consistency parameters

scan_consistency::

This parameter specifies the consistency guarantee or constraint for index scanning using one of the values listed in the following table.
+
[[table_xmr_grl_lt]]
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Value | Description

| `not_bounded`
| Default value for single-statement requests.

No timestamp vector is used in the index scan.
This is also the fastest mode as we eliminate the cost of obtaining the vector and any wait time for the index to catch up with the vector.

| `at_plus`
| This implements bounded consistency.
The request includes a `scan_vector` parameter and a value, which is used as a lower bound.
This can be used to implement read-your-own-writes (RYOW).

| `request_plus`
| This implements strong consistency per request.
Before processing the request, a current vector is obtained.
The vector is used as a lower bound for the statements in the request.
If there are DML statements in the request, RYOW is also applied within the request.

If `request_plus` is specified in a query that runs during a failover of an index node, the query waits until the rebalance operation completes and the index data has rebalanced before returning a result.

| `statement_plus`
| This implements strong consistency per statement.
Before processing each statement, a current vector is obtained and used as a lower bound for that statement.

| Default behavior
| The default behavior for a single statement is `not_bounded`.
For multi-statement requests, the default behavior is `not_bounded` for the request overall, and RYOW within the request.

Optional: If you want to disable RYOW within a request, add a separate `request_consistency` parameter and set it to [.in]`not_bounded`.
|===

scan_vector::
See `at_plus` parameter in the <<table_xmr_grl_lt,scan_consistency parameters>> table above.

scan_wait::
This parameter is a duration value (units of time) that specifies how much time the indexer is allowed to wait until it can satisfy the required `scan_consistency` and `scan_vector` criteria.
After receiving the scan request, if the indexer is unable to catch up within that duration and initiate the scan, the indexer aborts with an error and the scan fails.

=== Authentication parameters

The Query API supports two types of credentials: local (or bucket) and admin.
The format is an identity and password:

----
[local:] <bucket-name>
[admin:] <admin-name>
<password>
----

Note that identities can be optionally qualified.
Clients passing in bucket names as the identity can prefix them with [.in]`local:`.
This is to provide clarity and future-proofing for all current and future clients of query services.

==== Providing credentials in a request

Credentials can be passed via HTTP headers (HTTP basic authentication) or via the [.param]`creds` request parameter.
If a request contains both HTTP basic authentication header and a [.param]`creds` parameter, the HTTP basic authentication header is ignored and only the [.param]`creds` parameter is used for authenticating.

HTTP headers (HTTP basic authentication) can only be used to provide a single credential.
The [.param]`creds` request parameter contains a JSON array of user/pass objects:

[source,json]
----
creds=[{"user":"...","pass":"..."},{"user":"...","pass":"..."},...]
----

The [.param]`creds` request parameter is the only way to provide multiple credentials for a request.

=== Request content type

For POST requests, you can specify the parameters in the request body in URL-encoded format or JSON format.
For GET requests, you specify the parameters in the request URL in URL-encoded format.
For URL-encoded parameters, the format is consistent with the syntax for variables according to the RFC 6570.

== Response

This section describes the response HTTP status codes.

=== Normal status code

200 OK:: The request completed with or without errors.
Any errors or warnings that occurred during the request will be in the response body.

=== Possible error codes

400 Bad Request:: The request cannot be processed for one of the following reasons:
+
--
* The statement contains a N1QL syntax error.
* The request has a missing or unrecognized HTTP parameter.
* The request is badly formatted (for example, the request body contains a JSON syntax error).
--

401 Unauthorized:: The credentials provided with the request are missing or invalid.

403 Forbidden:: There is a read-only violation.
Either there was an attempt to create or update in a GET request or a POST request where `readonly` is set or the client does not have the authorization to modify an object (index, keyspace or namespace) in the statement.

404 Not Found:: The statement in the request references an invalid namespace or keyspace.

405 Method Not Allowed:: The REST method type in the request is unsupported.

409 Conflict:: There is an attempt to create an object (keyspace or index) that already exists.

410 Gone:: The server is shutting down gracefully.
Previously made requests are being completed, but no new requests are being accepted.

500 Internal Server Error:: There was an unforeseen problem processing the request.

503 Service Unavailable:: There is an issue (that is possibly temporary) preventing the request being processed; the request queue is full or the data store is not accessible.
