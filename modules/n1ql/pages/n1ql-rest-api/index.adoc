= N1QL REST API

[abstract]
N1QL provides a REST API for submitting N1QL queries and statements to the N1QL query engine.

The REST endpoints are:

* `http://node:8093/query/service` (for unsecure access)
* `https://node:18093/query/service` (for secure access)

where [.var]`node` is the host name or IP address of a computer running the N1QL query engine.

The N1QL REST API query service allows you to execute a N1QL statement.

See xref:n1ql-rest-api/executen1ql.adoc[Execute N1QL] for information about executing N1QL and xref:n1ql-rest-api/examplesrest.adoc[Examples] for REST API samples.
