=== Left-Hand Side

The {from-term} cannot be the first term within the `FROM` clause; it must be preceded by another FROM term.
The term immediately preceding the {from-term} represents the _left-hand side_ of the {from-term}.

You can chain the {from-term} with any of the other permitted FROM terms, including another {from-term}.
For more information, see the page on the xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM] clause.

There are restrictions on what types of FROM terms may be chained and in what order -- see the descriptions on this page for more details.

The types of FROM term that may be used as the left-hand side of the {from-term} are summarized in the following table.
