Use the `WITH` clause to specify additional options.

expr::
An object with the following properties:

sample_size;;
[Optional] An integer specifying the sample size to use for distribution statistics.
A minimum sample size is also calculated.
If the specified sample size is smaller than the minimum sample size, the minimum sample size is used instead.

resolution;;
[Optional] A float representing the percentage of documents to store in each distribution bin.
If omitted, the default value is `1.0`, meaning each distribution bin contains 1% of the documents, and therefore 100 bins are required.
The minimum resolution is `0.02` (5000 distribution bins) and the maximum is `5.0` (20 distribution bins).

update_statistics_timeout;;
[Optional] A number representing a duration in seconds.
The command times out when this timeout period is reached.
If omitted, a default timeout value is calculated based on the number of samples used.

batch_size;;
[Optional] Only applies when processing multiple index expressions at once.
If there is a large number of index expressions to process, the cost-based optimizer deals with them in batches.
This option is an integer specifying the maximum number of index expressions in each batch.
If omitted, the default value is `10`.
You can specify a different value based on the memory availability of the system.
Note that when index expressions are processed in batches, the `update_statistics_timeout` value (above) applies to each batch.

Refer to {distribution-stats}[Distribution Statistics] for more information on sample size and resolution.
