Use the `WITH` clause to specify additional options.

expr::
An object with the following properties:

sample_size;;
[Optional] An integer specifying the sample size to use for distribution statistics.
A minimum sample size is also calculated.
If the specified sample size is smaller than the minimum sample size, the minimum sample size is used instead.

resolution;;
[Optional] A float representing the percentage of documents to store in each distribution bin.
If omitted, the default value is `1.0`, meaning each distribution bin contains 1% of the documents, and therefore 100 bins are required.
The minimum resolution is `0.02` (5000 distribution bins) and the maximum is `5.0` (20 distribution bins).

update_statistics_timeout;;
[Optional] A number representing a duration in seconds.
The command times out when this timeout period is reached.
If omitted, a default timeout value is calculated based on the number of samples used.

batch_size;;
[Optional] The maximum number of index expressions to be processed in each pass of histogram construction.
If omitted, the default value is `10`.
You can specify a different value based on memory availability of the system. 
Note that when multiple passes are required to process all index expressions, the update statistics timeout value (see above) applies to each pass.

Refer to {distribution-stats}[Distribution Statistics] for more information on sample size, resolution, and batch size.
