NOTE: xref:n1ql-language-reference/join.adoc#section_ek1_jnx_1db[ANSI JOIN] and xref:n1ql-language-reference/nest.adoc#section_tc1_nnx_1db[ANSI NEST] clauses have much more flexible functionality than their earlier INDEX and LOOKUP equivalents.
Since these are standard compliant and more flexible, we recommend you to use ANSI JOIN and ANSI NEST exclusively, where possible.
