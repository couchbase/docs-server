// tag::windows[]
Window functions are used to compute an aggregate or cumulative value, based on a group of objects.
The objects are not grouped into a single output object â€” each object remains separate in the query output.

All window functions must have a window definition.
This divides the query result set into one or more partitions, and determines the order of objects in those partitions.
Within each partition, a movable window frame is defined for every input object.
The window frame determines the objects to be used by the window function.
// end::windows[]

// tag::functions[]
N1QL has a dedicated set of window functions.
Each window function call includes an OVER clause, which introduces the window specification.
Some window functions take additional window options, which are specified by further clauses before the OVER clause.

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, {aggregatefun}[aggregate functions] can also be used as window functions when they are used with an OVER clause.
// end::functions[]

// tag::syntax[]
In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, window functions (and aggregate functions used as window functions) may specify their own inline window definitions, or they may refer to a named window defined by the WINDOW clause elsewhere in the query.
By defining a named window with the WINDOW clause, you can reuse the window definition across several functions in the query, potentially making the query easier to write and maintain.
