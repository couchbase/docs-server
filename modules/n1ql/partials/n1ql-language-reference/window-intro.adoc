Window functions are used to compute an aggregate or cumulative value, based on a group of objects.
For each input object, a movable window of objects is defined.
The window determines the objects to be used by the window function.

All window functions must have a window clause to define the window partitions, the order of objects within the window, and the size of the window frame.
The `OVER` keyword introduces the window clause.
Some window functions take additional window options, which are specified by further clauses before the window clause.

N1QL has a dedicated set of window functions.
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, aggregate functions can also be used as window functions, when they are used with a window clause.
