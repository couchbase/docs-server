// tag::windows[]
Window functions are used to compute an aggregate or cumulative value, based on a group of objects.
The objects are not grouped into a single output object â€” each object remains separate in the query output.

For each input object, a movable window frame is defined.
The window frame determines the objects to be used by the window function.
// end::windows[]

// tag::syntax[]
All window functions must have a window definition to specify the window partitions, the order of objects within the window, and the extent of the window frame.
The `OVER` clause contains the window definition.
Some window functions take additional window options, which are specified by further clauses before the `OVER` clause.

N1QL has a dedicated set of window functions.
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, aggregate functions can also be used as window functions, when they are used with an `OVER` clause.
