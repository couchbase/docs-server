// tag::windows[]
Window functions are used to compute an aggregate or cumulative value, based on a group of objects.
The objects are not grouped into a single output object â€” each object remains separate in the query output.

All window functions must have a window definition.
This divides the query result set into one or more partitions, and determines the order of objects in those partitions.
Within each partition, a movable window frame is defined for every input object.
The window frame determines the objects to be used by the window function.

// tag::syntax[]
N1QL has a dedicated set of window functions.
Each window function call includes an OVER clause, which introduces the window specification.
Some window functions take additional window options, which are specified by further clauses before the OVER clause.

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, {aggregatefun}[aggregate functions] can also be used as window functions when they are used with an OVER clause.

In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, window functions and aggregate functions used as window functions may specify their own inline window definitions, or they may refer to a named window defined elsewhere in the query.
The WINDOW clause enables you to create named window definitions for this purpose.
With this feature, you can reuse a named window definition between several functions in the same query, potentially making your queries easier to write and maintain.
