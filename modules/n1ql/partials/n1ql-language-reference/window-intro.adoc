// tag::windows[]
Window functions are used to compute an aggregate or cumulative value, based on a group of objects.
The objects are not grouped into a single output object â€” each object remains separate in the query output.

All window functions must have a window definition.
This divides the query result set into one or more partitions, and specifies the order of objects in those partitions.
Within each partition, a movable window frame is defined for every input object.
The window frame determines the objects to be used by the window function.

// tag::syntax[]
The `OVER` clause specifies the window definition.
Some window functions take additional window options, which are specified by further clauses before the `OVER` clause.

N1QL has a dedicated set of window functions.
In Couchbase Server 6.5 and later, aggregate functions can also be used as window functions, when they are used with an `OVER` clause.
