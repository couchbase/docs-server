The OVER clause introduces the window specification for the function.
There are two ways of specifying the window.

* An _inline window definition_ specifies the window directly within the function call.
It is delimited by parentheses `()` and has exactly the same syntax as the window definition in a WINDOW clause.
For further details, refer to {window-definition}[Window Definition].

* A _window reference_ is an {identifier}[identifier] which refers to a named window.
The named window must be defined by a WINDOW clause in the same query block as the function call.
For further details, refer to {window}[WINDOW Clause].
