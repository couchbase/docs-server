:txid: xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#txid

If you are using the Query Workbench or the Query REST API, you must set the {txid}[txid] query parameter to specify the transaction ID.

If you are using the cbq shell, you don't need to specify the transaction ID.
Once you have started a transaction, all statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.
footnote:[You must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above to use the automatic transaction ID functionality.]
