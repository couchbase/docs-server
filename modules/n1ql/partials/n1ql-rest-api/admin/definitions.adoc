|**max-index-api** +
__optional__|[[max-index-api]]
Max index API.
This setting is provided for technical support only.|integer (int32)
|**max-parallelism** +
__optional__|[[max-parallelism-srv]]
Specifies the maximum parallelism for queries on this node.

If the value is zero or negative, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.
Similarly, if the value is greater than the number of allowed cores, the maximum parallelism is restricted to the number of allowed cores.

(The number of allowed cores is the same as the number of logical CPUs.
In Community Edition, the number of allowed cores cannot be greater than 4.
In Enterprise Edition, there is no limit to the number of allowed cores.)

There is also a xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#max_parallelism_req[request-level] `max_parallelism` parameter.
If a request includes this parameter, it will be capped by the server-wide `max-parallelism` setting.

[NOTE]
To enable queries to run in parallel, you must specify the Server-level `max-parallelism` parameter on all Query nodes.

Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index-partitioning.adoc#max-parallelism[Max Parallelism] for more information. +
**Default** : `1` +

|**memprofile** +
__optional__|[[memprofile]]
Filename to write the diagnostic memory usage log.

__optional__|[[prepared-limit]]
Maximum number of prepared statements in the cache.

When this cache reaches the limit, the least recently used prepared statements will be discarded as new prepared statements are created. +
**Default** : `16384` +
**Example** : `65536`|integer (int32)
|**pretty** +
__optional__|[[pretty-srv]]
Specifies whether query results are returned in pretty format.

**Default** : `false` +
**Example** : `true`|boolean
|**profile** +
__optional__|[[profile-srv]]
Specifies if there should be a profile section returned with the request results.
The valid values are:{blank}

`off` -- No profiling information is added to the query response.

`phases` -- The query response includes a profile section with stats and details about various phases of the query plan and execution.
Three phase times will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` monitoring keyspaces.

`timings` -- Besides the phase times, the profile section of the query response document will include a full query plan with timing and information about the number of processed documents at each phase.
This information will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` keyspaces.

[NOTE]
If `profile` is not set as one of the above values, then the profile setting does not change.

Refer to xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc#monitor-profile-details[Monitoring and Profiling Details] for more information and examples. +

__optional__|[[scan-cap-srv]]
Maximum buffered channel size between the indexer client and the query service for index scans.

|**servicers** +
__optional__|[[servicers]]

There is also a xref:settings:query-settings.adoc#timeout_req[request-level] `timeout` parameter.
The minimum of that and the service-level `timeout` setting is applied.

The service-level `timeout` setting is an integer, representing a duration in nanoseconds.
It must not be delimited by quotes, and must not include a unit.

Specify `0` or a negative integer to disable. +
**Default** : `0` +
**Example** : `500000000`|integer (int64)
