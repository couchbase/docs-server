= Understanding Index Scans in Couchbase N1QL Query

[abstract]
During query execution, when the index path is chosen, the query engine requests the scan by providing a range of values to return.
This range is represented as a _span_ in the query plan.
Index scans play a major role in optimizing the query plan generation and execution.
This section discusses how index spans are generated from query predicates and provides a number of examples.

http://www.couchbase.com/[Couchbase N1QL^] is a modern query processing engine designed to provide SQL for JSON on distributed data with a flexible data model.
Modern databases are deployed on massive clusters.
Using JSON provides a flexible data mode, and xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc#n1ql-lang-ref[N1QL supports enhanced SQL for JSON] to make query processing easier.

Applications and database drivers submit the N1QL query to one of the available Query nodes on a cluster.
The Query node analyzes the query, uses metadata on underlying objects to figure out the optimal execution plan, which it then executes.
During execution, depending on the query, using applicable indexes, the Query node works with the Index and Data nodes to retrieve and perform the planned operations.
Because Couchbase is a modular clustered database, you scale out data, index, and query services to fit your performance and availability goals.

This figure shows all the possible phases a SELECT query goes through to return the results.
Not all queries need to go through every phase, some go through many of these phases multiple times.
For example, the Sort phase can be skipped when there is no ORDER BY clause in the query; and the Scan-Fetch-Join phases will execute multiple times for correlated subqueries.

http://blog.couchbase.com/sql-for-documents-n1ql-brief-introduction-to-query-planning[This brief introduction to query planning^] has details of query planner.
When the Index path is chosen, query engine requests the scan by providing the range of values to return.
This range is represented as a SPAN in the query plan.
The index spans will play major roles in optimal plan generation and execution.
Here, we discuss how the Index spans are generated from the query predicates (filters).

[#section_knm_z1k_jbb]
== Spans Overview

FILTER, JOIN, and PROJECT are fundamental operations of database query processing.
The filtering process takes the initial keyspace and produces an optimal subset of the documents the query is interested in.
To produce the smallest possible subset, indexes are used to apply as many predicates as possible.

Query predicates indicate the subsets of data that we are interested in.
During the query planning phase, we select the indexes to be used.
Then, for each index, we decide the predicates to be applied by each index.
The query predicates are translated into spans in the query plan and passed to the Indexer.
Spans simply express the predicates in terms of data ranges.

[NOTE]
====
The examples on this page illustrate the spans for different predicates and require the following indexes.

To run the examples, xref:settings:install-sample-buckets.adoc[install the `travel-sample` sample bucket] and create these indexes:

----
CREATE INDEX idx_id ON `travel-sample`(`id`);

CREATE INDEX idx_name ON `travel-sample`(`name`);

CREATE INDEX idx_s_d_airport_stops ON `travel-sample`(`sourceairport`, `destinationairport`, `stops`);

CREATE INDEX idx_sched ON `travel-sample`(DISTINCT ARRAY v.day FOR v IN schedule END) WHERE type = "route";

== Example Translations

The following table shows some example translations:

[#table_nth_nxp_mx]
|===
| Predicate | Span Low | Span High | Span Inclusion

| id = 10
| 10

| 3 (BOTH)

| id > 10
| 10
| No upper bound
| 0 (NEITHER)

| id \<= 10
| NULL

|===

Consider the plan for the following query:

----
EXPLAIN select meta().id from `travel-sample` where id = 10;

You can see the spans in the `IndexScan2` section of the Explain for the query:

NOTE: The above codeblock shows the entire EXPLAIN plan, but the below examples will show only the "spans" section.

In N1QL, Index Scan requests are based on a range where each range has a start value, an end value, and specifies whether to include the start or the end value.

[#ul_uh1_bjk_jbb]
* A "High" field in the range indicates the end value.
If "High" is missing, then there is no upper bound.
* A "Low" field in the range indicates the start value.
If "Low" is missing, the scan starts with `MISSING`.
* Inclusion indicates if the values of the High and Low fields are included.

Observe that the optimizer created the span without the `id < 25` predicate because the AND predicate `+id <=20+` makes the former predicate redundant.
Internally, the optimizer breaks down each predicate and then combines it in a logically consistent manner.
FYI: If this is too detailed for now, you can skip over to Example 8.

[#table_dgm_lky_mx,cols="2,1,1,1"]

| `20`
| `2 (HIGH)`

| `+id >= 10 AND id < 25 AND id <= 20+`
| `10`
| `20`
| `3 (BOTH)`
|===

Internally, the following steps occur:

[#ul_xkc_vky_mx]
. Combined Low becomes highest of both Low values (NULL is the lowest.)
. Combined High becomes lowest of both High values (Unbounded is the highest.)
. Combined Inclusion becomes OR of corresponding inclusions of Step 1 and Step 2.
. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for each AND clause.

This is a special case where the span is Low: 10, High: 5, and Inclusion: 0.
In this case, the start value is higher than the end value and will not produce results; so, the span is converted to EMPTY SPAN, which will not do any IndexScan.

In this example, the predicate is `id IN [10,20]` (that is, id = 10 OR id = 20).
After eliminating the duplicates, each element is pushed as a separate range to index scan.

NOTE: In version 4.5, up to 8192 IN elements are pushed as separate ranges to the index service.
If the number of elements exceed 8192, then the index service performs a full scan on that key.

----

The span indicates that the index service is performing a complete index scan.
If the index does not cover the query, the query service fetches the document from the data node and then applies the predicate.
For better performance, create a new index as follows:

----
CREATE INDEX `idx_absid` ON `travel-sample`(abs(`id`));
----

When index `idx_absid` is used, the predicate `abs(id) = 10` is pushed to index scan.

[#section_xf2_rnp_jbb]
== Summary

When you analyze the explain plan, correlate the predicates in the explain to the spans.
Ensure the most optimal index is selected and the spans have the expected range for all the index keys.
More keys in each span will make the query more efficient.
