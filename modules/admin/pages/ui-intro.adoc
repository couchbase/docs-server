= Couchbase Web Console

[abstract]
The Couchbase Web Console is the main tool for managing the Couchbase environment.

The interface for Couchbase Server’s Web Console offers a new, modern look on usability in a browser-based application.
Re-designed for intelligence, comfort, and speed, you will see a clean new look and experience a streamlined interface to Couchbase’s administration and development platform that optimizes your common tasks and workflows.

Some of the more obvious improvements are the modern color palette that shows the condition of your cluster, servers, and services; simplified navigation that lets you know where you are, where you’ve been, and where you might go next; and a responsive layout that fits your browser at any screen size.

When you start the Couchbase Web Console, by default the introductory [.uicontrol]*Dashboard* page is displayed.

The *Dashboard* screen contains three sections: Services, Data Services, and Buckets.

== Services

The [.uicontrol]*Services* section indicates all running services for the cluster.

.Services Details
[#table_services,cols="3,8"]
|===
| Field | Description

| Data Service
| The number of data nodes that have Data Service running.

| Index Service
| The number of data nodes that have the Indexe Service running.

| FTS Service
| The number of data nodes that have the Full Text Search (FTS) Service running.

| Query Service
| The number of data nodes that have the Query Service running.

| Eventing Service
| The number of data nodes that have the Eventing Service running.

| Analytics Service
| The number of data nodes that have the Analytics Service running.

| XDCR
| The number of remote clusters and replications on this cluster.

== Data Services

The [.uicontrol]*Data Services* section provides information on the memory and disk usage information of your cluster.

.Clusters Details
[#table_cluster,cols="3,8"]
|===
| Field | Description

2+| *Data Service Memory* section provides a graphical representation of your RAM situation.

| total quota
| The amount of RAM allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

| unallocated
| The amount of RAM not allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

| unused
| The amount of memory that is unused (available) for storing data.

| in use
| The amount of memory across all buckets that is actually in use (that is data is actively being stored).

2+| *Data Service Disk* section provides similar summary information for disk storage space across your cluster.

| usable free space
| The amount of usable space for storing information on disk.
This figure shows the amount of space available on the configured path after non-Couchbase files have been taken into account.

| free
| The free space available for storing objects on disk.

| other data
| The quantity of disk space in use by data other than Couchbase information.

For memory, it is comprised of the memory consumed by all other Couchbase Server processes (`beam.smp`, memcached, etc.), other processes, and that used by the operating system for disk cache.

| in use
| The amount of disk space being used to store actively information on disk.
|===

== Buckets

The [.uicontrol]*Buckets* section provides the following two graphs:

.Buckets Details
[#table_buckets,cols="3,8"]
|===
| Graph Name | Description

| Operations Per Second
| Provides information on the level of activity on the cluster in terms of storing or retrieving objects from the data store.

| Disk Fetches Per Second
| Indicates how frequently Couchbase Server is reaching to disk to retrieve information instead of using the information stored in RAM.
