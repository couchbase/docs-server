= Couchbase Web Console

[abstract]
The Couchbase Web Console is the main tool for managing the Couchbase environment.

The Couchbase Web Console is accessed by navigating to `+http://<host>:8091/+` in a web browser, where `<host>` is the IP address or hostname of a node running Couchbase Server.

When you start the Couchbase Web Console, the introductory screen opens with the tab [.ui]*Cluster Overview* selected by default.

The Cluster Overview screen contains three sections: Cluster, Buckets, and Servers.

== Cluster

The [.ui]*Cluster* section provides information on the RAM and disk usage information for your cluster.

For the RAM information, you are provided with a graphical representation of your RAM situation, including:

* `Total in Cluster`

Total RAM or the total amount of memory configured for all the servers within the cluster.

* `Total Allocated`

The amount of RAM allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

* `Unallocated`

The amount of RAM not allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

* `In Use`

The amount of memory across all buckets that is actually in use (that is data is actively being stored).

* `Unused`

The amount of memory that is unused (available) for storing data.

The `Disk Overview` section provides similar summary information for disk storage space across your cluster.

* `Total Cluster Storage`

The total amount of disk storage available across your entire cluster for storing data.

* `Usable Free Space`

The amount of usable space for storing information on disk.
This figure shows the amount of space available on the configured path after non-Couchbase files have been taken into account.

* `Other Data`

The quantity of disk space in use by data other than Couchbase information.

For memory, it is comprised of the memory consumed by all other Couchbase Server processes (`beam.smp`, memcached, etc.), other processes, and that used by the operating system for disk cache.

* `In Use`

The amount of disk space being used to store actively information on disk.

* `Free`

The free space available for storing objects on disk.

== Buckets

The [.ui]*Buckets* section provides two graphs showing the `Operations per second` and `Disk fetches per second`.

The `Operations per second` provides information on the level of activity on the cluster in terms of storing or retrieving objects from the data store.

The `Disk fetches per second` indicate how frequently Couchbase Server is reaching to disk to retrieve information instead of using the information stored in RAM.

For more details, see xref:clustersetup:bucket-setup.adoc[Bucket setup].

== Servers

The [.ui]*Servers* section indicates overall server information for the cluster:

image::ui-servers.png[,720,align=left]

Active Servers:: The number of active servers within the current cluster configuration.

Servers Failed Over:: The number of servers that have failed over due to an issue that should be investigated.

Servers Down:: The number of servers that are down and cannot be contacted.

Servers Pending Rebalance:: The number of servers that are currently waiting to be rebalanced after joining a cluster or being reactivated after failover.

For more details, see xref:clustersetup:server-setup.adoc[Server setup].
