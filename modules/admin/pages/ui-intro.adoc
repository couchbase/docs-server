= Couchbase Web Console

[abstract]
The Couchbase Web Console is the main tool for managing the Couchbase environment.

The Couchbase Web Console is accessed by navigating to `http://<host>:8091/` in a web browser, where `<host>` is the IP address or hostname of a node running Couchbase Server.

When you start the Couchbase Web Console, the introductory screen opens with the tab [.uicontrol]*Cluster Overview* selected by default.

The *Cluster Overview* screen contains three sections: Cluster, Buckets, and Servers.

== Cluster

The [.uicontrol]*Cluster* section provides information on the RAM and disk usage information for your cluster.

[#table_qtx_1pj_yx,cols="1,3"]
|===
| Option | Description

2+| *RAM Overview*

| Total in Cluster
| The total RAM or the total amount of memory configured for all the servers within the cluster.

| Total Allocated
| The amount of RAM allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

| Unallocated
| The amount of RAM not allocated to data buckets within your cluster.

| Unused
| The amount of memory that is unused (available) for storing data.

| In Use
| The amount of memory across all buckets that is actually in use (that is data is actively being stored).

2+| *Disk Overview*

| Total Cluster Storage
| The total amount of disk storage available across your entire cluster for storing data.

| Usable Free Space
| The amount of usable space for storing information on disk.
This figure shows the amount of space available on the configured path after non-Couchbase files have been taken into account.

| Free
| The free space available for storing objects on disk.

| Other Data
| The quantity of disk space in use by data other than Couchbase information.

For memory, it is comprised of the memory consumed by all other Couchbase Server processes (`beam.smp`, memcached, etc.), other processes, and that used by the operating system for disk cache.

| In Use
| The amount of disk space being used to store actively information on disk.

== Buckets

The *Buckets* section displays two graphs:

[#table_jt1_frj_yx]
|===
| Graph Name | Description

| Operations per second
| Provides information on the level of activity on the cluster in terms of storing or retrieving objects from the data store.

| Disk fetches per second
| Indicates how frequently Couchbase Server is reaching to disk to retrieve information instead of using the information stored in RAM.

== Servers

The *Servers* section indicates overall server information for the cluster:

[#table_pcj_vrj_yx]
|===
| Field | Description

| Active Servers
| The number of active servers within the current cluster configuration.

| Servers Failed Over
| The number of servers that have failed over due to an issue that should be investigated.

| Servers Down
| The number of servers that are down and cannot be contacted.

| Servers Pending Rebalance
| The number of servers that are currently waiting to be rebalanced after joining a cluster or being reactivated after failover.
