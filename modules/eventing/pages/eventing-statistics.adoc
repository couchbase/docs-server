= Statistics
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
Eventing Statistics, for each deployed Function, can be fetched from an Eventing node using the Web Console or using the REST API.

As of 6.6.0, Eventing Statistics can be displayed in the Eventing main UI page for each deployed Function by clicking on the Function name to expand the Function controls. These four key metrics or Deployment Statistics are displayed as numeric values:

* *success*	- displays the number of processed Functions.	   
* *failure*	- displays the number of failures while processing the Function handler code.
* *backlog*	- displays the number of mutations to be processed by a Function.
* *timeout*	- displays the number of Functions which have encountered a timeout condition.

In addition per Function Statistics can be fetched the Web Console or using the REST API.

*Via the Web Console*

Eventing Statistics, for each deployed Function, can be fetched from an Eventing node using the Web Console.

Prior to the 6.6.0 release, to fetch Eventing Statistics for a deployed Function you need to leave the Eventing main UI page. First go to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Servers* page, then click *Statistics*. Note that this page will only show deployed Eventing functions. You can scroll down to any section labeled *Eventing Stats: _deployed_function_name_* and expand the section to show the four key graphs for the Function, along with numeric values listed below each graph:

* *Processed* - displays the number of processed Functions.
* *Failures* - displays the number of failures while processing the Function handler code.
* *Backlogs* - displays the number of mutations to be processed by a Function.
* *Timeouts* - displays the number of Functions which have encountered a timeout condition.

Note, you may click and expand any of the above graphs for any deployed Eventing Function.

*Via the REST API*

NOTE: The Functions REST API endpoints on this page are supported, as long as the content of the handler body is not created or modified externally (as the internal format of the body is not yet standardized).

Eventing statistics can be fetched from each eventing node using REST API bound to localhost. The resulting
JSON based responses are local to the node, and suitable for further aggregation across nodes of the cluster.

The following REST endpoint could be used to get the full set of Eventing statistics:
```shell
curl http://user:pass@localhost:8096/api/v1/stats?type=full
```
This will return the full statistics set inclusive of events processing, events remaining, execution, failure, latency, worker PIDs and sequence processed.

Note, omitting the parameter `type=full` will exclude `dcp_event_backlog_per_vb`, `doc_timer_debug_stats`, `latency_stats`, `plasma_stats` and `seqs_processed` from the response.

The above statistics can also be individually obtained through the following REST endpoints:
```shell
curl http://user:pass@localhost:8096/getExecutionStats?name=function_name
curl http://user:pass@localhost:8096/getLatencyStats?name=function_name
curl http://user:pass@localhost:8096/getFailureStats?name=function_name
```
