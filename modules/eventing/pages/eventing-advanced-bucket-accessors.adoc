= Advanced Bucket Accessors
:description: pass:q[The _Advanced Bucket Accessors_ make it possible to access advanced KV functionality using the following built-in operators.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition 

{description}
They utilize the same bucket bindings defined in the handler as the _Basic Bucket Accessors_, but expose a richer set of options and operators that can be used to 1) set or retrieve expirations, 2) solve race conditions via CAS and 3) manipulate hot KV items under high contention.

NOTE: The xref:eventing-language-constructs.adoc#bucket_accessors[Basic Bucket Accessors] are much easier to use, having a trivial API, and are also a bit faster than the corresponding Advanced Bucket Accessors.

//****
[.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.1# 
The following Advanced Bucket Accessors have been added:

* <<advanced-get-op,The Advanced GET operation>> 
* <<advanced-insert-op,The Advanced INSERT operation>>
* <<advanced-upsert-op,The Advanced UPSERT operation>>
* <<advanced-replace-op,The Advanced REPLACE operation>>
* <<advanced-delete-op,The Advanced DELETE operation>>
* <<advanced-increment-op,The Advanced INCREMENT operation>>
* <<advanced-decrement-op,The Advanced DECREMENT operation>>

These seven (7) new Bucket Accessors make it possible to utilize and leverage CAS directly and/or set a document expiration (or TTL) in the Data Service (or KV) via Eventing plus perform distributed atomic counter operations.  

For complete examples including JavaScript, input mutations, output mutations and/or log messages for each Advanced Bucket Accessor refer to 
xref:eventing-examples.adoc#examples-scriptlets-advanced-accessors[Scriptlets: Advanced Accessor Handlers] in the examples section of the documentation.

[#advanced-get-op]
*The Advanced GET operation*: _result = couchbase.get(binding, meta)_

This operation allows reading a document along with metadata from the bucket this allows subsequent operations to utilize CAS or check/modify the expiry_date.

Contrast this to the _Basic Bucket Accessor GET operation_ which merely exposes a JavaScript binding or map, "_var adoc = src_bkt[meta.id]_",
where the return value is just the document without any metadata.

Below is an example of the _Advanced GET operation_.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input doc ', doc);
    log('input meta', meta);
    // could be the same or different
    var new_meta = {"id":"test_adv_get::1"};
    var result = couchbase.get(src_bkt,new_meta);
    if (result.success) {
        log('success adv. get: result',result);
    } else {
        log('failure adv. get: id',new_meta.id,'result',result);
    }
}

+
The name of the binding that references the target bucket. The binding can have an access level of _"read"_ or _"read/write"_.

* _meta (type: Object)_
+
The positional parameter (denoted by _meta_ in the prototype above) represents the metadata of the operation. At a minimum, the document key must be specified in this object.

** _meta.id (type: string)_
+
The key of the document to be used for the operation. This is a mandatory parameter and must be of JavaScript _string_ type.

+
The return object indicates success/failure of the operation, and the data fetched if successful, or details of the error in case of a failure.

** _result.success (type: boolean)_
+
This field indicates if the operation was successful or not. It is always present in the return object.

** _result.meta (type: Object)_
+
This field is present only if the operation succeeded. It contains metadata about the object that was fetched. If the specified key is not present in the bucket, the operation fails and _key_not_found_ will be set in the error object.

*** _result.meta.id (type: string)_
+
The key of the document that was fetched by this operation.

*** _result.meta.cas (type: string)_
+
The CAS value of the document that was fetched by this operation.

*** _result.meta.expiry_date (type: Date)_
+
The expiration date of the document. If no expiration is set on the document, this field will be absent.

*** _result.meta.datatype (type: string)_
+
An indicator of whther the document is "json" or "binary". [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.2#

** _result.doc (type: string, number, boolean, null, Object or Array)_
+
If the operation is successful, this field contains the content of the requested document.

** _result.error (type: Object)_
+
This field is populated only if the operation failed. The content of the error varies based on the type of error encountered, and commonly occurring fields are documented below.

*** _result.error.key_not_found (type: boolean)_
+
If present and set to true, this indicates that the operation failed because the specified key did not exist in the bucket.

+
If present, represents the SDK error code that triggered this operation to fail. This is typically an internal numeric code.

*** _result.error.name (type: string)_
+
If present, the key is a token indicating the error that SDK encountered that caused this operation to fail. 

*** _result.error.desc (type: string)_
+
If present, a human readable description of the error that occurred. The description is for diagnostics and logging purposes only and may change over time. No programmatic logic should be tied to specific contents from this field.

+
This API indicates errors via the error object in the return value. Exceptions are thrown only during system failure conditions.

[#advanced-insert-op]

*The Advanced INSERT operation*: _result = couchbase.insert(binding, meta, doc)_

This operation allows creating a fresh document in the bucket. This operation will fail if the document with the specified key already exists. 
It allows specifying an expiration time (or TTL) to be set on the document. 

There is no analogous Basic Bucket Accessor operation to the _Advanced INSERT operation_ (as "_src_bkt[meta.id] = adoc_" is more like an upsert).

Below is an example of the _Advanced INSERT operation_.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input meta', meta);
    log('input doc ', doc);
    // could be the same or different
    var new_meta = {"id":"test_adv_insert:1"};
    // optional set an expiry 60 seconds in the future
    // new_meta.expiry_date = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 1000);
    var new_doc = doc;
    new_doc.random = Math.random();
    var result = couchbase.insert(src_bkt,new_meta,new_doc);
    if (result.success) {
        log('success adv. insert: result',result);
    } else {
        log('failure adv. insert: id',new_meta.id,'result',result);

[#advanced-upsert-op]

*The Advanced UPSERT operation*: _result = couchbase.upsert(binding, meta, doc)_

This operation allows updating an existing document in the bucket, or if absent, creating a fresh document with the specified key. 
The operation does not allow specifying CAS (it will be silently ignored).
It also allows specifying an expiration time (or TTL) to be set on the document. 

Contrast this to the _Basic Bucket Accessor SET operation_ which merely uses an exposed a JavaScript binding or map, "_src_bkt[meta.id] = adoc_", 
where there is no return value (no status and no metadata).

Below is an example of the _Advanced UPSERT operation_.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input meta', meta);
    log('input doc ', doc);
    // could be the same or different
    var new_meta = {"id":"test_adv_upsert:1"}; // CAS if supplied will be ignored
    // optional set an expiry 60 seconds in the future
    // new_meta.expiry_date = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 1000);
    var new_doc = doc;
    new_doc.random = Math.random();
    var result = couchbase.upsert(src_bkt,new_meta,new_doc);
    if (result.success) {

** _meta.expiry_date (type: Date)_
+
This is an optional parameter. If specified, it must be of JavaScript _Date_ object type. The document created or updated by this operation will be marked to expire at the specified time. If no _expiry_date_ is passed, and if the document had a prior expiration set, the prior expiration will be cleared.

[#advanced-replace-op]

*The Advanced REPLACE operation*: _result = couchbase.replace(binding, meta, doc)_

This operation replaces an existing document in the bucket. This operation will fail if the document with the specified key does not exist. 
This operation allows specifying a CAS value that must be matched as a pre-condition before proceeding with the operation. 
It also allows specifying an expiration time (or TTL) to be set on the document. 

There is no analogous Basic Bucket Accessor operation to the _Advanced REPLACE operation_ (as "_src_bkt[meta.id] = adoc_" is more like an upsert).

* _result – the return value (type: Object)_
+
The return object indicates success/failure of the operation, and the metadata of the operation, or the error details if failure.

** _result.success (type: boolean)_
+
This field indicates if the operation was successful or not. It is always present in the return object.

** _result.meta (type: Object)_
+
This field is present only if the operation succeeded. It contains metadata about the object that was deleted.

*** _result.meta.id (type: string)_
+
The key of the document that was deleted by this operation.

** _result.error (type: Object)_
+
This field is populated only if the operation failed. The content of the error varies based on the type of error encountered, and commonly occurring fields are documented below.

*** _result.error.error.cas_mismatch (type: boolean)_
+
If present and set to true, this indicates that the operation failed because a CAS value was specified, and the CAS value on the object did not match the requested value.

*** _result.error.key_not_found (type: boolean)_
+
If present and set to true, this indicates that the operation failed because the specified key did not exist in the bucket.

*** _result.error.code (type: number)_
+
If present, the code of the SDK error that triggered this operation to fail. This is typically an internal numeric code.

*** _result.error.name (type: string)_
+
If present, the key is a token indicating the error that SDK encountered that caused this operation to fail. 

*** _result.error.desc (type: string)_
+
If present, a human readable description of the error that occurred. The description is for diagnostics and logging purposes only and may change over time. No programmatic logic should be tied to specific contents from this field.

* _exceptions_
+
This API indicates errors via the error object in the return value. Exceptions are thrown only during system failure conditions.

[#advanced-increment-op]

*The Advanced INCREMENT operation*: _result = couchbase.incrment(binding, meta)_

This operation atomically increments the field _"count"_ in the specified document. The document must have the below structure:

[source,javascript]
----
{"count": 23} // 23 is the current counter value
----

The _increment_ operation returns the post-increment value. 

If the specified counter document does not exist, one is created with _count_ value as 0 and the structure noted above. And so, the first returned value will be 1.

Due to limitations in KV engine API, this operation cannot currently manipulate full document counters. 

There is no analogous Basic Bucket Accessor operation to the _Advanced INCREMENT operation_.

Below is an example of the _Advanced INCREMENT operation_.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input meta', meta);
    log('input doc ', doc);

    // if doc.count doesn't exist it will be created
    var ctr_meta = {"id": "my_atomic_counter:1" };
    var result = couchbase.increment(src_bkt,ctr_meta);
    if (result.success) {
        log('success adv. increment: result',result);
    } else {
        log('failure adv. increment: id',ctr_meta.id,'result',result);
    }
}
----

An example return value, assumes this exists KEY "my_atomic_counter:1" DOC {"count": 23} :

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "doc": {
        "count": 24
    },
    "meta": {
        "id": "key::1",
        "cas": "1609374571840471040"
    },
    "success": true
}
----

* _binding_
+
The name of the binding that references the target bucket. The binding must have access level of _"read/write"_.

* _meta (type: Object)_
+
The positional parameter (denoted by _meta_ in the prototype above) represents the metadata of the operation. At minimum, the document key must be specified in this object.

** _meta.id (type: string)_
+
The key of the document to be used for the operation. This is a mandatory parameter and must be of JavaScript _string_ type.

* _result – the return value (type: Object)_
+
The return object indicates success/failure of the operation, and the metadata of the operation, or the error details if failure.

** _result.success (type: boolean)_
+
This field indicates if the operation was successful or not. It is always present in the return object.

** _result.meta (type: Object)_
+
This field is present only if the operation succeeded. It contains metadata about the counter that was incremented (or created and incremented).

*** _result.meta.id (type: string)_
+
The key of the document that was incremented (or created and incremented) by this operation.

** _result.error (type: Object)_
+
This field is populated only if the operation failed. The content of the error varies based on the type of error encountered, and commonly occurring fields are documented below.
+
Note: if you will be handling large counts (more than 15 digits), please refer to xref:eventing-Terminologies.adoc#json_number_percision[JSON Number Precision].

*** _result.error.code (type: number)_
+
If present, the code of the SDK error that triggered this operation to fail. This is typically an internal numeric code.

*** _result.error.name (type: string)_
+
If present, the key is a token indicating the error that SDK encountered that caused this operation to fail. 

*** _result.error.desc (type: string)_
+
If present, a human readable description of the error that occurred. The description is for diagnostics and logging purposes only and may change over time. No programmatic logic should be tied to specific contents from this field.

[#advanced-decrement-op]

*The Advanced DECREMENT operation*: _result = couchbase.decrement(binding, meta)_

This operation atomically decrements the field _"count"_ in the specified document. The document must have the below structure:

[source,javascript]
----
{"count": 23} // 23 is the current counter value
----

The _decrement_ operation returns the post-decrement value. 

If the specified counter document does not exist, one is created with _count_ value as 0 and the structure noted above. And so, the first returned value will be -1.

Due to limitations in KV engine API, this operation cannot currently manipulate full document counters. 

There is no analogous Basic Bucket Accessor operation to the _Advanced DECREMENT operation_.

Below is an example of the _Advanced DECREMENT operation_.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input meta', meta);
    log('input doc ', doc);

    // if doc.count doesn't exist it will be created
    var ctr_meta = {"id": "my_atomic_counter:1" };
    var result = couchbase.decrement(src_bkt,ctr_meta);
    if (result.success) {
        log('success adv. decrement: result',result);
    } else {
        log('failure adv. decrement: id',ctr_meta.id,'result',result);
    }
