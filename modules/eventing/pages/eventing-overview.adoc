= Eventing Service: Fundamentals

[abstract]
The Couchbase Eventing Service is a multidimensional-scaling(MDS) enabled service that lets you process changes to data as they happen in real-time.

== Eventing Service

The Couchbase Eventing Service provides near real-time handling of changes to data.
It consists of event-oriented, programmable constructs: code can be executed both in response to document-mutations, and as scheduled by timers.

This page provides an overview of the service, describing prominent use-cases and benefits.
It also introduces the _Functions_ offering which enables you to write server-side functions that are automatically triggered using the familiar Event-Condition-Action model.
Functions let you develop and debug the code on generated mutations to the data residing in a Couchbase cluster.

== Functions

Within the Eventing Service framework, Functions handle data-changes according to an _Event-Condition-Action_ model.
This provides a highly performant, fault-tolerant development platform that is highly supportive of business-logic, and so facilitates the deployment of business-rules.

Whenever a document is created, updated, or deleted on Couchbase Server, Functions handle the event that is duly generated.
This _as a Service_ approach eradicates the need for multiple writes from the application tier; and makes polling from the middle tier unnecessary.
Architecturally, the possibility of layer consolidation is thereby increased.

The Functions offering is implemented in JavaScript.
Note that some language-constructs have been constrained; and others have been added, to enhance performance and semantics.

== Features Provided

The Eventing Service and Functions provide the following features:

* Notification before expiry
* Threshold-based monitoring and alerting
* Propagation of changes to other systems
* Enrichment of content in near real-time
* Triggering of routines on given documents at specified intervals
* Deletion-cascade

== Use Cases

A subset of important industry-specific use-cases is as follows:

* _Media and Entertainment_: News alerts, content expiration and archival, enrichment
* _Financial Technology_: Tickers, event propagation, risk modeling, trade summaries
* _Healthcare_: Monitoring vitals, A/B risk assessments
* _Telecommunications and Internet of Things_: Call monitoring and alerts, network performance, sensor monitoring
* _Travel and Hospitality_: Price alerts, special promotions
* _Law, Defense, and Security_: Transient event detection, real-time compliance
* _Retail, SCM, and Logistics_: Instant loyalty, wishlists, stock replenishments, price alerts.
* _Sports and Gaming_: leader board, bet analysis, statistics products

== Benefits

Benefits can be summarized as follows:

* Improving customer experience and engagement
 ** Near real-time processing of customer interactions
 ** Easier data-enrichment capabilities, leading to a personalized customer experience
 ** Easier identification of _needles in the haystack_, with minimized overhead
* Faster innovation and reduced time-to-market
 ** Quicker development cycles, and improved developer experience, leading to earlier _Minimum-Viable-Products_ (MVPs).
 ** Lower barrier to technology-adoption by business operations
 ** Faster response to business-change
* Reducing infrastructure and operations-cost
 ** Simpler deployment-models, with an integrated approach to infrastructure
 ** Avoidance of data-leaks, leading to better data-governance
 ** Highly performant and fault-tolerant service at scale

== Terminology

The following terms are frequently used in descriptions of Eventing.

* _Binding_: A construct that allows the separating of environment-specific variables — such as bucket-names, external endpoint URLs, and credentials — from handler source-code.
It allows functions to be developed without source changes being required to production workflows.
* _Function_: A collection of handlers (each being either `OnUpdate` or `OnDelete`), implementing a composite business-functionality.
Resources are managed at or above function level, and the state of all handlers is scoped by the containing function.
* _Handler_: A stateless, short-running code-fragment that reacts to a specified event.
One or more handlers together constitute a function.
A handler must execute from start to finish, prior to a specified timeout-duration.
`OnUpdate` or `OnDelete` are the only two handlers currently exposed.
* _Redeployment_: Functions do not have a native concept of redeployment in Couchbase Server 5.5.
However, deployment with the DCP provider option of starting with the last sequence-number processed by the prior deployment of this function is sometimes referred to as redeployment.

 ** The metadata bucket (which will eventually be a system collection)
 ** The document being observed and its Extended Attributes
 ** The storage-providers bound to the function
