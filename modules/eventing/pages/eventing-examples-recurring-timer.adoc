= Recurring Timer
:description: pass:q[Demonstrate a recurring Eventing Timer.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: {description}

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler and a Timer callback function. The handler listens for mutations or data-changes within a specified, source collection. When any document within this collection is created or modified, the Eventing Function creates a callback in the future to execute a user-defined routine. In this example, we rely on a control document which if the created or altered controls whether a Recurring Timer will be created or canceled.

** *Test 1*: The control document is created or mutated in such a way that a Timer is created and fires approximately 30 seconds in the future, at which point a document representing user work is written to the source collection with the scheduled time of execution. The original control document, in the source collection, is not changed.  The Timer is re-armed and will execute again until canceled.

** *Test 2*: The control document mutated in such a way that any existing Timer with the reference of the control documents id (meta.id) is canceled. This has no effect if the Timer created has already fired.

*Preparations*:

For this example, two (2) buckets *'bulk'* and *'rr100'* are required where the latter is intended to be 100% resident.  
Create the buckets with a minimum size of 100MB. 
For information on buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
Within the buckets we need three (2) keyspaces *'bulk.data.source'* and *'rr100.eventing.metadata'* 
(we loosely follow this xref:eventing-buckets-to-collections.adoc#single-tenancy[organization]).

For the Function Scope or RBAC grouping we will use the *'bulk.data'* assuming you have the role of either "Full Admin" or "Eventing Full Admin". For standard or non-privileged users refer to xref:eventing-rbac.adoc[Eventing Role-Based Access Control].

_If you run a version of Couchbase prior to 7.0 you can just create the buckets *'source'* and *'metadata'* and run this example.  Furthermore if your cluster was subsequently upgraded from say 6.6.2 to 7.0 your data would be moved to *'source._default._default'* and *'metadata._default._default'* and your Eventing Function would be seamlessly upgraded to use the new keyspaces and continue to run correctly._

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For complete details on how to set up your keyspaces refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[creating buckets] and 
xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[creating scopes and collections].  

NOTE: The Eventing Storage keyspace, in this case *'rr100.eventing.metadata'*, is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from it.  In addition do not drop or flush or delete the containing bucket (or delete this collection) while you have any deployed Eventing functions. In a single tenancy deployment this collection can be shared with other Eventing functions.

*Setup*:

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
** You should see the following once you have created your buckets:
+
image::recurring_timer_01_buckets.png[,100%]

. [Optional Step] Verify we have our empty collections:
** Click the *Scopes & Collections* link of the *bulk* bucket (on the right).
** Click the *data* scope name to expand the section (on the left).
** You should see no user records.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_data_in_scope.png[,100%]
+
. Click the *Documents* link of the *source* collection (on the right).
** Again you should see no user records.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_documents.png[,800]
+
** Click *Add Document* in the upper right banner
** For the *ID* in the *Create New Document* dialog specify *recurring_timer::1*
+
----
ID [ recurring_timer::1       ]
----
+
** For the document body in the *Create New Document* dialog, the following text is displayed:
+
----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** replace the above text with the following JSON document via a cut-n-paste
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}
----
+
image::recurring_timer_01_docdata.png[,484]
+
** Click *Save*.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Function Scope* drop-down, select *'bulk.data'* as the RBAC grouping.
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-down, select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the keyspace.
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-down, select *rr100*, *eventing*, *metadata* as the keyspace.
 ** Enter *recurring_timer* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** Leave the "Deployment Feed Boundary" as Everything.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Explore recurring timers*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add just one binding.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src_col* as the "alias name" of the collection, 
 select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the associated keyspace, and select "read and write" for the access mode.
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::recurring_timer_01_settings.png[,484]

. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *recurring_timer* dialog appears.
** The *recurring_timer* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *recurring_timer* code in this block.
+
image::recurring_timer_02_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *recurring_timer* dialog.

[source,javascript]

function CreateRecurringTimer(context) {
    log('From CreateRecurringTimer: creating timer', context.mode, context.id);
    // Create a timestamp 30 seconds from now
    var thirtySecFromNow = new Date(); // Get current time & add 30 sec. to it.
    thirtySecFromNow.setSeconds(thirtySecFromNow.getSeconds() + 30);
    // Create a document to use as out for our context
    createTimer(RecurringTimerCallback, thirtySecFromNow, context.id, context);
}

function RecurringTimerCallback(context) {
    log('From RecurringTimerCallback: timer fired', context);
    // rearm the timer ASAP, to ensure timer keeps running in the event
    // of later  errors or script timeouts in later "recurring work".
    CreateRecurringTimer({ "id": context.id, "mode": "via_callback" });
    // do any sort of recurring work here, just update a date_stamp in a doc
    src_col["cur_" + context.id] = { "last_update": new Date() };
}

function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // You would typically filter to mutations of interest 
    if (doc.type !== 'recurring_timer') return;
    if (doc.active === false) {
        if (cancelTimer(RecurringTimerCallback, meta.id)) {
            log('From OnUpdate: canceled active Timer, doc.active', 
                doc.active, meta.id);
        } else {
            log('From OnUpdate: no active Timer to cancel, doc.active', 
                doc.active, meta.id);
        }
    } else {
        log('From OnUpdate: create/overwrite doc.active', doc.active, meta.id);
        CreateRecurringTimer({  "id": meta.id, "mode": "via_onupdate" });
    }
}

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:

image::recurring_timer_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save and Return*.

. The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the "source" collection, actions will be processed according to the field within the document.  First we ignore all documents that do not have a doc.type of "recurring_timer" -- this is the control document.  Next we use the field "active" to determine which action we take.  

* If "active" is true we will create a series of Timers that will fire approximately 30 seconds in the future.
* If "active" is false we will cancel the existing Timer if any.
* In the event a Timer created by this Function fires, the callback *RecurringTimerCallback* executes, and will write a new document with a similar key (but with "cur_" prepended) into the "source" collection.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *recurring_timer* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.
+
image::recuring_timer_03a_deploy.png[,100%]
+
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents, and more importantly it will also run on subsequent mutations.

== Test 1: Create a Recurring Timer and allow the Timer to Fire and Rearm

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`
** Edit the control document *recurring_timer::1* -- it should look like this:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}
----
+
Change "active" to true, then click *Save*.  This will create a mutation and the Function will generate the first of a series of recurring Timers.  The control document is now:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": true
}
----

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and if necessary select the Function *recurring_timer*, then click the "Log" link for Deployed Function to view the activity.  
** Here we see from the Application log that we created a timer. Note the log is in reverse order and the bottom (or first) message was a NOOP because doc.active was false when we first deployed and we tried to cancel any timer if it was running.

. Close the Function Log dialog again. Then, to check the results of the callback, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`
** Edit the new output status document *cur_recurring_timer::1* (note the last_update field is in UTC) and you will see the data written by the Timer's callback:
+
----
{
  "last_update": "2021-07-18T17:56:10.707Z"
}
----
** Click *Cancel* to close the editor.

. Wait about 30 seconds and repeat the above. The emulated "work" of this Eventing function is merely writing a time stamp to the *cur_recurring_timer::1* document about every 30 seconds.

== Test 2: Cancel the Recurring Timer

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`
** Edit the control document *recurring_timer::1* -- it should look like this:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": true
}
----
+
Change "a_number" to 2 to create a mutation, then click *Save*.  The control document is now:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}
----

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and if necessary select the Function *recurring_timer*, then click the "Log" link for the Deployed Function to view the activity.  
** Here we see from the Application log that we canceled the sequence -- the recurring timer has stopped.
+
----
2021-07-18T10:57:59.480-07:00 [INFO] "From OnUpdate: canceled active Timer, doc.active" false "recurring_timer::1" 
----

*Cleanup*:

Go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *cancel_overwrite_timer*, this will remove the 1280 documents (2048 prior to 7.0.0) for the function from the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' collection (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' keyspace if there are no deployed Eventing Functions.

Now flush the 'bulk' bucket if you plan to run other examples (you may need to Edit the bucket 'bulk' and enable the flush capability).
