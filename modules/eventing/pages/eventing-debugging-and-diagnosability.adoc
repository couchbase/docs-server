= Debugging and Diagnosability
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
Debugging and diagnostics in the Eventing Service comprises of debugging functions, functions log, and log redaction.


[#debugging-functions]
== Debugging Functions

Couchbase Server, for its Eventing Service framework, includes a powerful full function online real-time Javascript Debugger.
Debug is a special flag on a Function.
The Debug option integrates seamlessly with the Google Chrome Debugger engine for running the Javascript code of any handler.

Port *9140* is the default Eventing debug port. To change the default port settings, see xref:eventing-debugging-and-diagnosability.adoc#modifydebugport[Modifying the Debug Port].

=== Debugging Workflow

* During a debug session, a single mutation received by the Function is considered and sent to the Debugger.
This technique ensures that processing of the other data mutations in the cluster does not get blocked.
* The Worker in the Debugger pauses to trap the next event-instance, opens an ephemeral TCP port, and generates a Chrome dev-tools URL, with a session cookie that controls the debug worker.
* All other events are unaffected except the trapped event-instance.
* Using the Debug option, you can place breakpoints in the code and run the Function execution, one line at a time.
The step-step execution helps while troubleshooting the deployed Function.
* If the debugged event-instance completes execution, no further event-instance gets trapped for debugging.
* If a debug session gets terminated during execution, then the mutation may be abruptly processed.
* Debugging is a convenience-feature intended to help during Function development: it is highly discouraged for use in production environments.

WARNING: Debug mode should be avoided in production environments, as it affects the in-order processing of the document mutations as well as introducing timing related issues.

=== Debugging a Function Using the Debug Option

. To enable debugging, navigate to *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, from the top banner, click *Settings* and check the *Enable Debugger* option. This setting change is needed to enable the *Debug* button in the *Edit Function* page used in a step 3 below.
. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click on the name of a deployed Function.
The deployed Function expands to provide additional options.
Click *Edit JavaScript*.

. From the *Edit Function* page, click *Debug*.
A debug session gets activated.
As a result, the next event-instance gets trapped and is forwarded to the Debugger.
+
In the below screen, you can notice the message: "Waiting for mutation."

NOTE: During a debugging session this window must remain active. When you are presented a debug URL you must copy then paste it into a new browser window (described below). If you are using the UI to create the mutation, you must use a different browser window to create the mutation.

[start=4]
. Upon a data mutation, the debug URL in the Debugging pop-up gets populated and the *Copy* button is enabled.
+

. Click *Copy* in the pop-up.

. Paste the URL from the Debugging pop-up that you copied into a new window (or tab) in your Google Chrome browser's address bar.
+

. From your Google Chrome browser, you can add breakpoints and run step-step diagnosis to debug and troubleshoot the deployed Function.
. From the Debugging pop-up, click *Stop Debugging* to terminate a debug session.
+
The URL you copied is valid only for a single mutation, to debug another subsequent mutation you must click *Stop debugging* button and repeat from Step 3. above.

=== Transpiler and Source Map

A transpiler accepts source code provided as input from one high-level programming language and produces an equivalent code in another high-level programming language.

Couchbase Server uses a native transpiler. This transpiler converts the handler syntax into a pure JavaScript representation that the JavaScript engine can understand. If this transpiler was unavailable, then the JavaScript engine would have failed to compile any native N1QL queries or curl() functions.

When your source code is transformed, debugging becomes a problem because we must know where the original code is. Source maps solve this problem by providing a mapping between the original and the transformed source code.

A source map, generated by our native transpiler provides a mapping between the transpiled code and the original function handler code. Debugging is easy as the debugger detects the source map and presents the code to the developer in the original handler format.

Upon source map detection, a text confirmation flag gets displayed in the bottom of your browser's debug window as a very long comment an example is highlighted below:

[.out]`//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJzb3VyY2VzIjpb` *truncated*

[#modifydebugport]
=== Modifying the Debug Port

By default, the *ns_server* configures the Eventing Debug on port *9140*. Using the *static_config* file you can modify the default Eventing Debug port.

To modify the debug port:

        . Stop Couchbase server.
        . Navigate to the */opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config* file. This is the location where Couchbase Server picks up the configuration parameters.
        . Edit the *static_config file* to add the new eventing_debug_port and the new port-number information.
        . (Optional step) To remove any old configuration file, delete the */opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat* file.
        . Start Couchbase server.

*Note*: If no port numbers are not specified, default ports are used. To override some or all default ports, append the user-defined ports to the *static_config file* file.

[#logging-functions]
== Logging Functions

The Eventing Service creates two different types of logs:

* System Logs
* Application Logs

The available logging levels are: _Info, Error, Warning, Debug, and Trace (Info is the default)_.
The level can be altered via the "System Log Level" choice in the Settings dialog of each individual Eventing function and impacts information sent to both the System Log and the specific Function's Application Log.

image::debug_5_log_level.png[,484]

=== System Logs

For the Eventing Service, Couchbase Server creates a separate system log file named eventing.log which is by default located at */opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/eventing.log*.
The system log file captures all the Eventing Service related system errors depending on the level and severity of the reported problem.
For every node, a single system log file gets created.



The *eventing.log* contains redactable user data and the log is collected using the *cbcollect_info* tool.
For log rotation, refer to xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc#log-file-rotation[Log File Rotation].

=== Application Logs

Application logs allow you to identify and capture various Function related activities and errors.

All Function-related activities such as editing the handler code, debugging, or modifying feed boundaries conditions, get recorded in the Application logs.
Couchbase Server creates an individual log file for every Function in the cluster.
By default, the maximum size of an Application log file is 40MB, and the number of log files before rotation is 10.
Unlike system logs, the Application logs are user-configurable.
You can access an Application log file using the command line interface.
Couchbase Server creates different application log files depending on the level and severity of the reported problem, as configured during Function definition.

NOTE: The *cbcollect_info* tool does not collect the Application log files.

.Application Logs Path in Platform
[cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Platform | Location

| Linux
| /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/@eventing

| Windows
| C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\data\@eventing +
(Assumes default installation location)

| Mac OS X
| /Users/<user>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/ couchbase/data/@eventing
|===


NOTE: During Cluster setup, if you have chosen a custom path, then the path for Application logs is same as that of the selected Indexes Path. The @eventing folder in the selected Indexes Path stores the Application logs.

To configure an Application log, use the REST endpoint settings option.  Note you must always specify deployment_status (deployed/undeployed) and processing_status (paused/not-paused) when using this REST endpoint.

*Sample URL*: `192.168.1.5:8091/_p/event/api/v1/functions/<Function_name>/settings`

*Sample Payload*:

----
{
  "settings":
    {
      "deployment_status":false,
      "processing_status":false,
      "app_log_max_files": 10,
      "app_log_max_size": 10485760
    }
  }
----

The sample payload above illustrates that the system stores 10 application log files and each file records about 10 MB of data.

At some point in time, old application log files that are no longer necessary need to be deleted to make way for new log records.
When an Application log file reaches the set limit, a new log file gets created.
All the recorded information from the active log file gets transferred to this newly created file.

For illustration, consider *case_1_enrich_ips* from the example xref:eventing-example-data-enrichment[Data Enrichment] as the name of the Function.
A corresponding Application log file, *case_1_enrich_ips.log*, gets created in the Couchbase cluster.
Whenever the *case_1_enrich_ips.log* reaches 10MB in size, assuming the maximum size of an Application log file is 10MB and the number of log files before rotation is 10, the system automatically generates the *case_1_enrich_ips.log.1* file, during its first iteration.
The file *case_1_enrich_ips.log* transfers all the log information to this new log file.
For this illustration, since the number of log files is 10, the system stores 10 such files, the currently active log file along with 9 truncated files, at any given instance.


[#log-redaction]
== Log Redaction

You can use logs for multiple purposes ranging from security, monitoring, and diagnostics.
Suppression of sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII), hostnames, internal asset information, credit card details, during the logging operation is termed as log redaction.
Organizations implement log redaction as part of their legal compliance and security risk mitigations.


Couchbase Server provides a capability to redact sensitive user data from getting captured in the logs.
All sensitive data are scrubbed and gets removed from the log files.
Post redaction, log files can be shared for troubleshooting without disregarding any regulatory compliance.

NOTE: Log redaction is applicable only for System logs and not for Application logs.

For details, see xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc#understanding_redaction[Understanding Redaction].
