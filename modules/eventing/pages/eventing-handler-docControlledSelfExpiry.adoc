= Function: Document Controlled Expiry 
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: Purge a document automatically based on self-contained start and duration fields.

* This function *docControlledSelfExpiry* demonstrates self-expiry of a document for example a user trial.
* Requires a metadata bucket and a source bucket.
* The source bucket must be named "source" and the Function needs a bucket alias of "src_bkt" in mode read+write.
* When documents are created, they will have no expiration value. This function processes the initial mutation to calculate and set the proper TTL.
* In Couchbase, when using a simple integer expiry value (as opposed to a proper date or time object), the expiration can be specified in two ways:
** As an offset from the current time. If the absolute value of the expiry is less than 30 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 seconds), it is considered an offset.
** As an absolute Unix time stamp. If the value is greater than 30 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 seconds), it is considered an absolute time stamp.
* Will operate on any document with type == "trial_customers".
* Will ignore any doc with a non-zero TTL (prevents infinite recursion)
* Uses the _N1QL(...)_ function to update the source bucket instead of an inline N1QL statement because inline N1QL is prohibited from updating the source bucket of an Eventing handler to prevent infinite recursion scenarios.
* The recursion from the N1QL(...) statement is ignored via the _if (meta.expiration !== 0) { ... }_ filter.
* This is different than setting a TTL on a bucket which will typically update (or extend) the TTL of a document on each mutation.


WARNING: You must use the function _N1QL(...)_ with great caution when updating the source bucket of your Eventing handler as you can easily create infinite  recursion which may crash your server.

// NOTE: Starting with Couchbase Server 6.6.1, you can completely avoid _N1QL(...)_ and use the call to _couchbase.replace(bucket_binding, meta, doc)_ instead 
// this will have much greater performance.

We want to create a test set of four (4) documents, use the Query Editor to insert the the data items (you do not need an index).

Note, if the today is past 2020-09-24 just change the `trialStartDate` for the last two records to at least 90 days from now.

[source,n1ql]
----
  INSERT INTO `source` (KEY,VALUE)
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::0", {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 0,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2019",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::1",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 1,
    "trialStartDate": "01-27-2020",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::2",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 2,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2020",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::3",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 3,
    "trialStartDate": "08-26-2020",
    "trialDurationDays": 60,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::2

{
  "id": 2,
  "note": "this will get an exiration set",
  "trialDurationDays": 30,
  "trialStartDate": "08-25-2020",
  "type": "trial_customers"

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::3

  "trialDurationDays": 60,
  "trialStartDate": "08-26-2020",
  "type": "trial_customers"
}

We end up with two (2) of the four documents (obviously you may need to adjust the N1QL INSERT in a few months as all the document would be immediately deleted).

* "trial_customers::0" was deleted 
* "trial_customers::1" was deleted 
* "trial_customers::2" has an meta.expiration set for 1600930800 (or 2020-09-24 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata 
* "trial_customers::3" has an meta.expiration set for 1603609200 (or 2020-10-25 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata
