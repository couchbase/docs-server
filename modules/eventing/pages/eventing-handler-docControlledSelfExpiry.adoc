= Function: Document Controlled Expiry
:description: pass:q[Purge a document automatically based on self-contained start and duration fields.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: {description}

* This function *docControlledSelfExpiry* demonstrates self-expiry of a document for example a user trial.
* Requires Eventing Storage (or metadata collection) and a "source" collection.
* Needs a Binding of type "bucket alias" (as documented in the Scriptlet).
* When documents are created, they will have no expiration value. This function processes the initial mutation to calculate and set the proper TTL.
* In Couchbase, when using a simple integer expiry value (as opposed to a proper date or time object), the expiration can be specified in two ways:
** As an offset from the current time. If the absolute value of the expiry is less than 30 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 seconds), it is considered an offset.
** As an absolute Unix time stamp. If the value is greater than 30 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 30 seconds), it is considered an absolute time stamp.
** As described in xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration], if a "Bucket Max Time-To-Live" is set (specified in seconds), it is an enforced hard upper limit. As such, any subsequent document mutation (by {sqlpp}, Eventing, or any Couchbase SDK) will result in the document having its expiration adjusted and set to the bucketâ€™s maximum TTL if the operation has:
*** No TTL.
*** A TTL of zero.
*** A TTL greater than the bucket TTL.
* Will operate on any document with type == "trial_customers".
* Will ignore any doc with a non-zero TTL (prevents infinite recursion)
* Uses the _N1QL(...)_ function to update the source bucket instead of an inline {sqlpp} statement because inline {sqlpp} is prohibited from updating the source bucket of an Eventing handler to prevent infinite recursion scenarios.
* The recursion from the N1QL(...) statement is ignored via the _if (meta.expiration !== 0) { ... }_ filter.
* This is different than setting a TTL on a bucket which will typically update (or extend) the TTL of a document on each mutation.

WARNING: You must use the function _N1QL(...)_ with great caution when updating the source bucket of your Eventing handler as you can easily create infinite  recursion which may crash your server.

// NOTE: Starting with Couchbase Server 6.6.1, you can completely avoid _N1QL(...)_ and use the call to _couchbase.replace(bucket_binding, meta, doc)_ instead
// this will have much greater performance.

Two variants of this function are available: a 6.6 version (*this Function*) that relies on {sqlpp}, and a 6.6.1 version that directly sets the expiration.
Using _N1QL(...)_ is much slower than using _couchbase.replace(bucket_binding, meta, doc)_ in the advancedDocControlledSelfExpiry variant.

We want to create a test set of four (4) documents, use the Query Editor to insert the the data items (you do not need an index).

Note, if the today is past 08-25-2021 (MM-DD-YYYY) just change the `trialStartDate` for the last two records to at least 90 days from now.

[source,sqlpp]
----
  INSERT INTO `bulk`.`data`.`source` (KEY,VALUE)
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::0", {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 0,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2019",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::1",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 1,
    "trialStartDate": "01-27-2020",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::2",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 2,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2021",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::3",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 3,
    "trialStartDate": "08-26-2021",
    "trialDurationDays": 60,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::2

{
  "id": 2,
  "note": "this will get an exiration set",
  "trialDurationDays": 30,
  "trialStartDate": "08-25-2021",
  "type": "trial_customers"
}

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::3

{
  "id": 3,
  "note": "this will get an exiration set",
  "trialDurationDays": 60,
  "trialStartDate": "08-26-2021",
  "type": "trial_customers"
}

We end up with two (2) of the four documents (obviously you may need to adjust the N1QL INSERT in a few months as all the document would be immediately deleted).

* "trial_customers::0" was deleted
* "trial_customers::1" was deleted
* "trial_customers::2" has an meta.expiration set for 1632466800 (or 2021-09-24 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata
* "trial_customers::3" has an meta.expiration set for 1635145200 (or 2021-10-25 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata
