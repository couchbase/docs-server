[#example-1]

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage the Eventing Service to perform a cascade delete operation.
When a user is deleted, Couchbase Functions provide a reliable method to delete all the associated documents with the deleted user.

This example requires you to create three buckets: users, metadata and transactions buckets.

For steps to create buckets, see https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[[.underline]#Create Bucket#^].

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnDelete* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *users* source bucket.
When a user within the source bucket gets deleted, the handler executes a routine to remove the deleted user.
When the delete operation is complete, all associated documents of the delete users get removed.

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*,to add a new Function.
+

. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements, provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select the *Users* that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select the *metadata* that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *delete_orphaned_txns* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Delete Orphaned Transactions from the `transactions’ bucket when user_id is less than 10* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, specify *users* as the *name* of the bucket and specify **src**_**user** as the associated *value*.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog appears.
+
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *delete_orphaned_txns* code in this block.
+
image::addfunctions-code_exp3.png[,400]

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *delete_orphaned_txns* screen:
+
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('OnUpdate document:', meta.id);
}

function OnDelete(meta) {
    log('Document Deleted:', meta.id);
    if(meta.id < 10)
    {
       try
       {
            var this_user_id = meta.id;
            var del = delete from `transactions` where user_id = TONUMBER($this_user_id);
            del.execQuery();
            log('Deleted Orphaned Transactions for User:', this_user_id);
       }
       catch(e)
       {
           log('Exception:', e)
       }
    }
}
----
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::ondelete-functions.png[,600]
+
The *OnDelete* handler is triggered for user delete transaction.
The handler checks if the *user_id* is less than 10.
When this condition is fulfilled, then an N1QL query is triggered to delete all user related information.
The handler is then configured to record this delete operation in a Function specific application log file.
.

. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing*.
The Function *delete_orphaned_txns* is listed as a defined Function.
Currently, it is listed as *Undeployed* and *Paused*.
. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. Navigate to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page.
Before deleting a user, a snapshot of *Query Result* from the *users* bucket is displayed:
+
image::queryresults_ondelerte.png[,400]

. The *Query Results* display users with **user_id**s from 1 to 10.
. Navigate to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
Delete two users from the *Users* bucket:
 ** Select *User4* from the list and click the *delete* icon.
 ** Select *User10* from the list and click the *delete* icon.
. From the *Query Editor*, execute an N1QL query to check that all related records for the deleted users are removed from the cluster.
+
----
SELECT user_id, COUNT(1) FROM `Users` GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY user_id ASC;
----
+
image::query-results-ondelete.png[,400]

. In the *Query Results* pane notice that user_ids, *user_id4* and *user_id 10* are removed as part of the cascade user delete operation.
