= Delete v Expiry
:description: pass:q[Differentiate between a deletion or an expiration]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: {description}

*Implementation*: 

Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnDelete* handler, which runs whenever a document is deleted or expired (or mutated).
The handler merely logs whether the document was deleted or was expired from a collection.
This function accesses the 'expired' field of the second optional argument to the handler.

*Preparations*:

For this example, two (2) buckets *'bulk'* and *'rr100'* are required where the later is intended to be 100% resident.  
Create the buckets with a minimum size of 100MB. 
For information on buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
Within the buckets we need two (2) keyspaces *'bulk.data.source'* and *'rr100.eventing.metadata'* 
(we loosely follow this xref:eventing-buckets-to-collections.adoc#single-tenancy[organization]).

_If you run a version of Couchbase prior to 7.0 you can just create the buckets *'source'* and *'metadata'* and run this example.  Furthermore if your cluster was subsequently upgraded from say 6.6.2 to 7.0 your data would be moved to *'source._default._default'* and *'metadata._default._default'* and your Eventing Function would be seamlessly upgraded to use the new keyspaces and continue to run correctly._

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For complete details on how to set up your keyspaces refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[creating buckets] and 
xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[creating scopes and collections].  

NOTE: The Eventing Storage keyspace, in this case *'rr100.eventing.metadata'*, is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from it.  In addition do not drop or flush or delete the containing bucket (or delete this collection) while you have any deployed Eventing functions. In a single tenancy deployment this collection can be shared with other Eventing functions.

You will need to run _cbc_ (the command-line KV client) or alternatively an SDK python script or Java program to create or update a document in the 'source' bucket, with an expiration time of 600 seconds.

*Procedure*:

. The example requires a document to be created in the 'source' collection with a key of *SampleDocument2*, a value of *{'a_key': 'a_value'}*, and most importantly that the document's expiration (or TTL) set to 600 seconds or 10 minutes). 
+
There are several methods to make a test document with an expiration set. The easiest is most likely using N1QL.  However you can use _cbc_ or any Couchbase SDK (the command-line KV client is compiled from the C SDK).  For example you can use a Python script or a complied Java program.

N1QL UPDATE::

--
Using the Query Workbench::
[source,N1QL]
----
UPSERT INTO `bulk`.`data`.`source` (KEY, VALUE) VALUES ("SampleDocument2", {"a_key":"a_value"}, {"expiration":600});
----
Issue the above commandin the Query Workbench of the UI.

For information on setting document expiration times via N1QL, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/insert.adoc#insert-document-with-expiration[Insert a document with expiration]

The cbc binary, or KV client::
+
--
On Linux::
[source,console]
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc \
    create SampleDocument2 -V '{"a_key": "a_value"}' \
    -U couchbase://localhost/source \
    --scope=data --collection=source \
    -u Administrator -P password \
    --expiry=600 
----
on macOS
[source,console]
----
/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbc \
    create SampleDocument2 -V '{"a_key": "a_value"}' -U couchbase://localhost/source \
    --scope=data --collection=source \
    -u Administrator -P password \
    --expiry=600
----
on Windows
[source,console]
----
"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbc" ^
    create SampleDocument2 -V "{'a_key': 'a_value'}" -U couchbase://localhost/source ^
    --scope=data --collection=source ^
    -u Administrator -P password ^
    --expiry=600
----
Use the command-line KV client, e.g. the _cbc_ binary, and cut-n-paste one of the above commands to create the needed sample document.

We are passing --expiry the number of time in seconds from now at which the item should expire. However if you want an expiry over 30 days you must use the number of seconds since Unix Epoch.

On macOS (or OS-X) if you get a 'dyld: Library not loaded' when running _cbc_ a solution is documented in https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37768[MB-37768^].

Python SDK script::

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import couchbase.collection
import couchbase.subdocument as SD
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster, ClusterOptions
from couchbase_core.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.durability import ServerDurability, Durability
from datetime import timedelta

pa = PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password')
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://127.0.0.1', ClusterOptions(pa))
bucket = cluster.bucket('bulk')
collection = bucket.scope('data').collection('source')

try:
  document = dict( a_key="a_value" )
  result = collection.upsert(
    'SampleDocument2',
    document,
    expiry=timedelta(minutes=10)
  )
  print("UPSERT SUCCESS")
  print("cas result:", result.cas)
except:
  print("exception:", sys.exc_info())
----
Make an executable script as above and then it.  Alternatively run the command _python3_ to start a Python session then cut-n-paste the above line (without the `#!/usr/bin/python3` line) to create the needed sample document and then ^D (or ctrl-D) to close the Python session.

. You now have a document in collection 'source' (keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`) with an expiration set. 

. To verify that your new document was created, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page and click the *Documents* then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`.
The new document gets displayed automatically (as this page will attempt to list the first few items). You will see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` keyspace (this will disappear on the document's expiry of 10 minutes).
+

. [Optional Step] Click on the document's id, *SampleDocument2* to view the documents Data and also the documents Metadata information.  Note that the "expiration" field in the Metadata is non-zero (set to a  Unix timestamp in seconds since epoch).
. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-down, select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the keyspace.
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-down, select *rr100*, *eventing*, *metadata* as the keyspace.
 ** Enter *delete_v_expiry* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** Leave the "Deployment Feed Boundary" as Everything.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Function to show how to determine if a document removal is an expiration or a deletion*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** Skip the *Bindings* options
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::del_v_expiry_01_settings.png[,484,align=left]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *delete_v_expiry* dialog appears.
** The *delete_v_expiry* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *delete_v_expiry* code in this block.
+
image::del_v_expiry_02_editor_with_default.png[,100%,align=left]
** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *delete_v_expiry* dialog.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnDelete(meta, options) {
    if (options.expired) {
        log("doc expired:",meta.id);
    } else {
        log("doc deleted:",meta.id);
    }
}
----

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::del_v_expiry_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%,align=left]
** Click *Save and Return*.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *delete_v_expiry* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.
+
image::del_v_expiry_03a_deploy.png[,100%]
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds.  From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.

. When its expiration time is reached, an item is deleted as soon as one of the following occurs:

* An attempt is made to access the item.
* The expiry pager is run (default every 60 minutes).
* Compaction is run. 

. Therefore we first wait the full 10 minute period from the creation of SampleDocument2 and then we will try to access the document to expedite the expiry occurrence.  

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
** You may see document count of one or zero depending in the Bucket *bulk* if the expiry pager has run. 
+
image::del_v_expiry_04_view_bkt.png[,100%,align=left]

. Click on the *Documents* in the UI  you will see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` keyspace (this will disappear on the document's expiry of 10 minutes).
If the expiration on the document SampleDocument2 has occurred there will be no documents found.
+
image::del_v_expiry_04b_view_doc.png[,100%,align=left]

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page for a second time.  
** You should see the document count is zero for the bucket *source* as we have attempted to access the item and it has been recognized and marked as an expired tombstone.
+
image::del_v_expiry_04b_view_bkt.png[,100%,align=left]

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click the function name *delete_v_expire*.
** You should see the following statistics under the Deployment Statistics:
+
image::del_v_expiry_04_expiration.png[,100%,align=left]

. Click the "Log" link for *delete_v_expiry* to view the activity (the "*Log*" link will appear in the upper right of the Function's controls once the function is deployed).
** You should see that the document has expired.

----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** just keep the above text
** Click *Save*.

. Now click the trash can icon to delete the *SampleDocument3* you just created.  Select *Continue* to confirm the deletion.

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click the function name *delete_v_expire*. 
** You should see following statistics under the Deployment Statistics:
+
image::del_v_expiry_06_deletion.png[,100%,align=left]

. Click the "Log" link for *delete_v_expiry* to view the activity (the "*Log*" link will appear in the upper right of the Function's controls once the function is deployed).
** Here we see the document was deleted.

*Cleanup*:

Go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *delete_v_expiry*, this will remove the 1280 documents for each function from the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' colection (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' keyspace if there are no deployed Eventing Functions.

Now flush the 'bulk' bucket if you plan to run other examples (you may need to Edit the bucket 'bulk' and enable the flush capability).
