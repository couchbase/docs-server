= Examples: Using the Eventing Service

[abstract]
This page contains examples of how to use the Eventing Service, using the Couchbase Web Console.

[#example-1]
== Example 1

*Goal*: A document contains attributes whose form makes them difficult to search on.
Therefore, on the document's creation or modification, a new attribute should be created to accompany each original attribute; this new attribute being instantiated with a value that directly corresponds to that of its associated, original attribute; but takes a different form, thereby becoming more supportive of search.
Original attributes are subsequently retrievable based on successful searches performed on new attributes.

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens for data-changes within a specified, source bucket.
When any document within the bucket is created or mutated, the handler executes a user-defined routine.
In this example, if the created or mutated document contains two specifically named fields containing IP addresses (these respectively corresponding to the beginning and end of an address-range), the handler-routine converts each IP address to an integer.
A new document is created in a specified, target bucket: this new document is identical to the old, except that it has two additional fields, which contain integers that correspond to the IP addresses.
The original document, in the source bucket, is not changed.

*Preparations*

This example requires the creation of three buckets: metadata, target and source buckets.

Proceed as follows:

. Create target and metadata buckets.
To create a bucket, refer to xref:clustersetup:create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
The target bucket contains documents that will be created by the Function.
Don’t add any documents explicitly to this bucket.
. Follow Step 1.
and create a source bucket.
In the Source bucket screen:
 .. Click *Add Document*.
 .. In the *Add Document* window, specify the name *SampleDocument* as the *New**Document ID*
 .. Click *Save*.
 .. In the *Edit Document* dialog, paste the following within the edit panel.
+
[cols=1*]
|===
| {

"country": "AD",

"ip_end": "5.62.60.9",

"ip_start": "5.62.60.1"

}
|===

 .. Click *Save*.
This step concludes all required preparations.

*Procedure*

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the Source Bucket drop-down, select the *source* _option_ that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the Metadata Bucket drop-down, select the *metadata* _option_ that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *enrich_ip_nums* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Enrich a document, converts IP Strings to Integers that are stored in new attributes,* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the Bindings option, specify *target* as the name of the bucket, and specify *tgt* as the associated value.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *enrich_ip_nums* dialog appears.
The *enrich_ip_nums* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *enrich_ip_nums* code in this block.
+
image::addfunctions_ex1.png[,400]

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *enrich_ip_nums* dialog:
+
----
 function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  log('document', doc);
  doc["ip_num_start"] = get_numip_first_3_octets(doc["ip_start"]);
  doc["ip_num_end"]   = get_numip_first_3_octets(doc["ip_end"]);
  tgt[meta.id]=doc;
}

function get_numip_first_3_octets(ip)
{
  var return_val = 0;
  if (ip)
  {
    var parts = ip.split('.');

    //IP Number = A x (256*256*256) + B x (256*256) + C x 256 + D
    return_val = (parts[0]*(256*256*256)) + (parts[1]*(256*256)) + (parts[2]*256) + parseInt(parts[3]);
    return return_val;
  }
}
----
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::enrich_ip_nums.png[,500]
+
The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the bucket, the routine *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run on each document that contains *ip_start* and *ip_end*.
A new document is created whose data and metadata are based on those of the document on which *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run; but with the addition of *ip_num_start* and *ip_num_end data-fields*, which contain the numeric values returned by *get_numip_first_3_octets*.
The *get_numip_first_3_octets* routine splits the IP address, converts each fragment to a numeral, and adds the numerals together, to form a single value; which it returns.

. Click *Save*.
. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing* and click on the newly created Function name.
The Function *enrich_ip_nums* is listed as a defined Function.
+
image::deploy_enrich_ip_nums.png[,400]

. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. To check results of the deployed Function, click the *Documents* tab.
. Select *target* bucket from the *Bucket* drop-down.As this shows, a version of *SampleDocument* has been added to the *target* bucket.
It contains all the attributes of the original document, with the addition of *ip_num_start* and *ip_num_end*; which contain the numeric values that correspond to *ip_start* and *ip_end*, respectively.
Additional documents added to the *source* bucket, which share the *ip_start* and *ip_end* attributes, will be similarly handled by the defined Function: creating such a document, and changing any attribute in such a document both cause the Function's execution.

[#example-2]
== Example 2

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage Eventing Service in the Banking and Financial domain.
When a credit card transaction exceeds the user’s available credit limit, to indicate a high-risk transaction, an alert can be generated.

This example requires you to create four buckets: *flagged_transactions, users, metadata*_and_ *transactions*_buckets_.
For steps on how to create buckets, see https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[[.underline]#Create Bucket#^].

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *transactions* source bucket.
When a document within the source bucket is created or mutated, the handler executes a user-defined routine.
In this example, if the created or mutated document contains a high-risk transaction, a new document gets created in a specified, *flagged_transactions* bucket.

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*,to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the Source Bucket drop-down, select *transactions* that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the Metadata Bucket drop-down, select *metadata* that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *high_risks_transactions* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Functions that computes risky transaction and flags them,* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
For the first binding specify *users* as the *name* of the bucket, and specify *user* as the associated *value*.
For the second binding, specify *flagged_transactions* as the *name* of the bucket, and specify *high_risk* as the associated *value*.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *high_risks_transactions* dialog appears.
+
The *high_risks_transactions* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *high_risks_transactions* code in this block.
+
image::add_functions_code_exp2.png[,400]

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *high_risks_transactions* dialog:
+
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    try
    {
        //log('txn id:', meta.id, '; user_id:', doc.user_id , ', doc.amount:', doc.amount);
        var this_user = getUser(doc.user_id);
        if (this_user)
        {
            if(this_user['creditlimit'] < doc.amount)
            {
                log('Txn['+String(meta.id)+']*****High Risk Transaction as Txn Amount:'+ String(doc.amount)+' exceeds Credit Limit:',this_user['creditlimit']);
                doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction as Txn Amount exceeds Credit Limit " +String(this_user['creditlimit']);
                doc["reason_code"] = "X-CREDIT";
                high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
                return;
            }
            else
            {
                if(doc.txn_currency != this_user['currency'])
                {
                    log('Txn['+ String(meta.id) +']*****High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:'+ this_user['currency']);
                    doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:" + this_user['currency'];
                    doc["reason_code"] = "XE-MISMATCH";
                    high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
                    return;
                }
            }
            //log('Acceptable Transaction:',doc.amount, ' for Credit Limit:', this_user['creditlimit']);
        }
        else
        {
            log('Txn['+ String(meta.id) + "] User Does not Exist:" + String(doc.user_id) );
        }
     }
    catch (e)
    {
        log('Error OnUpdate :', String(meta.id), e);
    }
}

function OnDelete(meta) {
    log('Document OnDelete:', meta.id);
}

function getUser(userId)
{
    try
    {
        if(userId != null)
        {
            return user[userId];
        }
    }
    catch (e)
    {
        log('Error getUser :', userId,'; Exception:', e);
    }
    return null;
}
----
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::high_risks_transactions_handler_code.png[,600]
+
The OnUpdate handler is triggered for every transaction.
The handler checks if the transaction amount is less than the user’s available credit limit.
When this condition is breached, then this transaction is flagged as a high-risk transaction.
The Function _high_risks_transactions_ then moves this transaction to a different bucket, _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
When the transaction is moved to a new bucket, the handler enriches the document with predefined _comments_ and also provides a _reason code_*.* In the last part, the handler performs a currency validation step.
If the transaction currency is other than the preconfigured home currency of the user, then the handler flags the transactions and moves it to a different bucket.

. Click *Save*.
. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing*.
+
image::high_risks_transactions_handler_deploy.png[,400]
+
The Function __high_risks_transactions__is listed as a defined Function.
Currently, it is listed as *Undeployed* and *Paused*.

. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
This deploys the Function and displays the main *Eventing* screen.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. To check results of the deployed Function, after a sufficient time elapse, from the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *Buckets*.
. Click _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
All documents available in this bucket are transactions that are flagged as high-risk transactions.
+
image::buckets.png[,600]
+
This indicates that transactions which were flagged as high risk gets moved to the _flagged_transactions_ bucket.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page, execute the below N1QL query:
+
----
SELECT reason_code, COUNT(1), num_txns, SUM(amount) amount
FROM `flagged_transactions`
GROUP BY reason_code;
----
+

[#example-3]
== Example 3

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage the Eventing Service to perform a cascade delete operation.
When a user is deleted, Couchbase Functions provide a reliable method to delete all the associated documents with the deleted user.

This example requires you to create three buckets: users, metadata and transactions buckets.

For steps to create buckets, see https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[[.underline]#Create Bucket#^].

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnDelete* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *users* source bucket.
When a user within the source bucket gets deleted, the handler executes a routine to remove the deleted user.
When the delete operation is complete, all associated documents of the delete users get removed.

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*,to add a new Function.
+
image::functions_add_4exp3.png[,400]

. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements, provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select the *Users* that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select the *metadata* that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *delete_orphaned_txns* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Delete Orphaned Transactions from the `transactions’ bucket when user_id is less than 10* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, specify *users* as the *name* of the bucket and specify **src**_**user** as the associated *value*.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog appears.
+
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *delete_orphaned_txns* code in this block.
+
image::addfunctions-code_exp3.png[,400]

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *delete_orphaned_txns* screen:
+
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('OnUpdate document:', meta.id);
}

function OnDelete(meta) {
    log('Document Deleted:', meta.id);
    if(meta.id < 10)
    {
       try
       {
            var this_user_id = meta.id;
            var del = delete from `transactions` where user_id = TONUMBER($this_user_id);
            del.execQuery();
            log('Deleted Orphaned Transactions for User:', this_user_id);
       }
       catch(e)
       {
           log('Exception:', e)
       }
    }
}
----
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::ondelete-functions.png[,600]
+
The *OnDelete* handler is triggered for user delete transaction.
The handler checks if the *user_id* is less than 10.
When this condition is fulfilled, then an N1QL query is triggered to delete all user related information.
The handler is then configured to record this delete operation in a Function specific application log file.
.

. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing*.
The Function *delete_orphaned_txns* is listed as a defined Function.
Currently, it is listed as *Undeployed* and *Paused*.
. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. Navigate to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page.
Before deleting a user, a snapshot of *Query Result* from the *users* bucket is displayed:
+
image::queryresults_ondelerte.png[,400]

. The *Query Results* display users with **user_id**s from 1 to 10.
. Navigate to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
Delete two users from the *Users* bucket:
 ** Select *User4* from the list and click the *delete* icon.
 ** Select *User10* from the list and click the *delete* icon.
. From the *Query Editor*, execute an N1QL query to check that all related records for the deleted users are removed from the cluster.
+
----
SELECT user_id, COUNT(1) FROM `Users` GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY user_id ASC;
----
+
image::query-results-ondelete.png[,400]

. In the *Query Results* pane notice that user_ids, *user_id4* and *user_id 10* are removed as part of the cascade user delete operation.

== Example 4

*Goal*: When a document in an existing bucket is about to expire, a new document is created in a newly created bucket.

*Implementation*: Write an OnUpdate handler, which runs whenever a document is created or mutated.
The handler calls a timer routine, which executes a callback function, two minutes prior to any document’s established expiration.
This function retrieves a specified value from the document, and stores it in a document of the same name, in a specified target bucket.
The original document in the source bucket is not changed..

For this example, the buckets created such as source, target, and metadata buckets, are used.
A new document is created within the source bucket, and this document has its expiration — or Time To Live (TTL) — set to occur ten minutes after the document's creation.

Python script for this Example is provided for reference.
Using the Couchbase SDK, you can create or modify the document expiration.
In this example, the Couchbase SDK Python client creates a document and sets the document's expiration.

----
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
from couchbase.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
import time
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost:8091')
authenticator = PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password')
cluster.authenticate(authenticator)

cb = cluster.open_bucket('source')
cb.upsert('SampleDocument2', {'a_key': 'a_value'})
cb.touch('SampleDocument2', ttl=10*60)
----

The script imports a Couchbase cluster object, and authenticates against it, using (for demonstration purposes) the Full Administrator username and password (the cluster is assumed to be accessible on localhost).
The script then opens the existing source bucket, and inserts a new document, named *SampleDocument2*, whose body is *{'a_key': 'a_value'}*.

For information on installing the Couchbase Python SDK, refer to xref:java-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK].
For information on using the Couchbase Python SDK to establish bucket-expiration, refer to xref:dotnet-sdk::document-operations.adoc[Document Operations].

*Procedure*

Proceed as follows:

. Install the Couchbase SDK Python client and from the appropriate folder, start Python.
+
----
./python
----

. On the Python prompt, enter the provided code.
+
----
>>> from couchbase.cluster import Cluster
>>> from couchbase.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
>>> import time
>>> cluster = Cluster('couchbase://localhost:8091')
>>> authenticator = PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password')
>>> cluster.authenticate(authenticator)
>>> cb = cluster.open_bucket('source')
>>> cb.upsert('SampleDocument2', {'a_key': 'a_value'})
OperationResult<rc=0x0, key='SampleDocument2', cas=0x1519ec8cdee90000>
>>> cb.touch('SampleDocument2', ttl=10*60)
OperationResult<rc=0x0, key='SampleDocument2', cas=0x1519ec8e686c0000>
>>>

. To verify bucket creation, access the *Buckets* screen from the *Couchbase Web Console* and click the *Document* tab of the *Source* bucket.
The new document gets displayed.
. [Optional Step] Click on a document's id to view the metadata information.
. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *source*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *add_timer_before_expiry* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *FunctionName* text-box.
 ** Enter text *Function that adds timer before document expiry*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
For the first binding specify *source* as the name of the bucket, and specify *src* as the associated value.
For the second binding, specify *target* as the name of the bucket, and specify *tgt* as the associated value.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *add_timer_before_expiry* dialog appears.
. The *add_timer_before_expiry* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *add_timer_before_expiry code* in this block.
+
image::casacade_del_withcode.png[,600]

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *add_timer_before_expiry* dialog.
+
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
 if (meta.expiration > 0 ) //do only for those documents that have a non-zero TTL
     {
       var expiry = new Date(meta.expiration);
       // Compute 2 minutes from the TTL timestamp
        var twoMinsPrior = new Date(expiry.setMinutes(expiry.getMinutes()-2));
        var context = {docID : meta.id};
        createTimer(DocTimerCallback, twoMinsPrior , meta.id, context);
        log('Added Doc Timer to DocId:', meta.id);
      }
}
function DocTimerCallback(context)
     {
       log('DocTimerCallback Executed for DocId:', String(context.docID));
       tgt[context.docID] = "To Be Expired Key's Value is:" + JSON.stringify(src[context.docID]);
       log('Doc Timer Executed for DocId', String(context.docID));
     }
----

+
image::cascade_delete_buckets.png[,600]
+
As a result, a new document — like the original, named *SourceDocument2* — is created, with a value based on that of the original.
After two minutes has elapsed, check the documents within the source bucket: the original *SourceDocument2* is no longer visible, having been removed at its defined expiration-time.
