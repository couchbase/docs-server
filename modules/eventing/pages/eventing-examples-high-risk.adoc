= Risk Assessment


*Goal*: To leverage Eventing Service in the Banking and Financial domain. When a credit card transaction exceeds the user’s available credit limit, an alert can be generated to indicate a high-risk transaction.

This example requires you to create four buckets: flagged_transactions, users, metadata and transactions buckets.

For steps on how to create buckets, see https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.1/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[[.underline]#Create Bucket#^].

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *transactions* source bucket.
When a document within the source bucket is created or mutated, the handler executes a user-defined routine.
In this example, if the created or mutated document contains a high-risk transaction, a new document gets created in a specified, *flagged_transactions* bucket.

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*,to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the Source Bucket drop-down, select *transactions* that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the Metadata Bucket drop-down, select *metadata* that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *high_risks_transactions* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Functions that computes risky transaction and flags them,* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
For the first binding specify *users* as the *name* of the bucket, and specify *user* as the associated *value*.
For the second binding, specify *flagged_transactions* as the *name* of the bucket, and specify *high_risk* as the associated *value*.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *high_risks_transactions* dialog appears.
+
The *high_risks_transactions* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *high_risks_transactions* code in this block.

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *high_risks_transactions* dialog:

----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    try
    {
        //log('txn id:', meta.id, '; user_id:', doc.user_id , ', doc.amount:', doc.amount);
        var this_user = getUser(doc.user_id);
        if (this_user)
        {
            if(this_user['creditlimit'] < doc.amount)
            {
                log('Txn['+String(meta.id)+']*****High Risk Transaction as Txn Amount:'+ String(doc.amount)+' exceeds Credit Limit:',this_user['creditlimit']);
                doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction as Txn Amount exceeds Credit Limit " +String(this_user['creditlimit']);
                doc["reason_code"] = "X-CREDIT";
                high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
                return;
            }
            else
            {
                if(doc.txn_currency != this_user['currency'])
                {
                    log('Txn['+ String(meta.id) +']*****High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:'+ this_user['currency']);
                    doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:" + this_user['currency'];
                    doc["reason_code"] = "XE-MISMATCH";
                    high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
                    return;
                }
            }
            //log('Acceptable Transaction:',doc.amount, ' for Credit Limit:', this_user['creditlimit']);
        }
        else
        {
            log('Txn['+ String(meta.id) + "] User Does not Exist:" + String(doc.user_id) );
        }
     }
    catch (e)
    {
        log('Error OnUpdate :', String(meta.id), e);
    }
}

function OnDelete(meta) {
    log('Document OnDelete:', meta.id);
}

function getUser(userId)
{
    try
    {
        if(userId != null)
        {
            return user[userId];
        }
    }
    catch (e)
    {
        log('Error getUser :', userId,'; Exception:', e);
    }
    return null;
}

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::high_risks_transactions_handler_code.png[,600]
+
The OnUpdate handler is triggered for every transaction.
The handler checks if the transaction amount is less than the user’s available credit limit.
When this condition is breached, then this transaction is flagged as a high-risk transaction.
The Function _high_risks_transactions_ then moves this transaction to a different bucket, _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
When the transaction is moved to a new bucket, the handler enriches the document with predefined _comments_ and also provides a _reason code_*.* In the last part, the handler performs a currency validation step.
If the transaction currency is other than the preconfigured home currency of the user, then the handler flags the transactions and moves it to a different bucket.

. Click *Save*.
. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing*.
+
image::high_risks_transactions_handler_deploy.png[,400]
+
The Function __high_risks_transactions__is listed as a defined Function.
Currently, it is listed as *Undeployed* and *Paused*.

. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
This deploys the Function and displays the main *Eventing* screen.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. To check results of the deployed Function, after a sufficient time elapse, from the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *Buckets*.
. Click _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
All documents available in this bucket are transactions that are flagged as high-risk transactions.
+
image::buckets.png[,600]
+
This indicates that transactions which were flagged as high risk gets moved to the _flagged_transactions_ bucket.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page, execute the below N1QL query:
+
----
SELECT reason_code, COUNT(1), num_txns, SUM(amount) amount
FROM `flagged_transactions`
GROUP BY reason_code;
