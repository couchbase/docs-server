= Risk Assessment
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage Eventing Service in the Banking and Financial domain.
When a credit card transaction exceeds the user’s available credit limit, to indicate a high-risk transaction, an alert can be generated.


*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *transactions* source bucket.
When a document within the source bucket is created or mutated, the handler executes a user-defined routine.
In this example, if the created or mutated document contains a high-risk transaction, a new document gets created in a specified, *flagged_transactions* bucket.

*Preparations*:

For this example, four buckets 'flagged_transactions', 'users', 'transactions', and 'metadata', are required (note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions). Make all three buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

*Procedure*:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *transactions*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *high_risks_transactions* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Functions that computes risky transaction and flags them*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** Expand the *Settings* option
 *** Change only the *Language compatibility* which should be *6.0.0*.
 *** Unexpand the setting control
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *users* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *users* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
 *** For the second binding, select "bucket alias", specify *high_risk* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *flagged_transactions* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
** After configuring your settings your screen should look like:
+
image::highrisk_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *high_risks_transactions* dialog appears.
** The *high_risks_transactions* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *high_risks_transactions code* in this block.
+

** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *high_risks_transactions* dialog.

        doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction as Txn Amount exceeds Credit Limit " + String(this_user['creditlimit']);
        doc["reason_code"] = "X-CREDIT";
        high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
        return;
      } else {
        if (doc.txn_currency != this_user['currency']) {
          log('Txn[' + String(meta.id) + ']*****High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:' + this_user['currency']);
          doc["comments"] = "High Risk Transaction - Currency Mismatch:" + this_user['currency'];
          doc["reason_code"] = "XE-MISMATCH";
          high_risk[meta.id] = doc;
          return;
        }
      }
      //log('Acceptable Transaction:',doc.amount, ' for Credit Limit:', this_user['creditlimit']);
    } else {
      log('Txn[' + String(meta.id) + "] User Does not Exist:" + String(doc.user_id));
    }
  } catch (e) {
    log('Error OnUpdate :', String(meta.id), e);
  }
}

function OnDelete(meta) {
  log('Document OnDelete:', meta.id);
}

function getUser(userId) {
  try {
    if (userId != null) {
      return user[userId];
    }
  } catch (e) {
    log('Error getUser :', userId, '; Exception:', e);
  }
  return null;

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:

** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. The OnUpdate handler is triggered for every transaction.
The handler checks if the transaction amount is less than the user’s available credit limit.
When this condition is breached, then this transaction is flagged as a high-risk transaction.
The Function _high_risks_transactions_ then moves this transaction to a different bucket, _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
When the transaction is moved to a new bucket, the handler enriches the document with predefined _comments_ and also provides a _reason code_*.* In the last part, the handler performs a currency validation step.
If the transaction currency is other than the preconfigured home currency of the user, then the handler flags the transactions and moves it to a different bucket.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything from the Feed boundary* option.
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.


. To check the results of the deployed Function, after a sufficient time elapse, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page

. Click _flagged_transactions_ bucket.
All documents available in this bucket are transactions that are flagged as high-risk transactions.
+
image::highrisk_04_buckets.png[,%100]
+
This indicates that transactions which were flagged as high risk gets moved to the _flagged_transactions_ bucket.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page, execute the below N1QL query:
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT reason_code, COUNT(1), num_txns, SUM(amount) amount
FROM `flagged_transactions`
GROUP BY reason_code;
