= Risk Assessment
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage Eventing Service in the Banking and Financial domain.
When a credit card transaction either 1) exceeds the user’s available credit limit or 2) is made in a foreign currency, a high-risk transaction alert can be generated.

*Implementation*: 

Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens to data-changes within a specified, *'register'* source bucket.
When a document with type='transaction' within the source bucket is mutated, (created or changed), 
the Eventing handler executes user-defined code to respond to the change in real time.

*The Eventing function will*:

. Lookup details from the customers card information specifically: date, spending limits, location, and default currency. This data is from bucket *'register'* with type='card'.
. Lookup the exchange rates for the date from the transaction. This data is from bucket *'register'* with type='exchange_rates'.
. Normalize the currencies from both the transaction and the spending limit into USD (at the correct day's exchange rate).
. Determine if a spending threshold is exceeded (this is high risk).
. Determine if the purchase is a foreign purchase (this is high risk).
. For all high-risk transaction generate a new document containing both some transaction information and some calculated data.
. Write the new document representing the suspect transaction to the *'review'* bucket with type='transaction'.
. [OPTIONAL] Use of cURL directly from Eventing, use of a custom application written in various Couchbase SDKs, or use of third-party integrations like Kafka to read the items written to the *'review'* bucket (type='transaction') for further automated action.

*Preparations*:

For this example, three buckets *'register'*, *'review'*, and *'metadata'*, are required (note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions). Make all three buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

NOTE: The *'metadata'* bucket is for the sole use of the Eventing system. Do not add, modify, or delete documents from this bucket. In addition, do not drop or flush or delete the bucket while you have any deployed Eventing functions.

*Procedure*:

. Modify the *'review'* bucket to enable the ability to "flush" the items from the UI (_do not do this for the other two buckets_). Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page, and select the bucket '*review*' to expand the bucket view.
+
image::high_risk_txns_01_bucket_edit.png[,100%]
+
Now click on the *'Edit'* button to invoke the settings dialog for the '*review*' bucket. 
+
* Expand the 'Advanced bucket settings' control, then scroll to the bottom of the dialog 
and check the final control *'Flush [X] Enable'*.  
+
image::high_risk_txns_03_bucket_settings.png[,484]
+
To save this change click the *'Save Changes'* button. Your *'review'* bucket can now be flushed (as there is now a new button available for the action).
+
image::high_risk_txns_04_bucket_edit.png[,100%]
+
For more details on bucket settings and screen images refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc#couchbase-bucket-settings[Bucket Settings].

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page, build an index for the *'register'* bucket and an index for the '*review*' bucket:
+
[source,N1QL]
----
CREATE INDEX `adv_type` ON `register`(`type`);
CREATE INDEX `adv_type` ON `review`(`type`);
----
+
Copy and paste the two lines of text (above) into the Query Workbench and click *'Execute'*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_05_create_indexes.png[,100%]
+
Although the above indexes are technically not needed for our Eventing function they will come in useful for exploring
the documents imported to the *'register'* bucket and inserted into the '*review*' by our Eventing Function using the N1QL language in the Query Workbench.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *register*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *high_risk_txns* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Flag items over credit threshold or a foreign transaction*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
  *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *register* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *register* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
  *** For the second binding, select "bucket alias", specify *review* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *review* as the associated bucket, and select "read and write".  
 ** After configuring your settings your dialog should look like this:
+
image::high_risk_txns_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *high_risk_txns* dialog appears.
** The *high_risk_txns* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *high_risk_txns code* in this block.
+

** Click *Save*.

. The *OnUpdate* handler above is triggered for every transaction. 
The handler checks if the transaction amount is less than the user’s available credit limit.
When this condition is breached, then this transaction is flagged as a high-risk transaction.
In addition, the handler checks if a foreign currency purchase has occurred, this is also flagged as a high-risk transaction.
+
The Function *high_risk_txns* then copies the transaction to the *review* bucket (but it removes some unneeded data and adds some enriched data). The handler enriches the document with predefined _comments_ and also provides a _reason code_. In the last part, the handler performs a currency validation step.
+
The handler also converts both the credit limit and the transaction amount to a common currency, in this case USD, based upon current exchange rates on the exact date of the given transaction.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page, run a few N1QL queries on the new documents create in the *'review*' bucket:
+
*QUERY A*, see how many high-risk transactions we found.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) num_high_risk FROM review WHERE type='transaction';
----
+
image::high_risk_txns_09_n1ql_a.png[,%100]
+
*QUERY B*, look at all the data and with a specific order.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM review WHERE type='transaction' ORDER BY currency, amount DESC;
----
+
image::high_risk_txns_09_n1ql_b.png[,%100]
+
*QUERY C*, look at the summarized data and with a specific order and grouping.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) count, reason_code, SUM(amount) total_amount, currency 
FROM review WHERE type='transaction' 
GROUP BY reason_code, currency;
----
+
image::high_risk_txns_09_n1ql_c.png[,%100]
+
*QUERY D*, look at a transaction record or document by key.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM register USE KEYS ('transaction:tx-1505315650-403');
----
+
image::high_risk_txns_09_n1ql_d.png[,%100]
+
*QUERY E*, look at a card record or document by key.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM register USE KEYS ('card:4273-6623-8686-4599');
----
+
image::high_risk_txns_09_n1ql_e.png[,%100]
+
*QUERY F*, look at a flagged transaction record or document that we wrote by key.
+
[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM review USE KEYS ('transaction:tx-1505315650-403');

. The next step is to follow the Function logic in detail. To do this we need to 'flush' all the generated documents in review.
Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page. You should see 40 documents in the '*review*' bucket.  Select the bucket '*review*' to expand the bucket view. Next click on the *'Flush'* button.
+
** In the *Confirm Flush Bucket* dialog, click *Flush Bucket*. In a while the document count will drop to 0.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_flush_review.png[,%100]

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *high_risk_txns* to expand the function, and then click *Pause*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_pause.png[,%100]
+
** In the *Confirm Pause Function* dialog, click *Pause Function*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_pause_confirm.png[,344]
+
** The Eventing function is paused in a few seconds and can be edited. Click the *'Edit JavaScript'* button.
** In the Editor dialog change the OnUpdate handler code from `var verbose = 0` to `var verbose = 3` -- you are only modifying line four of the *high_risk_txns* function as below:
+
[source,JavaScript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  if (doc.type != "transaction") return;
  try {
    var verbose = 3; // logging - 0: minimal, 1: moderate, 2: massive 
    // *** many lines not shown ***
----
** Click *'Save'*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the *'< back to Eventing'* link (below the editor) or click the *Eventing* tab.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Resume*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_resume.png[,%100]
** In the *Confirm Resume Function* dialog, click *Resume Function*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_resume_confirm.png[,346]

. The Eventing function is resumed from the check point created when you paused the function and will start running within a few seconds. The defined function is executed on all new document documents and on subsequent mutations. Until a mutation is triggered there will be no processing at all by our modified handler's JavaScript code.

. The next step is to create one mutation, to do this access 
the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page. 
** Click the *Documents* link of the *register* bucket (the source of the mutations that our Function watches). 
** Select the document `transaction:tx-1505315650-403` by cutting and pasting this ID into the *Document ID* text box and hitting kbd:[Return].  
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_bucket_register_id.png[,%100]
+
** This should display a single document. Edit it by clicking on it.
** Adjust the document slightly from `"amount": 5383.35` to `"amount": 5383.36`.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_modify.png[,580]
+
** Click *'Save'*.
** Inspect the new data written to the "high_risk_txns.log" in the file system (or alternatively use the UI's Log link).

Above we see that for one mutation the Function *high_risk_txns* printed the following log messages:
** The transaction document 'doc' that mutated (what you just changed).
** The 'card' or credit card that the transaction was made with was looked up via the key _'card:' + doc.card_ from the bucket alias  register.
** A daily 'rates' or exchange rates for the date of the transaction which was looked up via the key _'exchange_rates:er-' + (doc.date).substr(0, 10))_ from the bucket alias register.
** Next a bit of information (4 lines) was emitted  to show what was done in order to make the final decision.
** Finally, the last log line is the decision line (if the transaction is considered 'High Risk').
The amount of information at this verbosity level would be excessive for millions of documents, however it can be very handy for developing and debugging Eventing handler JavaScript logic.

. Cleanup involves undeploying and deleting the function and then removing the three buckets you created. This concludes the Example.

** From the *Eventing* screen, click *Undeploy*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_10_pause.png[,%100]
+
** In the *Confirm Undeploy Function* dialog, click *high_risk_txns* to expand the function, and then click *Undeploy Function*.
+
image::high_risk_txns_11_undeploy_confirm.png[,346]

** The Eventing function will be undeployed within a few seconds.

** Undeploying the function *high_risk_txns* removes the 1024 documents (64 for macOS) from the *metadata* bucket, as you can see in the Bucket view of the UI. Remember you may only delete the *metadata* bucket if there are no currently deployed Eventing functions.

** To remove all of the artifacts: 1) delete the *high_risk_txns* function from the *Eventing* screen 2) delete the three buckets *register*, *review*, and *metadata* in the Bucket view of the UI (the latter, *metadata*, should be empty).
