= Cancel or Overwrite a Timer
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: Demonstrate the functionality for canceling or overwriting an Eventing Timer.

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler and a Timer callback function. The handler listens for mutations or data-changes within a specified source bucket. When any document within the bucket is created or modified, the handler executes a user-defined routine. In this example, we rely on a control document which if mutated controls whether a Timer will be created, canceled, or overwritten.

** *Test 1*: The control document is created or mutated in such a way a Timer is created and fires approximately 60 seconds in the future at which point a document is written to another bucket. The original control document, in the source bucket, is not changed.

** *Test 2*: The control document is mutated in such a way that any existing Timer with the reference of the control document's id (meta.id) is canceled. This has no effect if the Timer created has already fired.

** *Test 3*: The control document is mutated in such a way that any existing Timer with the reference of the control document's id (meta.id) is overwritten. This is equivalent to canceling a timer that already exists, and then creating a new Timer that will fire approximately 60 seconds in the future.

*Preparations (Common)*

For this example, three buckets 'source', 'target', and 'metadata', are required. Note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions. Make all three buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

NOTE: The 'metadata' bucket is for the sole use of the Eventing system. Do not add, modify, or delete documents from this bucket. In addition do not drop or flush or delete the bucket while you have any deployed Eventing functions.

*Setup*:

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
** You should see the following once you have created your buckets:
+

----
{
  "type": "type_of_interest",
  "id": 1,
  "needed_condition": false,
  "cancel_timer": false,
  "overwrite_timer": false,
  "a_number": 1
}

** Click *Save*.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *source*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *cancel_overwrite_timer* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Explore creating, canceling, and overwriting timers*, in the *Description* text-box.
  ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add just one binding.
 *** For the binding, select the "bucket alias", specify *tgt_bkt* as the "alias name" of the bucket, select *target* as the associated bucket, and select "read and write".
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::cancel_overwrite_timer_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *cancel_overwrite_timer* dialog appears.
** The *cancel_overwrite_timer* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *cancel_overwrite_timer* code in this block.

function DocTimerCallback(context) {
   log('From DocTimerCallback: timer fired', context);

   // Create a new document as per our received context in another bucket
   tgt_bkt[context.docId] = context; // upsert the context as our new doc
}

function OnUpdate(doc,meta) {
   // You would typically filter to mutations of interest 
   if (doc.type != 'type_of_interest') return;
   
   // You would typically look at some key conditions to decide what to do
   if (doc.needed_condition === true && doc.cancel_timer === false) {
       if (doc.overwrite_timer === true) {
         log('From OnUpdate: overwriting timer with same reference', meta.id);

       }
       // Create a timestamp 60 seconds from now
       var oneMinuteFromNow = new Date(); // Get current time & add 60 sec. to it.
       oneMinuteFromNow.setSeconds(oneMinuteFromNow.getSeconds() + 60);
   
       // Create a document to use as out for our context
       var context = {docId : meta.id, random_text : "arbitrary text", "tmr_time_to_fire": oneMinuteFromNow};
       createTimer(DocTimerCallback, oneMinuteFromNow, meta.id, context);
    }
    if (doc.cancel_timer === true && doc.overwrite_timer === false) {
       // Cancel an existing timer (if it is active) by reference meta.id
       if (cancelTimer(DocTimerCallback, meta.id)) {
           log('From OnUpdate: cancel request, timer was canceled',meta.id);
       } else {
           log('From OnUpdate: cancel request, no such timer may have fired',meta.id);
       }

image::cancel_overwrite_timer_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the bucket, actions will be processed according to the field within the document.  First we ignore all documents that do not have a doc.type of "type_of_interest" this is the control document.  Next we use the field as "needed_condition", "cancel_timer", and "overwrite_timer" to determine which action we take.  

* If "needed_condition" is true and both "cancel_timer", and "overwrite_timer" are false we will create a Timer that will fire approximately 60 seconds in the future.
* If "needed_condition" is true and "cancel_timer" is true we will cancel the existing Timer.
* If "needed_condition" is true and "overwrite_timer" is true we will overwrite the existing Timer with a new one (assuming that our Timer is still active) which will fire approximately 60 seconds in the future.
* If both "cancel_timer" and "overwrite_timer" are true it is considered an error and no action is taken.
* In the event a Timer created by this Function fires the callback *DocTimerCallback* executes and will write a new document with the same KEY (as the "source" bucket) into the "destination" bucket.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *cancel_overwrite_timer* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything* from the *Feed boundary* option.
** Starting with version 6.6.2, selecting a Feed Boundary has been deprecated and the Feed Boundary is read from the Function's settings. [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.2#
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and will also more importantly it will also run on subsequent mutations.


== Test 1: Create a Timer and allow the Timer to Fire

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** Edit the control document type_of_interest::1 -- it should look like:
+
----
{
  "type": "type_of_interest",
  "id": 1,
  "needed_condition": false,
  "cancel_timer": false,
  "overwrite_timer": false,
  "a_number": 1
}
----
+
Change "needed_condition" to true to create a mutation, then click *Save*.  This will create a mutation and then the Function will generate a Timer.  The control document is now:
+
----
{
  "type": "type_of_interest",
  "id": 1,
  "needed_condition": true,
  "cancel_timer": false,
  "overwrite_timer": false,
  "a_number": 1
}
----

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and click on the Function *cancel_overwrite_timer* then click the "Log" link for Deployed Function *cancel_overwrite_timer* to view the activity.  
** Here we see from the Application log that we created a timer.

** Click *Cancel* to close the editor.

. Click the trash can icon to delete the document, then click *Continue* to confirm the deletion.

*Cleanup*:

To  clean up, go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *cancel_overwrite_timer*. This will remove the 2048 documents for each function from the 'metadata' bucket (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'metadata' bucket if there are no deployed Eventing functions.
