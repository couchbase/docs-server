= Data Enrichment

== Goal: A document contains attributes whose form makes them difficult to search on.
Therefore, on the document's creation or modification, a new attribute should be created to accompany each original attribute; this new attribute being instantiated with a value that directly corresponds to that of its associated, original attribute; but takes a different form, thereby becoming more supportive of search.
Original attributes are subsequently retrievable based on successful searches performed on new attributes.

== Implementation: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler.
The handler listens for data-changes within a specified, source bucket.
When any document within the bucket is created or mutated, the handler executes a user-defined routine.
In this example, if the created or mutated document contains two specifically named fields containing IP addresses (these respectively corresponding to the beginning and end of an address-range), the handler-routine converts each IP address to an integer.
A new document is created in a specified, target bucket: this new document is identical to the old, except that it has two additional fields, which contain integers that correspond to the IP addresses.
The original document, in the source bucket, is not changed.

== Preparations*

This example requires the creation of three buckets: metadata, target and source buckets.

Proceed as follows:

. Create target and metadata buckets.
To create a bucket, refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
The target bucket contains documents that will be created by the Function.
Donâ€™t add any documents explicitly to this bucket.
. Follow Step 1.
and create a source bucket.
In the Source bucket screen:
 .. Click *Add Document*.
 .. In the *Add Document* window, specify the name *SampleDocument* as the *New**Document ID*
 .. Click *Save*.
 .. In the *Edit Document* dialog, paste the following within the edit panel.
+
[cols=1*]
|===
| {

"country": "AD",

"ip_end": "5.62.60.9",

"ip_start": "5.62.60.1"

}
|===

 .. Click *Save*.
This step concludes all required preparations.

*Procedure*

Proceed as follows:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the Source Bucket drop-down, select the *source* _option_ that was created for this purpose.
 ** For the Metadata Bucket drop-down, select the *metadata* _option_ that was created for this purpose.
 ** Enter *enrich_ip_nums* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function**Name* text-box.
 ** Enter *Enrich a document, converts IP Strings to Integers that are stored in new attributes,* in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the Bindings option, specify *target* as the name of the bucket, and specify *tgt* as the associated value.
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next*: *Add Code*.
The *enrich_ip_nums* dialog appears.
The *enrich_ip_nums* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *enrich_ip_nums* code in this block.
+

. Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of the *enrich_ip_nums* dialog:
+
----
 function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  log('document', doc);
  doc["ip_num_start"] = get_numip_first_3_octets(doc["ip_start"]);
  doc["ip_num_end"]   = get_numip_first_3_octets(doc["ip_end"]);
  tgt[meta.id]=doc;
}

function get_numip_first_3_octets(ip)
{
  var return_val = 0;
  if (ip)
  {
    var parts = ip.split('.');

    //IP Number = A x (256*256*256) + B x (256*256) + C x 256 + D
    return_val = (parts[0]*(256*256*256)) + (parts[1]*(256*256)) + (parts[2]*256) + parseInt(parts[3]);
    return return_val;
  }
}
----
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::enrich_ip_nums.png[,500]
+
The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the bucket, the routine *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run on each document that contains *ip_start* and *ip_end*.
A new document is created whose data and metadata are based on those of the document on which *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run; but with the addition of *ip_num_start* and *ip_num_end data-fields*, which contain the numeric values returned by *get_numip_first_3_octets*.
The *get_numip_first_3_octets* routine splits the IP address, converts each fragment to a numeral, and adds the numerals together, to form a single value; which it returns.

. Click *Save*.
. To return to the Eventing screen, click *Eventing* and click on the newly created Function name.
The Function *enrich_ip_nums* is listed as a defined Function.
+
image::deploy_enrich_ip_nums.png[,400]

. Click *Deploy*.
. From the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, click *Deploy Function*.
From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
. To check results of the deployed Function, click the *Documents* tab.
. Select *target* bucket from the *Bucket* drop-down.As this shows, a version of *SampleDocument* has been added to the *target* bucket.
It contains all the attributes of the original document, with the addition of *ip_num_start* and *ip_num_end*; which contain the numeric values that correspond to *ip_start* and *ip_end*, respectively.
Additional documents added to the *source* bucket, which share the *ip_start* and *ip_end* attributes, will be similarly handled by the defined Function: creating such a document, and changing any attribute in such a document both cause the Function's execution.
