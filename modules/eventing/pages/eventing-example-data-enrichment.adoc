:description: pass:q[Given a legacy document set containing attributes whose format makes them difficult to search on. In order to correct this search deficiency new searchable attributes will be added to the document.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: {description} These new attributes related to and can be calculated from the original attributes. On any mutation (a document creation or modification) the new attributes should also be created (or updated)

*Implementation*: Implementation: Create JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler. The handler listens for mutations or data-changes within a specified, source bucket. When any document within the bucket is created or modified, the handler executes a user-defined routine. In this example, if the created or altered document contains two specifically named fields containing IP addresses (these respectively corresponding to the beginning and end of an address-range), the handler-routine converts each of the IP addresses to an integer and upserts them as new fields in the document.

** *Case 1*: A new document is created in a specified, target bucket: this new document is identical to the old, except that it has two new additional fields, which contain integers that correspond to the IP addresses. The original document, in the source bucket, is not changed.

** *Case 2*: The original document, in the source bucket, is mutated (or changed) to have two additional fields, which contain integers that correspond to the IP addresses. 

NOTE: As of the 6.5 release, the handler code can directly mutate (or write back) to the source bucket. Case 2 demonstrates this ability.

*Preparations (Common)*

For this example, three buckets 'source', 'target', and 'metadata', are required (note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions). For *Case 1* we will use both 'source and 'target' buckets.  for *Case 2* we will only use the 'source' bucket. Make all three buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

NOTE: The 'metadata' bucket is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from this bucket. In addition do not drop or flush or delete the bucket while you have any deployed Eventing functions.

*Procedure (Case 1)*:

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** You should see no user records.
** Click *Add Document* in the upper right banner
** In the *Add Document* dialog, specify the name *SampleDocument* as the *New Document ID*
** Click *Save*.
** In the *Edit Document* dialog, the following text is displayed:
+
----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** replace the above text with the following JSON document via a cut-n-paste
+
----
{
"country": "AD",
  "ip_start": "5.62.60.1",
  "ip_end": "5.62.60.9"
}
----
** Click *Save*.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *source*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *case_1_enrich_ips* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *On mutation create a new document in a different bucket with additional fields*, in the *Description* text-box.
  ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src* as the "alias name" of the bucket, select *source* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
 *** For the second binding, select "bucket alias", specify *tgt* as the "alias name" of the bucket, select *target* as the associated bucket, and select "read and write".
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::enrichcase1_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *case_1_enrich_ips* dialog appears.
** The *case_1_enrich_ips* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *case_1_enrich_ips code* in this block.
+
image::enrichcase1_02_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *case_1_enrich_ips* dialog.

function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  log('document', doc);
  doc["ip_num_start"] = get_numip_first_3_octets(doc["ip_start"]);

  var return_val = 0;
  if (ip) {
    var parts = ip.split('.');
    //IP Number = A x (256*256*256) + B x (256*256) + C x 256 + D
    return_val = (parts[0]*(256*256*256)) + (parts[1]*(256*256)) + (parts[2]*256) + parseInt(parts[3]);

image::enrichcase1_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the bucket, the routine *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run on each document that contains *ip_start* and *ip_end*. A new document is created whose data and metadata are based on those of the document on which *get_numip_first_3_octets* is run; but with the addition of *ip_num_start* and *ip_num_end data-fields*, which contain the numeric values returned by *get_numip_first_3_octets*. The *get_numip_first_3_octets* routine splits the IP address, converts each fragment to a numeral, and adds the numerals together, to form a single value; which it returns.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything from the Feed boundary* option.
** Starting with version 6.6.2 selecting a Feed Boundary has been deprecated and the Feed Boundary is read from the Function's settings. [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.2#
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and will also more importantly it will also run on subsequent mutations.

. To check the results of the deployed Eventing Function, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *target* bucket.
** Edit the document and you will see a duplicate of the source bucket but without two new calculated fields as follows:
+
----
{
  "country": "AD",
  "ip_end": "5.62.60.9",
  "ip_start": "5.62.60.1",
  "ip_num_start": 87964673,
  "ip_num_end": 87964681
}
----
** Click *Cancel* to close the editor.

. Because our Eventing Function is deployed it will continue to process all new mutations, let's test this out.

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** You should see one user record (the one we entered at the beginning of this procedure).
** Click *Add Document* in the upper right banner
** In the *Add Document* dialog, specify the name *AnotherSampleDocument* as the *New Document ID*
** Click *Save*.
** In the *Edit Document* dialog, the following text is displayed:
+
----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** replace the above text with the following JSON document via a cut-n-paste
+
----
{
  "country": "RU",
  "ip_start": "7.12.60.1",
  "ip_end": "7.62.60.9"
}
----
** Click *Save*.

. To check results (*which were updated in real time*) by the deployed Eventing Function, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *target* bucket.
** Edit the newly created document and you will see a duplicate of the source bucket but without two new calculated fields as follows:
+
----

  "country": "RU",
  "ip_end": "7.62.60.9",
  "ip_start": "7.12.60.1",

  "ip_num_end": 121519113
}
----
** Click *Cancel* to close the editor.


*Procedure (Case 2)*:

. *IMPORTANT* undeploy the Eventing Function (if running) *case_1_enrich_ips*. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and click the function name *case_1_enrich_ips* link of the *source* bucket.
** Click *Undeploy*
** Click *Undeploy Function* to confirm.

. We assume that the two documents from *Case 1* above exist in the 'source' bucket.  If they don't please create them in the 'source' bucket.
** Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** You should see two user records (as previously created above).

*Cleanup (both Case 1 and Case 2)*:

Cleanup, go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function(a) case_1_enrich_ips and case_2_enrich_ips, this will remove the 1024 documents for each function from the 'metadata' bucket (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'metadata' bucket if there are no deployed Eventing functions.
