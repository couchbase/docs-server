= Cascade Delete

*Goal*: This example illustrates how to leverage the Eventing Service to perform a cascade delete operation. When a user is deleted, Couchbase Functions provide a reliable method to delete all the associated documents related to the deleted user.

For this example, three buckets 'users', 'transactions', and 'metadata', are required (note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions). Make all three buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnDelete* handler.
The handler listens to mutations or data-changes within a specified, *users* source bucket.
When a user within the source bucket gets deleted, the handler executes a routine to remove the deleted user.
When the delete operation is complete, all associated documents of the delete user also get removed.

*Procedure*:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *users*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *delete_orphaned_txns* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Delete Orphaned Transactions from the `transactions’ bucket when user_id is greater than or equal to 100*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *source* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
 *** For the binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src_user* as the "alias name" of the bucket, and select *users* as the associated bucket, and select "read only".
 ** After configuring your settings your screen should look like:
+
image::cascadedel_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog appears.
** The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *delete_orphaned_txns code* in this block.
+

** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // debug only shows out mutatoins, we coudl delete this entire OnUpdate() fucntion
    log('OnUpdate NOOP id: ' + meta.id + ' document:',doc);
}
function OnDelete(meta) {
    // Ignore all keys not matching "user_#", allows other types in the source bucket
    if ((meta.id).startsWith("user_") == false) return;
    // implement a contrived filter, keep all user transactions where the user_id > 100
    var id = meta.id;
    var numeric_id = parseInt(id.substring(5));
    if(!isNaN(numeric_id) && numeric_id >= 100) {
       try  {
            DELETE FROM `transactions` WHERE user_id = $numeric_id;
            log('OnDelete: removed orphaned transactions for:', id);
       } catch(e) {
           log('OnDelete: Exception:', e)
       }
    } else {
        log('OnDelete: user_id < 100, kept orphaned transactions for:', id);
    }
}

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::cascadedel_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. The *OnDelete* handler above is triggered for user delete transaction. The handler checks if the *user_id* is greater than or equal to 100 (_the contrived filter never deletes the orphaned transactions form any user with an id of < 100_). When this condition is fulfilled, then an N1QL query is triggered to delete all user related information. The handler also logs if the orphaned transactions wre removed or kept to Function specific application log file.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything from the Feed boundary* option.
** Click *Deploy*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page we will seed some data :
** First create some actual users (5 total)

** Note, the transaction(s) associated with user_id were kept as per our business logic.

. Cleanup, go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *delete_orphaned_txns*, this will remove the 1024 documents from the 'metadata' bucket (in the Bucket view of the UI).  Remember you may only delete the 'metadata' bucket if there are no deployed Eventing functions.
