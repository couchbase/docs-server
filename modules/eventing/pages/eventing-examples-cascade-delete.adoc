= Cascade Delete
:description: pass:q[This example illustrates how to leverage the Eventing Service to perform a cascade delete operation.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: {description}
When a user is deleted, Couchbase Functions provide a reliable method to delete all the associated documents related to the deleted user.

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnDelete* handler.
The handler listens to mutations or data-changes within a specified, *user's* source collection.
When a user within the source collection gets deleted, the Eventing Function executes a JavaScript code to remove the deleted user.
When the delete operation is complete, all associated documents of the delete user also get removed.

This Example uses N1QL unlike the similar scriptlet xref:eventing-handler-cascadeKvDeleteWithDoc.adoc[cascadeKvDeleteWithDoc] which uses just KV or the Data Service.

*Preparations*:

For this example, two (2) buckets *'bulk'* and *'rr100'* are required where the latter is intended to be 100% resident.  
Create the buckets with a minimum size of 100MB. 
For information on buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
Within the buckets we need three (3) keyspaces *'bulk.data.users'*, *'bulk.data.transactions'*, and *'rr100.eventing.metadata'* 
(we loosely follow this xref:eventing-buckets-to-collections.adoc#single-tenancy[organization]).

For the Function Scope or RBAC grouping we will use the *'bulk.data'* assuming you have the role of either "Full Admin" or "Eventing Full Admin". For standard or non-privileged users refer to xref:eventing-roll-based-authentication.adoc[Eventing Role Based Authentication].

_If you run a version of Couchbase prior to 7.0 you can just create the buckets *'users'*, *'transactions'*, and *'metadata'* and run this example.  Furthermore if your cluster was subsequently upgraded from say 6.6.2 to 7.0 your data would be moved to *'users._default._default'*, *'transactions._default._default'*, and *'metadata._default._default'* and your Eventing Function would be seamlessly upgraded to use the new keyspaces and continue to run correctly._

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For complete details on how to set up your keyspaces refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[creating buckets] and 
xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[creating scopes and collections].  

NOTE: The Eventing Storage keyspace, in this case *'rr100.eventing.metadata'*, is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from it.  In addition do not drop or flush or delete the containing bucket (or delete this collection) while you have any deployed Eventing functions. In a single tenancy deployment this collection can be shared with other Eventing functions.

*Procedure*:

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Function Scope* drop-down, select *'bulk.data'* as the RBAC grouping.
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-down, select *bulk*, *data*, *users* as the keyspace.
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-down, select *rr100*, *eventing*, *metadata* as the keyspace.
 ** Enter *delete_orphaned_txns* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** Leave the "Deployment Feed Boundary" as Everything.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Delete Orphaned Transactions from the `bulk`.`data`.`transactions` collection when user_id is greater than or equal to 100*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add one bindings.
 *** For the binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src_user* as the "alias name" of the collection, 
 select *bulk*, *data*, *users* as the associated keyspace, and select "read only" for the access mode. *Note we will not be using this binding as we have no need of it because we will use N1QL.*
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::cascadedel_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog appears.
** The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *delete_orphaned_txns code* in this block.
+
image::cascadedel_02_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // debug only shows out mutations, we could delete this entire OnUpdate() function
    log('OnUpdate NOOP id: ' + meta.id + ' document:',doc);
}
function OnDelete(meta) {
    // Ignore all keys not matching "user_#", allows other types in the source collection
    if ((meta.id).startsWith("user_") == false) return;
    // implement a contrived filter, keep all user transactions where the user_id > 100
    var id = meta.id;
    var numeric_id = parseInt(id.substring(5));
    if(!isNaN(numeric_id) && numeric_id >= 100) {
       try  {
            DELETE FROM bulk.data.transactions WHERE user_id = $numeric_id;
            log('OnDelete: removed orphaned transactions for:', id);
       } catch(e) {
           log('OnDelete: Exception:', e)
       }
    } else {
        log('OnDelete: user_id < 100, kept orphaned transactions for:', id);
    }
}
----
+
Note, the N1QL keyspace of *bulk.data.transactions* in earlier releases would be simply the bucket *transactions*.
+
After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::cascadedel_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save and Return*.

. The *OnDelete* handler above is triggered for user delete mutation. The handler checks if the *user_id* is greater than or equal to 100 (_this contrived filter never deletes the orphaned transactions from any user with an id of < 100_). When this condition is fulfilled, then an N1QL query is triggered to delete all user related information. The handler also logs if the orphaned transactions were removed or kept to Function specific application log file (refer to the log(...) statements in the above JavaScript).

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *delete_orphaned_txns* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.
+
image::cascadedel_03a_deploy.png[,100%]
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Query* page we will seed some data :
** First create some actual users (5 total)

** Note, the transaction(s) associated with user_id *"user_50"* were kept as per our business logic.

*Cleanup*:

Go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *delete_orphaned_txns*, this will remove the 1024 documents for the function from the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' collection (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' keyspace if there are no deployed Eventing Functions.

Now flush the 'bulk' bucket if you plan to run other examples (you may need to Edit the bucket 'bulk' and enable the flush capability).
