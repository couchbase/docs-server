= Function: Basic Bucket Ops
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: Perform the basic bucket operations where Eventing interacts with the Data service.

* This function *basicBucketOps* merely demonstrates basic Evening BucketOps.
* Requires a metadata bucket, a source bucket, and a bucket called "destination".
* Needs a Binding of type Bucket Alias (as documented in the Scriptlet).
* Will operate on any mutation where doc.type === "basic_bkt_ops".
* The final document is deleted, as such the output is the Application log file.
* For more detail refer to xref:eventing-language-constructs.adoc#bucket_accessors[Bucket Accessors]

// To run need a Binding in this Function's Settings as follows:

// 4. read+write
