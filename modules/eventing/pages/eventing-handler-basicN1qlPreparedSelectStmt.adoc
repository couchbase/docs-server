= Function: Basic N1QL Prepared Select Statment
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: Iterate through a basic N1QL SELECT where Eventing interacts with the Data service via a prepared N1QL statement.

* This function *basicN1qlPreparedSelectStmt* demonstrates how use a prepared N1QL SELECT statement with a passed parameter. 
* Typically, this is done for greater performance, the cluster will typically not prepare a statement if it is already prepared.
* We have just one positional parameter $1 for "doc.iata", if we had a second parameter we would use the placeholder $2, and so on.
* Requires the "travel-sample" sample dataset to be loaded.
* Requires a metadata bucket, a source bucket of "travel-sample".
* Deploy the Function with a Feed Boundary "From now" (Note you will log 187 lines if you use "Everything").
* Assuming you deployed "From now" mutate any document in "travel-sample" to generate a log line.
* For more detail refer to xref:eventing-language-constructs.adoc#added-lang-features[N1QL Statements].
