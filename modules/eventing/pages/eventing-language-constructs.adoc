= Language Constructs

[abstract]
The Eventing service is implemented in JavaScript.
Some constructs have been removed, others added.

== Language Constructs Overview

The Eventing service is implemented in JavaScript.
In general, functions inherit support for most ECMAScript constructs by using Google v8 as the execution container.
However, to support the ability to shard and scale function-execution automatically, some capabilities have been removed.
Additionally, to optimize language-utilization of the server environment, some new constructs have been added.

== Removed Language Features

The following JavaScript features have been removed.

* _Global State_: Functions do not allow global variables.
All state must be saved and retrieved from persistence providers.
In Couchbase Server 5.5, the only available persistence provider is the KV provider: therefore, all global state is contained in the KV bucket(s) made available to the function via bindings.
This restriction is necessary in order to enable function-logic to remain agnostic of rebalance.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var count = 0;                         // Not allowed - global variable.
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  count++;
}
----

* _Asynchrony_: Asynchrony — and in particular, asynchronous callback  — can and often must retain access to parent scope to be useful.
This forms a node-specific, long-running state that prevents the capture of entire long-running state in persistence providers.
Therefore, function handlers are restricted to running as short-running, straight-line code, without sleeps and wakeups.
Limited asynchrony is added back via time observers (these are designed, however, not to make the state node-specific).
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  setTimeout(function(){}, 300);     // Not allowed - asynchronous flow.
}
----

* _Browser and other Extensions_: As functions do not execute in context of a browser, the extensions browsers add to the core language, such as window methods and DOM events, are not available.
A limited subset is added back (such as Function Timers in lieu of setTimeout, and curl calls instead of XHR).
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  var rpc = window.XMLHttpRequest();  // Not allowed - browser extension.
}
----

== Added Language Features

The following constructs have been added.

* _Bucket Accessors_: Couchbase buckets, when bound to a function, appear as a global JavaScript map.
Map get, set and delete are mapped to KV get, set, and delete respectively.
Other advanced KV operations are available as member functions on the map object.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  // Assuming 'dest' is a bucket alias binding
  var val = dest[meta.id];         // this is a bucket GET operation.
  dest[meta.id] = {"status":3};    // this is a bucket SET operation.
  delete dest[meta.id];            // this is a bucket DEL operation.
}
----

* _N1QL_: Top level N1QL keywords, such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `INSERT`, are available as keywords in functions.
Operations that return values are accessible through a special iterator on which the `for (var <row> of <iterator>)` looping-construct has been defined.
This restricted looping-construct allows support of query-result streaming, and automatic query-cancellation when the iterator goes out of scope.
Any variable that is reachable from the scope of the N1QL query can be referred to using `$<variable>` syntax in the N1QL statement, where parameters will be substituted according to the rules of named-parameter substitution in the N1QL grammar specification.
+
IMPORTANT: The N1QL construct is still in development and may have some rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release.
This Beta-release version of Couchbase Server 5.5 is intended for development purposes only.
+
The iterator is an input iterator (elements are read-only).
The keyword `this` cannot be used in the body of the iterator.
The variables created inside the iterator are local to the iterator.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  var strong = 70;
  var stmt =
    SELECT *                  // N1QL queries are embedded directly.
    FROM `beer-samples`       // Token escaping is standard N1QL style.
    WHERE abv > $strong;      // Local variable reference using $ syntax.
  for (var beer of stmt) {  // Stream results using 'for' iterator.
    break;                   // Cancel streaming query by breaking out.
  }
}
----

* _Timers_: Functions can register to observe wall-clock time-events.
Such events can occur either standalone, or in reference to a specific document.
Timers are sharded across eventing nodes, and so are scalable.
For this reason, there is no guarantee either that a timer will fire on the same node on which it was registered, or that ordering between any two timers will be maintained.
Timers only guarantee to fire at or after the specified time.
Timers allow an opaque value to be provided, which is made available to the callback when the timer fires.
Opaque values are serialized and deserialized, and hence are passed by value, and must be smaller than system-defined limits.
+
IMPORTANT: The Timers construct is still in development and may have some rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release.
This Beta-release version of Couchbase Server 5.5 is intended for development purposes only.
 ** _Cron Timers_: Cron timers allow a function-handler to be called at a specific time.
The opaque value stored when the timer is created forms the context for the timer-callback.
Epoch time, is the time at which the callback function gets invoked.
Epoch time is usally specified in seconds.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function checkProblems(ctx) {
     var res = SELECT * from inventory WHERE type = ctx.type;
     for (var item of res) {
       if (item.stock < 0) {
        log("Invalid stock status for " + item);
     }
 }

function OnUpdate(item, meta) {
      if (item.stock < 0) {
        var time = Math.round((new Date()).getTime() / 1000) + 60;
        cronTimer(checkProblems, {"type": item.type}, time);
      }
 }
----

 ** _Doc Timers_: A doc timer is similar to a cron timer, except that the timer is associated with a document.
Hence, doc timers follow the lifecycle of the document, including rollbacks.
Doc timer callbacks receive the document key.
Epoch time, is the time at which the callback function gets invoked.
Epoch time is usally specified in seconds.
+
[source,javascript]
----
 function monitorRefill(key) {
     var item = orders[key];
     if (item.stock == 0) {
       log("Possible refill problem for " + item)
     }
 }

function OnUpdate(item, meta) {
    if (item.stock == 0) {
       var time = Math.round((new Date()).getTime() / 1000) + 24 * 60 * 60;
       docTimer(monitorRefill, meta.id, time);
    }
}
----

== Handler Signatures

The Eventing service makes the following event-handlers available.

* _Insert/Update Handler_: Gets called when a document is created or modified.
The following limitations exist:
 ** If a document is modified several times in a short duration, the calls may be coalesced into a single event, due to deduplication.
 ** It is not possible to distinguish Create from Update operations.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {

  if (doc.type === 'order' && doc.value > 5000) {

    //‘phonverify’ is a bucket alias that is specified as a binding.

    phoneverify[meta.id] = doc.customer;
  }
}
----

* _Delete Handler_: Gets called when a document is deleted.
The following limitations exist:
 ** It is not possible to distinguish Expiration from Delete operations.
 ** It is not possible to get the value of the document that either was just deleted or expired.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnDelete(meta) {
  var stmt = SELECT id from orders WHERE shipaddr = $meta.id;
    for (var id of stmt) {
      log("Address invalidated for pending order: " + id);
  }
  }
