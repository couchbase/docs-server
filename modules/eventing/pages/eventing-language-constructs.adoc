= Language Constructs
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
The language constructs are fundamental units of a language.
This topic discusses the JavaScript constructs that have been removed and new constructs that have been added in order to support the requirements of Couchbase Functions.

Using JavaScript, you can write your custom Functions.
Couchbase Functions inherit support for most ECMAScript constructs by using Google v8 as the execution container.
However, to support the ability to shard and scale Function-execution automatically, some capabilities have been removed.
Additionally, to optimize language-utilization of the server environment, some new constructs have been added.

NOTE: While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of the content of the Eventing documentation herein, it should be noted that the controlling technical document is the https://github.com/couchbase/eventing/blob/master/docs/specification-66.pdf[Couchbase 6.6 Eventing Specification] available on GitHub.

[#removed-lang-features]
== Removed Language Features

The following JavaScript features have been removed and cannot be used in handlers:

* <<global_state,Global State>>
* <<asynchrony,Asynchrony>>
* <<browser_extensions,Browser and other Extensions>>

[#global_state]
=== Global State

Function handlers do not allow global variables. All state must be saved and retrieved from persistence providers. In Couchbase Server, the Data Service provider is used as a persistence provider. Therefore, all global states are contained in the Data Service bucket(s) made available to the Function handlers through bindings. This restriction is mandatory for the Function's handler logic to remain agnostic of the rebalance operation.

[source,javascript]
----
var count = 0;                         // Not allowed - global variable.
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  count++;
}
----

[#asynchrony]
=== Asynchrony

Asynchrony, particularly asynchronous callbacks, to be useful needs to retain access to their parent scope. As such asynchrony forms a node specific, long-running state that prevents the capture of the entire state in the persistence providers. Therefore, Function handlers are restricted to executing as short-running, straight-line code, without sleep and wakeups. Limited asynchrony is added back through time observers. Time observers are designed specifically not to make the state node specific.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  setTimeout(function(){}, 300);     // Not allowed - asynchronous flow.
}
----

[#browser_extensions]
=== Browser and other Extensions

Function handlers execute as server-side code on Couchbase Server similar to the JavaScript code that is used in browsers.

Because handlers do not execute in the context of a browser, the extensions that browsers add to the core language, such as window methods, DOM events etc. are not available. The Couchbase Server prevents these browser extensions from executing in a handler.  However a limited subset is added back (such as function timers in lieu of setTimeout, and curl calls in lieu of XHR).

For example that the code displayed in the below example runs in the browser. The ‘window’ term in the code *window.XMLHttpRequest()*, is not a server-side construct but is in the context of a browser and as such is not available to your Function handlers.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  var rpc = window.XMLHttpRequest();  // Not allowed - browser extension.
}
----

[#added-lang-features]
== Added Language Features

The following constructs have been added:

* <<bucket_accessors,Bucket Accessors>>
* <<advanced_bucket_accessors,Advanced Bucket Accessors>>
* <<logging,Logging>>
* <<n1ql_statements,N1QL Statements>>

[#bucket_accessors]
=== Bucket Accessors

Couchbase buckets, when bound to a Function, appear as a global JavaScript map.
The map operations such as get, set and delete are exposed to the Data Service providers get, set, and delete operations respectively.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  // Assuming 'dest' is a bucket alias binding
  var val = dest[meta.id];         // this is a bucket GET operation.
  dest[meta.id] = {"status":3};    // this is a bucket SET operation.
  delete dest[meta.id];            // this is a bucket DEL operation.
}
----

* *The GET operation* _(operator [] applied on a bucket binding and used as a value expression)_
+
This fetches the corresponding object from the KV bucket the variable is bound to, and returns the parsed JSON value as a JavaScript object. Fetching a non-existent object from a bucket will return JavaScript undefined value. This operation throws an exception if the underlying bucket GET operation fails with an unexpected error.

* *The SET operation* _(operator [] appearing on left of = assignment statement)_
+
This sets the provided JavaScript value into the KV bucket the variable is bound to, replacing any existing value with the specified key. This operation throws an exception if the underlying bucket SET operation fails with an unexpected error.

* *The DELETE operation* _(operator [] appearing after JavaScript delete keyword)_
+
This deletes the provided key from the KV bucket the variable is bound to. If the object does not exist, this call is treated as a no-op. This operation throws an exception if the underlying bucket DELETE operation fails with an unexpected error.


//****
//[.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.1#

[#advanced_bucket_accessors]
=== Advanced Bucket Accessors [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.1#

The following advanced bucket accessors have been added:

* <<advanced_get_op,The Advanced GET operation>>
* <<advanced_insert_op,The Advanced INSERT operation>>
* <<advanced_upsert_op,The Advanced UPSERT operation>>
* <<advanced_replace_op,The Advanced REPLACE operation>>
* <<advanced_delete_op,The Advanced DELETE operation>>
* <<advanced_increment_op,The Advanced INCREMENT operation>>
* <<advanced_decrement_op,The Advanced DECREMENT operation>>

These new accessors make it possible to access advanced KV functionality using the following built-in operators. They utilize the same bucket bindings defined in the handler, but exposer a richer set of options and operators.

[#advanced_get_op]
* *The Advanced GET operation*: _result = couchbase.get(binding, meta)_
+
This operation allows reading a document from the bucket with an ability to specify the CAS value to be matched during the read.
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    log('input meta', meta);
    log('input doc ', doc);
    // could be the same or different
    var new_meta = {"id":"key::1"}; 
    var result = couchbase.get(src_bkt,new_meta);
    if (result.success) {
        log('success adv. get meta',result);
    } else {
        log('id',new_meta.id,'adv. get failed',result)

[#logging]
=== Logging

An additional function, log() has been introduced to the language, which allows handlers to log user defined messages. These messages go into the eventing data directory and do not contain any system log messages. The function takes a string to write to the file. If non-string types are passed, a best effort string representation will be logged, but the format of these may change over time. This function does not throw exceptions.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  log("Now processing: " + meta.id);
}
----

[#n1ql_statements]
=== N1QL Statements

Top level N1QL keywords, such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE, are available as inline keywords in handlers. Operations that return values such as SELECT are accessible through a returned Iterable handle. N1QL Query results, via a SELECT, are streamed in batches to the Iterable handle as the iteration progresses through the result set.

NOTE: N1QL DML statements cannot manipulate documents in the same bucket as the handler is listening for mutations on to avoid recursion. Workaround: use the exposed data service KV map in your Eventing function.

JavaScript variables can be referred by N1QL statements using *$<variable>* syntax. Such parameters will be substituted with the corresponding JavaScript variable's runtime value using N1QL named parameters substitution facility.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    var strong = 70;
    var results =
        SELECT *                  /* N1QL queries are embedded directly.    */
        FROM `beer-sample`        /* Token escaping is standard N1QL style. */
        WHERE abv > $strong;      // Local variable reference using $ syntax.
    for (var beer of results) {   // Stream results using 'for' iterator.
        log(beer);
        break;
    }
    results.close();              // End the query and free resources held
}
----

The call starts the query and returns a JavaScript Iterable object representing the result set of the query. The query is streamed in batches as the iteration proceeds. The returned handle can be iterated using any standard JavaScript mechanism including _for...of_ loops.

In multiline N1QL statements (as above) you cannot use single line [.var]`// end of line comments like this` +
prior to the terminating semicolon as it will cause a syntax error in the transpilation of the N1QL statement, however multiline [.var]`/* comments like this */` are allowed.

The iterator is an input iterator (elements are read-only). The keyword _this_ cannot be used in the body of the iterator. The variables created inside the iterator are local to the iterator.

The returned handle must be closed using the [.var]`close()` method defined on it, which stops the underlying N1QL query and releases associated resources.

NOTE: When a handler completes for a given mutation and exits all resources will be freed even if you omit the [.var]`close()` statement for your result set(s). However in some complex use cases such as nested N1QL lookups a failure to explicitly call [.var]`close()` after each result set is no longer needed can tie up an excessive amount of N1QL resources and lead to poor performance.

All three operations, i.e., the N1QL statement, iterating over the result set, and closing the Iterable handle can throw exceptions if unexpected error arises from the underlying N1QL query.

As N1QL is not syntactically part of the JavaScript language, the handler code is transpiled to identify valid N1QL statements which are then converted to a standard JavaScript function call that returns an Iterable object with addition of a [.var]`close()` method.

You must use [.var]`$<variable>`, as per N1QL specification, to use a JavaScript variable in the query statement.
The object expressions for substitution are not supported and therefore you cannot use the [.param]`meta.id` expression in the query statement.

Instead of [.param]`meta.id` expression, you can use `var id = meta.id` in an N1QL query.

* Invalid N1QL Statement
+
[source, N1QL]
----
DELETE FROM `transactions` WHERE username = $meta.id;
----

* Valid N1QL Statement
+
[source, N1QL]
----
var id = meta.id;
DELETE FROM `transactions` WHERE username = $id;
----

When you use a N1QL query inside a Function handler, remember to use an escaped identifier for bucket names with special characters
(+++`+++[.param]`bucket-name`+++`+++).
Escaped identifiers are surrounded by backticks and support all identifiers in JSON

For example:

* If the bucket name is [.param]`beer-sample`, then use the N1QL query such as:
+
[source, N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM `beer-sample` WHERE type...
----

* If bucket name is [.param]`beersample`, then use the N1QL query such as:
+
[source, N1QL]
----
SELECT * FROM beersample WHERE type ...
----

[#build-in-functions]
== Built-in Functions

The following built in functions have been added:

* <<n1ql_call,The N1QL() function call>>
* <<crc64_call,The crc64() function call>>


[#n1ql_call]
=== The N1QL() Function Call

The _N1QL()_ function call  is documented below for reference purposes but should not used directly as doing so would bypass the various semantic and syntactic checks of the transpiler (notably: recursive mutation checks will no longer function, and the statement will need to manual escaping of all N1QL special sequences and keywords).

NOTE: In addition the _N1qlQuery()_ is now deprecated and has been replaced with the _N1QL()_ call which has a different parameter format.

* _statement_
+
This is the identified N1QL statement. This will be passed to N1QL via SDK to run as a prepared statement. All referenced JS variables in the statement (using the $var notation) will be treated by N1QL as named parameters.

* _params_
+
This can be either a JavaScript array (for positional parameters) or a JavaScript map. When the N1QL statement utilizes positional parameters (i.e., $1, $2 ...), then params is expected to be a JavaScript array corresponding to the values to be bound to these positional parameters. When the N1QL statement utilizes named parameters (i.e., $name), then params is expected to be a JavaScript map object providing the name-value pairs corresponding to the variables used by the N1QL statement. Positional and named value parameters cannot be mixed.
+
_iterator using a positional params array_
+
[source,javascript]
----
    // Using `travel-sample` demonstrate positional params.
    // a) Positional param 1 is field 'iata' from the input doc
    // b) Positional param 2 from a Handler variable: max_dist
    // c) Will also prepare the statement for better performance
    
    var max_dist = 120;
    var results = N1QL(
        "SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt " +
        "FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = \"route\" " +
        "AND airline = $1 AND distance <= $2",
        [doc.iata,max_dist], 
        { 'isPrepared': true }
    );
----
+
_iterator using a named params object_
+
[source,javascript]
----
    // Using `travel-sample` demonstrate named params.
    // a) Named param 1 '$mytype' is a hardcode
    // b) Named param 2 '$myairline' is field 'iata' from the input doc
    // c) Named param 3 '$mydistance' if from a Handler variable max_dist
    // d) Set the consistancy in the options to none
    
    var max_dist = 120;
    var results = N1QL("SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt " +
        "FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = $mytype " +
        "AND airline = $myairline AND distance <= $mydistance",
        { '$mytype': 'route', '$mydistance': max_dist, '$myairline': doc.iata },         
        { 'consistency': 'none' }
    );
----

* _options_
+
This is a JSON object having various query runtime options as keys. Currently, the following settings are recognized:

** _isPrepared_
+
This controls if the statement will be prepared. Normally, this defaults to _false_ but can be set on a per statement basis to _true_ for any N1QL query that needs increased performance.

** _consistency_
+
This controls the consistency level for the statement. Normally, this defaults to the consistency level specified in the overall handler settings but can be set on a per statement basis. The valid values are "none" and "request".

* _return value (handle)_
+
The call returns a JavaScript Iterable object representing the result set of the query. The query is streamed in batches as the iteration proceeds. The returned handle can be iterated using any standard JavaScript mechanism including for...of loops.

** _close() Method on handle object (return value)_
+
This releases the resources held by the N1QL query. If the query is still streaming results, the query is cancelled.

* _Exceptions Thrown_
+
The N1QL() function throws an exception if the underlying N1QL query fails to parse or start executing. The returned Iterable handler throws an exception if the underlying N1QL query fails after starting. The close() method on the iterable handle can throw an exception if underlying N1QL query cancellation encounters an unexpected error.


[#crc64_call]
=== The crc64() Function Call

_crc64()_: This function calculates the CRC64 hash of an object using the ISO polynomial. The function
takes one parameter, the object to checksum, and this can be any JavaScript object that can be
encoded to JSON. The hash is returned as a string (because JavaScript numeric types offers only
53-bit precision). Note that the hash is sensitive to ordering of parameters in case of map
objects.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    var crc_str = crc64(doc);
    /// code here ...
}
----

The *crc64* function can be useful in cases like suppressing a duplicate mutation from the Sync Gateway (SG), when both the Sync Gateway & Eventing are leveraging the same bucket. Basically, Sync Gateway updates metadata of the document within the bucket, which in turn generates an event for Eventing to process. Eventing can't differentiate between events from Sync Gateway and other events (doc updates via SDK, N1QL, and others).  A workaround to this double mutation issue is possible via the *crc64()* function.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // Ignore documents created by Sync Gateway
    if(meta.id.startsWith("_sync") == true) return;

    // Ignore documents whose body has not changed since we last saw it
    var prev_crc = checksum_bucket[meta.id];
    var curr_crc = crc64(doc);
    if (prev_crc === curr_crc) return;
    checksum_bucket[meta.id] = curr_crc;

   // Business logic goes in here
}
----
Note that if multiple Eventing functions (or handlers) share the same Sync Gateway crc64() checksum documents, real mutations will be suppressed and missed. In this use case make the checksum documents unique to each handler, i.e. checksum_bucket["handler1:" + meta.id], checksum_bucket["handler2:" + meta.id], etc.

[#handler-signatures]
== Handler Signatures

Eventing Service or framework calls the following JavaScript functions as entry points to the handler.

* <<onupdate_handler,OnUpdate Handler>>
* <<ondelete_handler,OnDelete Handler>>

[#onupdate_handler]
=== OnUpdate Handler

This handler gets called when a document is created or modified, e.g. Insert/Update. The handler listens to mutations (the creation or modification of documents) in the associated source Bucket.

In this handler the following limitations exist, both limitations arise due to KV engine design choices and may be revisited in the future:

* If a document is modified several times in a short duration, the calls may be coalesced into a single event due to deduplication.
* It is not possible to distinguish between a Create and an Update operation.

A sample OnUpdate handler is displayed below:

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  if (doc.type === 'order' && doc.value > 5000) {
    // ‘phonverify’ is a bucket alias that is specified as a Bucket binding.
    phoneverify[meta.id] = doc.customer;
  }
}
----


[#ondelete_handler]
=== OnDelete Handler

This handler gets called when a document is deleted or removed due to an expiry.
The handler listens to mutations (deletions or expirations) in the associated source Bucket.  As of release 6.6.0 it is now possible to determine if the document was deleted or expired. This is accomplished via the optional argument "options" -- a JavaScript map object with a boolean entry named 'expired'.

In this handler the following limitation exists. This limitation arises due to KV engine design choices and may be revisited in the future:

* It is not possible to distinguish if the document was removed is a Delete operation or removed as a result of a document expiration.

A sample OnDelete handler is displayed below:

[source,javascript]
----
function OnDelete(meta,options) {
    if (options.expired) log("Document expired", meta.id);
    var addr = meta.id;
    var res = SELECT id from orders WHERE shipaddr = $addr;
    for (var id of res) {
        log("Address invalidated for pending order: " + id);
    }
}
----

Note that the pre-6.6.0 argument syntax is still fully supported, but you will not be able to differentiate deletion from expiration.

[source,javascript]
----
function OnDelete(meta) {
    log("Document deleted or expired", meta.id);
}
----

== Reserved Words

Reserved words are words that cannot be used in a handler as a variable name, function name, or as a property in the Function handler code. The following table lists the reserved words that you must refrain from using as they are used by the transpiler to integrate Couchbase's query language, N1QL with Eventing.

*What Happens If You Use a Reserved Word?*

Let's say you try to create a new Function handler code using a reserved word for variable names, for function names, and as a property bindings value. All three cases generate a deployment error.

Reserved words as a variable name:

[source,javascript]
----
function get_numip_first_3_octets(ip) {
    var grant = 0;
    if (ip) {
        var parts = ip.split('.');
    }
}
----

Reserved words as a function name:

[source,javascript]
----
function grant(ip) {
    var return_val = 0;
    if (ip) {
        var parts = ip.split('.');
    }
}
----

During the Function deployment step, when the system validates the handler code, it displays an error message such as the following:
+
[.out]`Sample Error Message - Deployment failed: Syntax error (<line and column numbers>) - grant is a reserved name in N1QLJs`

Reserved words as a property bindings value
