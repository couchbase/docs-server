= Adding a Couchbase Function
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
To add a new Function, proceed as follows:

[#eventing_examples_preparations]
. From the Couchbase Web Console > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*.
. An empty *ADD FUNCTION* dialog with defaults is shown below:

. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements allows the developer to provide the below information:

| *Elements* | *Description*

| Source Bucket
| The name of a bucket currently defined on the cluster.

For more information on creating buckets, refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

| Metadata Bucket
| The name of a bucket currently defined on the cluster.
This bucket stores artifacts and checkpoint information.

| Function Name
| A name, for the Function you are creating.

| Description
| A description of the Function you are creating.
This is optional.

| Settings

The available settings are:

* *Log Level:* The granularity at which messages are logged.
The options (available from the arrows control at the right of the field) are Info, Error, Warning, Debug, (the default), and Trace.
This logging attribute is function-specific and is not applicable for the Eventing Service in general.
* *N1QL Consistency:* The default consistency level of N1QL statements in the handler either None (the Default) or Request.
The default is 3 (the minimum is 1 maximum is 64).
* *Workers:* The number of worker threads to be allocated to the Function.
The default is 3 (the minimum is 1 maximum is 64).
* *Language compatibility:* The language version of the handler for backward compatibility either 6.0.0 or 6.5.0. Primarily to allow older handlers to continue to see the runtime behavior that existed at the time they were authored
* *Script Timeout:* The number of seconds that should elapse before the script times out and is terminated.
The default is 60.

| Bindings
| A binding is a construct that allows separating environment specific variables (example: bucket names, external endpoint URLs, credentials) from the handler source code.  Currently Eventing Functions support either *Bucket Bindings* (to access KV data) or *URL Bindings* to communicate externally via cURL. An Eventing Function can have no binding, one binding, or several bindings.

For more information on Bindings, refer to xref:eventing-Terminologies.adoc#section_mzd_l1p_m2b[Bindings].

. *Prerequisites*: In order to show the basic life cycle of adding an Eventing Function we need a 'source' bucket and a metadata *metadata*. You must have a bucket typically called *metadata* used solely by Eventing if it is misisng create it with a minimum size of 100MB.  For the source bucket we will use 'travel-sample' sample document set. 
+
If you donâ€™t already have the sample bucket *beer-sample* listed in the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page you can load this document set as follows:

** Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Settings* page
** Select the *Sample Buckets* in the upper right banner. 
** Check *beer-sample* checkbox.
** Click *Load Sample Data*.

. To get to the next screen *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, as follows:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *beer-sample*.  
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *my_evt_function* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *A simple Eventing Function only prints IDs*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, don't add any bindings (we will merely be logging messages).
+

. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *delete_orphaned_txns* dialog appears.
** The *my_evt_function* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will accept the default for your *my_evt_function code*.
+
image::addfunc_03_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. Click on the Function name.

Additional controls are now displayed, the controls are:
 ** *Delete*: Deletes the Eventing Function from the system.
 ** *Export*: Exports the EventingFunction as a JSON document.
 ** *Deploy*: Deploys the EventingFunction, making it active across the cluster.
 ** *Pausey*: Pauses the EventingFunction, making it active across the cluster (only allowed if Deployed).
 ** *Edit JavaScript*: Allows edits to be made on the Eventing Function, in an edit dialog (only allowed when Paused or Undeployed).

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything from the Feed boundary* option.
+
The Feed Boundary determines whether documents previously in existence needs to be included in the Function's activities: the options are *Everything* and *From now*. The *Everything* option invokes a Function on all mutations available in the cluster The *From now* option invokes a Function during future instances of data mutation, post Function deployment.
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.
+
This simple example is listing to the bucket 'beer-sample' which has 7,303 documents.  The only thing the function does is print the ID of each document.

. Once the Eventing Function is fully deployed it's status will change form *deploying...* to a status of *deployed* 

. Verify actually worked by clicking the *Log* link that appeared after you deployed the Eventing Function in the right hand side of the screen.
** A dialog showing the *Function Log - my_evt_function* will appear with the most recent logging information (in reverse order with the most recent lines first).
+
image::addfunc_05_logs_emitted.png[,700]
** Click *Close*

. To pause and resume a function (you can then edit and update the function without missing a mutation)  
** Click *Pause* 
** In the *Confirm Pause Function* dialog
*** Click *Pause Function*.
** The Eventing function will now pause.
** Wait for the "paused" state.
** Click *Resume* 
** In the *Confirm Resume Function* dialog
*** Click *Resume Function*.
** The Eventing function will now resume.

. To remove the Eventing Function *my_evt_function*  
** Click *Undeploy* 
** In the *Confirm Undeploy Function* dialog
*** Click *Undeploy Function*.
** The Eventing function will now undeploy.
** Wait for the "undeployed" state.
** Click *Delete* 
** In the *Confirm Delete Function* dialog
*** Click *Delete Function*.

NOTE: The Eventing Function lifecycle operations (deploying, undeploying, pausing, resuming, and deleting operations) and the Eventing rebalance operation *are mutually exclusive*. The Eventing rebalance operation fails when an Eventing Function lifecycle operation is currently in progress. Likewise, when the Eventing rebalance operation is in progress, you cannot perform an Eventing Function lifecycle operation.
