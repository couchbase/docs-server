= Eventing REST API
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
The Eventing REST API, available by default at port 8096, provides the methods available to work with Couchbase Eventing Functions.

NOTE: The Eventing Functions REST API endpoints on this page are supported, as long as the content of the handler body is not created or modified externally (as the internal format of the body is not yet standardized).
