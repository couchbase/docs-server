| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/[function_name]/settings_
a| 
Updates an undeployed a Function with the provided setting. Do not update settings for a deployed or paused function.
Note you must always specify deployment_status (deplyed/undeployed) and processing_status (paused/not-paused) when using this REST endpoint to opdate any option(s).

Sample API (alter worker_count):

----
curl -XPOST -d '{"deployment_status":false,"processing_status":false,"worker_count":6}'
