= Eventing REST API
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

[abstract]
The Eventing REST API, available by default at port 8096, provides the methods available to work with Couchbase Eventing Functions.

NOTE: The Eventing Functions REST API endpoints on this page are supported, as long as the content of the handler body is not created or modified externally (as the internal format of the body is not yet standardized).

.Eventing Functions API
[cols="2,3,6"]
|===
| HTTP Method | *URI Path* | *Description*

| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/[function_name]_
| Import or create a single Function.
The Function name in the body must match that on the URL.
Function definition includes current settings.

| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/_
| Imports or creates multiple Functions.
Function names must be unique.
When multiple Functions have the same name, an error is reported.

| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/import/_
| Imports multiple Functions.
Function names must be unique.
When multiple Functions have the same name, an error is reported. Note if any Function's language_compatibility field is missing the value will be set to 6.0.0 (unlike the [.path]_/api/v1/functions_ above which will set the value to the highest version supported by the server).

| GET
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions_
| View a list of Functions.
Provides a list of Functions available in the cluster.
The list includes both the deployed and the undeployed Functions.

| DELETE
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/[function_name]_
| Deletes a specific Functions from the cluster.

| DELETE
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions_
| Deletes multiple Functions from the cluster.

| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/[function_name]/settings_
| Edit Function settings.
During an edit, settings provided are merged.
Unspecified attributes retain their prior values.

| POST
| [.path]_/api/v1/config_
| Modify global configuration.
During an edit, settings provided are merged.
