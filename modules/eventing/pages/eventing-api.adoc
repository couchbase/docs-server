= Functions API

[abstract]
Methods made available by Functions.

== Create a Function

[source,bourne]
----
POST /api/v1/functions/<name>
----

The function _name_ in the body must match that on the URL.
Function definition includes current settings.

Multiple functions cannot have the same name.
An error is reported in such cases.

== Create Multiple Functions

[source,bourne]
----
POST /api/v1/functions/
----

Multiple functions cannot have the same name.
An error is reported in such cases.

== Get a Function

[source,bourne]
----
GET /api/v1/functions/<name>
----

Function definition includes its settings.

== Get All Functions

[source,bourne]
----
GET /api/v1/functions
----

== Delete a Function

[source,bourne]
----
DELETE /api/v1/functions/<name>
----

== Delete All Functions

[source,bourne]
----
DELETE /api/v1/functions
----

== Manipulate a Function's Settings

[source,bourne]
----
GET /api/v1/functions/<name>/settings
----

== Modify a Function's Settings

[source,bourne]
----
POST /api/v1/functions/<name>/settings
----

Settings provided are merged, and so unspecified elements retain their prior values.

== Get the Eventing Global Configuration

[source,bourne]
----
GET /api/v1/config
----

== Manipulate the Eventing Global Configuration

[source,bourne]
----
POST /api/v1/config
----

Configuration provided is merged, and so unspecified elements retain their prior values.

The response indicates whether the Eventing service must be restarted for the submitted changes to take effect.

All available settings, with the default and a description for each, are provided in the table below.
