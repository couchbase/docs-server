= Eventing REST API
:description:  The Eventing REST API, available by default at port 8096, provides the methods available to work with and manipulate Couchbase Eventing Functions.

[abstract]
{description}

NOTE: Changes to the Eventing Function definition files made outside of this REST API or the interactive UI are only supported for version 7.0 (and above) if the Eventing schemas located in https://github.com/couchbase/eventing/tree/master/parser are adhered to.

| [.path]_/api/v1/functions/[function_name]/settings_
a| 
Updates an undeployed or paused function with the provided setting. 
Note settings can only be altered when the function is paused or undeployed, attempting to adjust a deployed function will result in an error. 
During an edit, settings provided are merged. Unspecified attributes retain their prior values.
Note that you must always specify *deployment_status* (deployed/undeployed) and *processing_status* (paused/not-paused) when using this REST endpoint to update any option or set of options.

The current values of *deployment_status* and *processing_status* can be queried via _api/v1/status_ or _api/v1/status/[sample_name]_  

By adjusting *deployment_status* and *processing_status* this command can also deploy or resume a function, however it cannot pause or undeploy a function.

a| Import only the JavaScript code for one Eventing Function in the cluster.  
Note the JavaScript supplied is not escaped (unlike /api/v1/functions/[function_name]) and could come from other environments.
It is highly recommended that you use the flag *--data-binary* or *--upload-file* when importing your JavaScript "appcode" fragments
