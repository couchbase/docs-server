= Function: Advanced Document Controlled Expiry
:description: pass:q[Purge a document automatically based on self-contained start and duration fields.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: {description}

* This function *advancedDocControlledSelfExpiry* demonstrates self-expiry of a document; for example, a user trial.
* Requires a metadata bucket and a source bucket.
* The source bucket must be named "source" and the Function needs a bucket alias of "src_bkt" in mode read+write.
* When documents are created, they will have no expiration value. This function processes the initial mutation to calculate and set the proper TTL.
* As we are using Advanced Bucket Accessors setting document expirations (or TTLs) we use a JavaScript Data object.
* Will operate on any document with type == "trial_customers".
* Will ignore any doc with a non-zero TTL
* This is different than setting a TTL on a bucket which will typically update (or extend) the TTL of a document on each mutation.

Two variants of this function are available - a 6.6 version that relies on N1QL and a 6.6.1 version (*this Function*) that directly sets the expiration.  
You can completely avoid _N1QL(...)_ and use _couchbase.replace(bucket_binding, meta, doc)_ as the advancedDocControlledSelfExpiry variant is much faster.

We want to create a test set of four (4) documents, use the Query Editor to insert the the data items (you do not need an index).

Note, if the today is past 01-06-2020 (MM-DD-YYYY) just change the `trialStartDate` for the last two records to at least 90 days from now.

[source,n1ql]
----
  UPSERT INTO `source` (KEY,VALUE)
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::0", {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 0,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2019",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::1",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 1,
    "trialStartDate": "01-27-2020",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this is old will get immeadiately deleted"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::2",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 2,
    "trialStartDate": "08-25-2021",
    "trialDurationDays": 30,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"
  } ),
  VALUES ( "trial_customers::3",
  {
    "type": "trial_customers",
    "id": 3,
    "trialStartDate": "08-26-2021",
    "trialDurationDays": 60,
    "note": "this will get an exiration set"
  } );

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::2

{
  "id": 2,
  "note": "this will get an exiration set",
  "trialDurationDays": 30,
  "trialStartDate": "08-25-2021",
  "type": "trial_customers"
}

NEW/OUTPUT: KEY trial_customers::3

{
  "id": 3,
  "note": "this will get an exiration set",
  "trialDurationDays": 60,
  "trialStartDate": "08-26-2021",
  "type": "trial_customers"
}

We end up with two (2) of the four documents (obviously you may need to adjust the N1QL INSERT in a few months as all the document would be immediately deleted).

* "trial_customers::0" was deleted 
* "trial_customers::1" was deleted 
* "trial_customers::2" has an meta.expiration set for 1632466800 (or 2021-09-24 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata 
* "trial_customers::3" has an meta.expiration set for 1635145200 (or 2021-10-25 07:00:00 UTC) in it's metadata
