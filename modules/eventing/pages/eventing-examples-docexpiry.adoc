= Document Expiry
:description: pass:q[When a document in an existing collection is about to expire, a new document is created in a different collection.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition
:tabs:

*Goal*: {description}

*Implementation*: 

Create a JavaScript Function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler, which runs whenever a document is created (or mutated).
The Eventing Function calls a timer routine, which executes a callback function, two minutes prior to any document’s established expiration.
This function retrieves a specified value from the document, and stores a document with the same key, in a specified target collection.
The original document in the source collection is not changed during the copy (and will be deleted).

*Preparations*:

For this example, two (2) buckets *'bulk'* and *'rr100'* are required where the latter is intended to be 100% resident.  
Create the buckets with a minimum size of 100MB. 
For information on buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
Within the buckets we need three (3) keyspaces *'bulk.data.source'*, *'bulk.data.target'*, and *'rr100.eventing.metadata'* 
(we loosely follow this xref:eventing-buckets-to-collections.adoc#single-tenancy[organization]).

For the Function Scope or RBAC grouping we will use the *'bulk.data'* assuming you have the role of either "Full Admin" or "Eventing Full Admin". For standard or non-privileged users refer to xref:eventing-roll-based-authentication.adoc[Eventing Role Based Authentication].

_If you run a version of Couchbase prior to 7.0 you can just create the buckets *'source'*, *'target'*, and *'metadata'* and run this example.  Furthermore if your cluster was subsequently upgraded from say 6.6.2 to 7.0 your data would be moved to *'source._default._default'*, *'target._default._default'*, and *'metadata._default._default'* and your Eventing Function would be seamlessly upgraded to use the new keyspaces and continue to run correctly._

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For complete details on how to set up your keyspaces refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[creating buckets] and 
xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[creating scopes and collections].  

NOTE: The Eventing Storage keyspace, in this case *'rr100.eventing.metadata'*, is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from it.  In addition do not drop or flush or delete the containing bucket (or delete this collection) while you have any deployed Eventing functions. In a single tenancy deployment this collection can be shared with other Eventing functions.

You will need to run a special N1QL statement, a _cbc_ (the command-line KV client) or alternatively an SDK python script or Java program to create or update a document in the 'source' bucket, with an expiration time of 600 seconds.

*Procedure*:

. The example requires a document to be created in the 'source' collection with a key of *SampleDocument2*, a value of *{'a_key': 'a_value'}*, and most importantly that the document's expiration (or TTL) set to 600 seconds or 10 minutes). 
+
There are several methods to make a test document with an expiration set. The easiest is most likely using N1QL.  However you can use _cbc_ or any Couchbase SDK (the command-line KV client is compiled from the C SDK).  For example you can use a Python script or a complied Java program.

N1QL UPDATE::
+
--
Using the Query Workbench::
[source,N1QL]
----
UPSERT INTO `bulk`.`data`.`source` (KEY, VALUE) VALUES ("SampleDocument2", {"a_key":"a_value"}, {"expiration":600});
----
Issue the above command in the Query Workbench of the UI.

For information on setting document expiration times via N1QL, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/insert.adoc#insert-document-with-expiration[Insert a document with expiration]

The cbc binary, or KV client::
+
--
On Linux::
[source,console]
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc \
    create SampleDocument2 -V '{"a_key": "a_value"}' \
    -U couchbase://localhost/source \
    --scope=data --collection=source \
    -u Administrator -P password \
    --expiry=600 
----
on macOS
[source,console]
----
/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbc \
    create SampleDocument2 -V '{"a_key": "a_value"}' -U couchbase://localhost/source \
    --scope=data --collection=source \
    -u Administrator -P password \
    --expiry=600
----
on Windows
[source,console]
----
"C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbc" ^
    create SampleDocument2 -V "{'a_key': 'a_value'}" -U couchbase://localhost/source ^
    --scope=data --collection=source ^
    -u Administrator -P password ^
    --expiry=600
----
Use the command-line KV client, e.g. the _cbc_ binary, and cut-n-paste one of the above commands to create the needed sample document.

We are passing --expiry the number of time in seconds from now at which the item should expire. However if you want an expiry over 30 days you must use the number of seconds since Unix Epoch.

On macOS (or OS-X) if you get a 'dyld: Library not loaded' when running _cbc_ a solution is documented in https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-37768[MB-37768^].

For information on the cbc tool, refer to xref:2.10@c-sdk::webui-cli-access.adoc#using-the-command-line-kv-client[Using the command-line KV client].

Python SDK script::
+
--
[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import couchbase.collection
import couchbase.subdocument as SD
from couchbase.cluster import Cluster, ClusterOptions
from couchbase_core.cluster import PasswordAuthenticator
from couchbase.durability import ServerDurability, Durability
from datetime import timedelta

pa = PasswordAuthenticator('Administrator', 'password')
cluster = Cluster('couchbase://127.0.0.1', ClusterOptions(pa))
bucket = cluster.bucket('bulk')
collection = bucket.scope('data').collection('source')

try:
  document = dict( a_key="a_value" )
  result = collection.upsert(
    'SampleDocument2',
    document,
    expiry=timedelta(minutes=10)
  )
  print("UPSERT SUCCESS")
  print("cas result:", result.cas)
except:
  print("exception:", sys.exc_info())
----
Make an executable script as above and then it.  Alternatively run the command _python3_ to start a Python session then cut-n-paste the above line (without the `#!/usr/bin/python3` line) to create the needed sample document and then ^D (or ctrl-D) to close the Python session.

. You now have a document in collection 'source' (keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`) with an expiration set. 

. To verify that your new document was created, access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page and click the *Documents* then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`.
The new document gets displayed automatically (as this page will attempt to list the first few items). You will see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` keyspace (this will disappear on the document's expiry of 10 minutes).
+
image::docexpiry_05_buckets.png[,100%]

. [Optional Step] Click on the document's id, *SampleDocument2* to view the documents Data and also the documents Metadata information.  Note that the "expiration" field in the Metadata is non-zero (set to a  Unix timestamp in seconds since epoch).
. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Function Scope* drop-down, select *'bulk.data'* as the RBAC grouping.
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-down, select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the keyspace.
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-down, select *rr100*, *eventing*, *metadata* as the keyspace.
 ** Enter *add_timer_before_expiry* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** Leave the "Deployment Feed Boundary" as Everything.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *Function that adds timer to fire before document expiry*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src* as the "alias name" of the collection, 
 select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the associated keyspace, and select "read only" for the access mode.
 *** For the second binding, select "bucket alias", specify *tgt* as the "alias name" of the collection, 
 select *bulk*, *data*, and *target* as the associated keyspace, and select "read and write" for the access mode.
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:

. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *add_timer_before_expiry* dialog appears.
** The *add_timer_before_expiry* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *add_timer_before_expiry code* in this block.
+

function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // Only process for those documents that have a non-zero TTL
    if (meta.expiration == 0 ) return;
    // Get the TTL and compute 2 minutes prior to the TTL, note JavaScript Date() takes msec.
    var twoMinsPrior = new Date((meta.expiration - 2*60) * 1000);
    // Create a context and then create a timer with our context
    var context = { docID : meta.id, expiration : meta.expiration };
    createTimer(DocTimerCallback, twoMinsPrior , meta.id, context);
    log('OnUpdate add Timer 2 min. prior to TTL to DocId:',  meta.id);

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:
+
image::docexpiry_03_editor_with_code.png[,100%]
** Click *Save and Return*.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *add_timer_before_expiry* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.
+
image::docexpiry_03a_deploy.png[,100%]
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds.  From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents and on subsequent mutations.

. Look at the Log for *add_timer_before_expiry* once it deploys (the "*Log*" link will appear once the function is deployed)
+
----
2021-07-17T15:34:21.034-07:00 [INFO] "OnUpdate add Timer 2 min. prior to TTL to DocId:" "SampleDocument2"
----

. Now look at the *Buckets* in the UI the `rr100`.`eventing`.`metadata` keyspace will have 1280 documents related to the Eventing function and three (3) additional documents related to the timer
+
image::docexpiry_04_buckets.png[,100%]

. If you select *Scopes & Collections* (on the right) from the bucket *bulk*, then click on *data* (on the left) you should see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` collection (that you poked in via N1QL, cbc, Python or Java).
+
image::docexpiry_04a_buckets.png[,100%]

. Wait a several minutes, return to Eventing in the UI and Look at the Log data again for *add_timer_before_expiry* at two minutes before the TTL was scheduled the timer will have fired and executed DocTimerCallback (note the logs display by the "*Log*" link are in reverse time order).  _Note the document this is based on had a 10 minute expiration and the timer will fire 2 minutes prior to that expiration (thus you might wait almost 8 minutes)_.
+
You should see four log lines:
+
----
2021-07-17T15:42:03.481-07:00 [INFO] "DocTimerCallback 3 tgt archive via Key:" "SampleDocument2"
2021-07-17T15:42:03.481-07:00 [INFO] "DocTimerCallback 2 src expiry:" "2021-07-17T22:44:00.000Z"
2021-07-17T15:42:03.478-07:00 [INFO] "DocTimerCallback 1 on DocId:" "SampleDocument2"
2021-07-17T15:34:21.034-07:00 [INFO] "OnUpdate add Timer 2 min. prior to TTL to DocId:" "SampleDocument2"
----
+
The final result, is a new document containing a copy of the data from the original, named *SourceDocument2* being written to the collection 'target' with the same Key in the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`target`.

. Now look at the *Documents* in the UI again you will see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` keyspace (this will disappear on the document's expiry of 10 minutes).
+
image::docexpiry_05_buckets.png[,100%]

. Now look at the *Documents* in the UI again you will see one (1) document in the `bulk`.`data`.`target` keyspace (this will persist)
+
image::docexpiry_05a_buckets.png[,100%]

. Wait a few more minutes (actual just bit more than two minutes) past the 120 second window, then check the document in the `bulk`.`data`.`source` keyspace', you will find that it is missing and will not be accessible as it has expired due to the defined TTL on the document. 
+
NOTE: If you don’t actually try to access the document by clicking on the *Documents" link the UI and specifying the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source` the UI may indicate it still exists until the expiry pager removes the tombstone for the deleted or expired documents (or an actual attempt to access it is made).
+
image::docexpiry_06_buckets.png[,100%]

*Cleanup*:

Go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *add_timer_before_expiry*, this will remove the 1280 documents for each function from the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' collection (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' keyspace if there are no deployed Eventing Functions.

Now flush the 'bulk' bucket if you plan to run other examples (you may need to Edit the bucket 'bulk' and enable the flush capability).
