= External REST via cURL GET

:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: Demonstrate accessing a cURL REST end point via GET to fetch Daily Exchange Rate data.

*Implementation*: Implementation: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler with a cURL GET request in a Timer callback function. The handler listens for mutations or data-changes within a specified source bucket. When any document within the bucket is created or modified, the handler creates a callback in the future to execute a user-defined routine to fetch exchange rates. The initial timer is created just 30 seconds in the future, the next timers 2-N are created at the beginning of the next day. In this example, we rely on a control document which if mutated controls whether a Recurring Timer will be created or canceled.

We will also rely on a public REST API that can be access via a cURL GET. _Please test the below on a command line before proceeding to make sure the REST endpoint is live._

[source,shell]
----
curl -q -X GET 'https://api.ratesapi.io/api/latest'
----

The Couchbase Eventing Code to perform a cURL request is pretty trivial (below), but in this example the final Eventing function will do a lot more, such as adding a recurring timer to build up a set of documents with the exchange rates for every day.

[source,JavaScript]
----
        // ==============================
        // Perform a cURL GET here
        var request = {
            path: apiReqDateUtc
        };
        //  perform the cURL reques using the URL alias form the settings
        var response = curl('GET', exchangeRateApi, request);
        var status = "OKAY";
        if (response.status != 200 && response.status != 302) {
            status = "FAIL";
        }
        // ==============================
----

Although this API can take serve up exact dates by substituting the parameter "latest" for an exact date 2020-08-05, we will rely on the "latest" results. On success we expect to see a returned JSON payload as follows:

We will perform the following tests with the Eventing Function:

** *Test 1*: The control document is created or mutated in such a way that a Timer is created, and initially fires approximately 30 seconds in the future. At this point a document is fetched from an External Rest endpoint (representing the user work) and this document is written to the source bucket. The original control document, in the source bucket, is not changed.  The Timer is re-armed for the beginning of the following day and will execute again and again until canceled fetching a new Daily Exchange Rate.

** *Test 2*: The control document is mutated in such a way that any existing Timer with the reference of the control document's id (meta.id) is canceled. This has no effect if the Timer created has already fired.

*Preparations (Common)*

For this example, two buckets 'source' and 'metadata', are required (note the metadata bucket for Eventing can be shared with other Eventing functions). Make both buckets with minimum size of 100MB.

For steps to create buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].

NOTE: The 'metadata' bucket is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from this bucket. In addition do not drop or flush or delete the bucket while you have any deployed Eventing functions.

*Setup*:

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
** You should see the following once you have created your buckets:
+
image::recurring_timer_01_buckets.png[,800]
// reuse image 

. Click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** You should see no user records.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_documents.png[,800]
// reuse image
+
** Click *Add Document* in the upper right banner.
** In the *Add Document* dialog, specify the name *recurring_timer::1* as the *New Document ID*.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_add_document.png[,350]
// reuse image
+
** Click *Save*.
** In the *Edit Document* dialog, the following text is displayed:
+
----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** Replace the above text with the following JSON document via copy and paste.
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}

+
** Click *Save*.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Source Bucket* drop-down, select *source*.
 ** For the *Metadata Bucket* drop-down, select *metadata*.
 ** Enter *external_rest_via_curl_get* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *"Explore using an external REST endpoint to fetch daily data via a GET operation via a recurring timer.  The initial fetch will be 30 seconds in the future the following fetches will be at the start of each subsequent day."*, in the *Description* text-box.
  ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add just one binding.
 *** For the binding, select the "bucket alias", specify *src_bkt* as the "alias name" of the bucket, select *source* as the associated bucket, and select "read and write".
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::ext_rest_via_curl_01_settings.png[,484]
. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *ext_rest_via_curl* dialog appears.
** The *ext_rest_via_curl* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *ext_rest_via_curl* code in this block.

After pasting, the screen appears as displayed below:

** Click *Save*.
** To return to the Eventing screen, click the '*< back to Eventing*' link (below the editor) or click *Eventing* tab.

. The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the bucket, actions will be processed according to the field within the document.  First we ignore all documents that do not have a doc.type of "recurring_timer" -- this is the control document.  Next we use the field "active" to determine which action we take.  

* If "active" is true we will create a series of daily Timers that will fire. However the first timer will be approximately 30 seconds in the future from the time of deployment, for testing purposes.
* If "active" is false we will cancel the existing Timer if any.
* In the event a Timer created by this Function fires, the callback *RecurringTimerCallback* executes and writes a new document with a similar key (but with "cur_" prepended) into the "source" bucket.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click *Deploy*.
** In the *Confirm Deploy Function* dialog, select *Everything* from the *Feed boundary* option.
** Click *Deploy Function*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents, and more importantly it will also run on subsequent mutations.

== Test 1: Create a Recurring Timer and allow the Timer to Fire and Rearm

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page and click the *Documents* link of the *source* bucket.
** Edit the control document *recurring_timer::1* - it should look like this:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}
----
+
Change "active" to true then click *Save*.  This will create a mutation and the Function will generate the first of a series of recurring Timers.  The control document is now:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": true
}
----

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and if necessary select the Function *external_rest_via_curl_get*, then click the "Log" link for the Deployed Function to view the activity.  
** Here we see from the Application log that we created a timer. Note the log is in reverse order, and the bottom (or first) message was a NOOP, because doc.active was false when we first deployed and we tried to cancel any timer if it was running.

*Cleanup*:

To clean up, go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *external_rest_via_curl_get*; this will remove the 2048 documents for each function from the 'metadata' bucket (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'metadata' bucket if there are no deployed Eventing functions.
