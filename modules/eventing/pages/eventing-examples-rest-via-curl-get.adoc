= External REST via cURL GET
:description: pass:q[Demonstrate accessing a cURL REST end point via GET to fetch Daily Exchange Rate data.]
:page-edition: Enterprise Edition

*Goal*: {description}

*Implementation*: Create a JavaScript function that contains an *OnUpdate* handler with a cURL GET request in a Timer callback function. The handler listens for mutations or data-changes within a specified source bucket. When any document within the bucket is created or modified, the Eventing Function creates a callback in the future to execute a user-defined routine to fetch exchange rates. The initial timer is created just 30 seconds in the future, the next timers 2-N are created at the beginning of the next day. In this example, we rely on a control document which if mutated controls whether a Recurring Timer will be created or canceled.

We will also rely on a public REST API that can be access via a cURL GET. _Please test the below on a command line before proceeding to make sure one of the REST endpoints is live._

[source,shell]

curl -q -X GET 'https://api.frankfurter.app/latest'
curl -q -X GET 'https://api.ratesapi.io/api/latest'

_If both of the above URLs are offline there are pay sites that provide similar information or 
can roll your own mini server in python._

    def _set_headers(self):
        self.send_response(HTTPStatus.OK.value)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.end_headers()

        self._set_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(message).encode('utf-8'))

The Couchbase Eventing Code to perform a cURL request is pretty trivial (below), but in this example the final Eventing function will do a lot more, such as adding a recurring timer to build up a set of documents with the exchange rates for every day.

[source,JavaScript]
----
        // ==============================
        // Perform a cURL GET here
        var request = {
            path: apiReqDateUtc
        };
        //  perform the cURL request using the URL alias form the settings
        var response = curl('GET', exchangeRateApi, request);
        var status = "OKAY";
        if (response.status != 200 && response.status != 302) {
            status = "FAIL";
        }
        // ==============================
----

Although either of the above remote APIs can take on forms that serve up exact dates by substituting the parameter "latest" for an exact date 2020-08-05, we will rely on the "latest" results. On success we expect to see a returned JSON payload as follows:

[source,json]

If you roll your own server using the above python sample (use a real IP for instead of localhost if you are not on the Couchbase server) the returned data will be static but the date will always be current.

We will perform the following tests with the Eventing Function:

** *Test 1*: The control document is created or mutated in such a way that a Timer is created, and initially fires approximately 30 seconds in the future. At this point a document is fetched from an External Rest endpoint (representing the user work) and this document is written to the source bucket. The original control document, in the source bucket, is not changed.  The Timer is re-armed for the beginning of the following day and will execute again and again until canceled fetching a new Daily Exchange Rate.

** *Test 2*: The control document is mutated in such a way that any existing Timer with the reference of the control document's id (meta.id) is canceled. This has no effect if the Timer created has already fired.

*Preparations (Common):*

For this example, two (2) buckets *'bulk'* and *'rr100'* are required where the latter is intended to be 100% resident.  
Create the buckets with a minimum size of 100MB. 
For information on buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
Within the buckets we need three (2) keyspaces *'bulk.data.source'* and *'rr100.eventing.metadata'* 
(we loosely follow this xref:eventing-buckets-to-collections.adoc#single-tenancy[organization]).

_If you run a version of Couchbase prior to 7.0 you can just create the buckets *'source'* and *'metadata'* and run this example.  Furthermore if your cluster was subsequently upgraded from say 6.6.2 to 7.0 your data would be moved to *'source._default._default'* and *'metadata._default._default'* and your Eventing Function would be seamlessly upgraded to use the new keyspaces and continue to run correctly._

// TODO7X - need to check/fix this (buckets, scopes, collections)
For complete details on how to set up your keyspaces refer to xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[creating buckets] and 
xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[creating scopes and collections].  

NOTE: The Eventing Storage keyspace, in this case *'rr100.eventing.metadata'*, is for the sole use of the Eventing system, do not add, modify, or delete documents from it.  In addition do not drop or flush or delete the containing bucket (or delete this collection) while you have any deployed Eventing functions. In a single tenancy deployment this collection can be shared with other Eventing functions.

*Setup*:

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Buckets* page.
** You should see the following once you have created your buckets:
+
image::recurring_timer_01_buckets.png[,100%]

. [Optional Step] Verify we have our empty collections:
** Click the *Scopes & Collections* link of the *bulk* bucket (on the right).
** Click the *data* scope name to expand the section (on the left).
** You should see no user records.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_data_in_scope.png[,100%]
+
. Click the *Documents* link of the *source* collection (on the right).
** Again you should see no user records.
+
image::recurring_timer_01_documents.png[,800]
+
** Click *Add Document* in the upper right banner
** For the *ID* in the *Create New Document* dialog specify *recurring_timer::1*
+
----
ID [ recurring_timer::1       ]
----
+
** For the document body in the *Create New Document* dialog, the following text is displayed:
+
----
{
"click": "to edit",
"with JSON": "there are no reserved field names"
}
----
** replace the above text with the following JSON document via a cut-n-paste
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}
----
+
image::recurring_timer_01_docdata.png[,484]
+
** Click *Save*.

. From the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page, click *ADD FUNCTION*, to add a new Function.
The *ADD FUNCTION* dialog appears.
. In the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, for individual Function elements provide the below information:
 ** For the *Listen To Location* drop-down, select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the keyspace.
 ** For the *Eventing Storage* drop-down, select *rr100*, *eventing*, *metadata* as the keyspace.
 ** Enter *external_rest_via_curl_get* as the name of the Function you are creating in the *Function Name* text-box.
 ** Leave the "Deployment Feed Boundary" as Everything.
 ** [Optional Step] Enter text *"Explore using an external REST endpoint to fetch daily data via a GET operation via a recurring timer.  The initial fetch will be 30 seconds in the future the following fetches will be at the start of each subsequent day."*, in the *Description* text-box.
 ** For the *Settings* option, use the default values.
 ** For the *Bindings* option, add two bindings.
 *** For the first binding, select "bucket alias", specify *src_col* as the "alias name" of the collection, 
 select *bulk*, *data*, *source* as the associated keyspace, and select "read and write" for the access mode.
 *** For the second binding, select "URL alias", specify *exchangeRateApi* as the "alias name" of the URL, 
 specify *https://api.frankfurter.app/latest* for the actual URL, and "no auth" and no "cookies". _Note we one be adding "latest" to the end of the URL the Eventing Functions JavaScript will add YYYY-MM-DD for yesterday_.
 ** After configuring your settings the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog should look like this:
+
image::ext_rest_via_curl_01_settings.png[,484]

. After providing all the required information in the *ADD FUNCTION* dialog, click *Next: Add Code*.
The *ext_rest_via_curl* dialog appears.
** The *ext_rest_via_curl* dialog initially contains a placeholder code block.
You will substitute your actual *ext_rest_via_curl* code in this block.
+
image::ext_rest_via_curl_02_editor_with_default.png[,100%]
** Copy the following Function, and paste it in the placeholder code block of *external_rest_via_curl_get* dialog.

** Click *Save and Return*.

. The *OnUpdate* routine specifies that when a change occurs to data within the "source" collection, actions will be processed according to the field within the document.  First we ignore all documents that do not have a doc.type of "recurring_timer" -- this is the control document.  Next we use the field "active" to determine which action we take.  

* If "active" is true we will create a series of daily Timers that will fire. However the first timer will be approximately 30 seconds in the future from the time of deployment, for testing purposes.
* If "active" is false we will cancel the existing Timer if any.
* In the event a Timer created by this Function fires, the callback *RecurringTimerCallback* executes and writes a new document with a similar key (but with "cur_" prepended) into the "source" collection.

. From the *Eventing* screen, click the *external_rest_via_curl_get* function to select it, then click *Deploy*.

. The Eventing function is deployed and starts running within a few seconds. From this point, the defined Function is executed on all existing documents, and more importantly it will also run on subsequent mutations.

== Test 1: Create a Recurring Timer and allow the Timer to Fire and Rearm

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`
** Edit the control document *recurring_timer::1* -- it should look like this:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": false
}

Change "active" to true then click *Save*.  This will create a mutation and the Function will generate the first of a series of recurring Timers.  The control document is now:

{
  "type": "recurring_timer",
  "id": 1,
  "active": true

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Eventing* page and if necessary select the Function *external_rest_via_curl_get*, then click the "Log" link for the Deployed Function to view the activity.  
** Here we see from the Application log that we created a timer. Note the log is in reverse order, and the bottom (or first) message was a NOOP, because doc.active was false when we first deployed and we tried to cancel any timer if it was running.

. Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Documents* page then select the keyspace `bulk`.`data`.`source`
** Edit the control document *recurring_timer::1* -- it should look like this:
+
----
{
  "type": "recurring_timer",

  "active": true
}
----
+

*Cleanup*:

Go to the Eventing portion of the UI and undeploy the Function *cancel_overwrite_timer*, this will remove the 1280 documents (2048 prior to 7.0.0) for the function from the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' collection (in the Bucket view of the UI). Remember you may only delete the 'rr100.eventing.metadata' keyspace if there are no deployed Eventing Functions.

Now flush the 'bulk' bucket if you plan to run other examples (you may need to Edit the bucket 'bulk' and enable the flush capability).
