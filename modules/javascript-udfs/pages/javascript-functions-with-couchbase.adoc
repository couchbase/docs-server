== Introduction

include::partial$javascript-udf-introduction.adoc[]


If you want to learn how to create JavaScript function libraries using the administration console and/or the REST-API then take a look at our xref:guides:javascript-udfs.adoc[JavaScript UDF Guides].

== Added Constructs

Javascript functions in Couchbase support most of the language constructs available in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript[ECMAScript], though there are a number of restrictions related to the Couchbase environment. 
There are also additions that have been made to the language for working specifically with Couchbase.

=== {sqlpp} Embedded Statements

Top level {sqlpp} keywords, such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE, are available as inline keywords in functions.
Operations that return values such as SELECT are accessible through a returned iterable handle. 
{sqlpp} Query results, via a SELECT, are streamed in batches to the iterable handle as the iteration progresses through the result set.

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$select-airline-inline.js[]
----
<1> The {sqlpp} is written directly into the JavaScript code without having to be used as part of a function call.
We can even provide parameters that can be used in the {sqlpp} statement.
<2> A standard JavaScript iterator is used to access the values returned from the {sqlpp} statement.

== Unsupported Features

=== Browser Extensions

Because JavaScript UDF functions do not execute in the context of a browser, the extensions that browsers add to the core language, such as window methods, DOM events etc. are not available.

=== Global State
All variables  must be local to the function; global state is not permitted.

[source, javascript]

include::example$illegal-global-variable.js[]

Along with global state, global https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions[arrow functions] are not supported.
Arrow functions local to individual javascript functions are supported.

=== Logging

Logging using the `console.log(..)` function is not supported.

In the rest of this section, we're going to look at the concepts behind JavaScript User-Defined Functions:
