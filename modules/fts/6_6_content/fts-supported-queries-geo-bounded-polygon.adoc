= Creating a Query: Polygon-Based

The following query-body uses an array, each of whose elements is a string, containing two floating-point numbers; to specify the latitude and longitude of each of the corners of a polygon &#8212; known as _polygon points_.
In each string, the `lat` floating-point value precedes the `lon.`

Here, the last-specified string in the array is identical to the initial string, thus explicitly closing the box.
However, specifying an explicit closure in this way is optional: the closure will be inferred by Couchbase Server if not explicitly specified.

If a target data-location falls within the box, its document is returned.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.
