[#match-all-query]
= Match All Query

Matches _all_ documents in an index, irrespective of terms.
For example, if an index is created on the `travel-sample` bucket for documents of type `zucchini`, the _match all_ query returns all document IDs from the `travel-sample` bucket, even though the bucket contains no documents of type `zucchini`.
