[#term-range]
= Term Range Query

A _term range_ query finds documents containing a term in the specified field within the specified range.
Define the endpoints using the fields [.param]`min` and [.param]`max`.
You can omit one endpoint, but not both.
The [.param]`inclusive_min` and [.param]`inclusive_max` properties control whether or not the endpoints are included or excluded.
By default, [.param]`min` is inclusive and [.param]`max` is exclusive.
