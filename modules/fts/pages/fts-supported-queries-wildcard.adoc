= Wildcard Query

A _wildcard_ query uses a wildcard expression, to search within individual terms for matches.
Wildcard expressions can be any single character (`?`) or zero to many characters (`*`).
Wildcard expressions can appear in the middle or end of a term, but not at the beginning. 
Please note that the wildcard query is a non-analytic query, meaning it won't perform any text analysis on the query text.
