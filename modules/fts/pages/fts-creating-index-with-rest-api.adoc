= Index Creation with REST API

The REST API can be used to create indexes.
Each call requires the following:

* An appropriate username and password.
* Use of the verb `PUT`.
* An endpoint referring to the Full Text Search service, on port `8094`; and including the appropriate endpoint for index creation as defined by the xref:rest-api:rest-fts.adoc[Full Text Search REST API], including the name of the new index.
* Headers to specify settings for `cache-control` (`no-cache`) and `application-type` (`application/json`).
* A body containing the JSON document that defines the index to be created.
This must include the name of the bucket on which the index is to be created.

The simplest way to create the appropriate JSON index-definition for the body is to create an index by means of the Couchbase Web Console, make a copy of the JSON index-definition thereby produced (by accessing the xref:fts-creating-index-using-the-index-definition-preview.adoc[Using the Index Definition Preview], explained above), modify the index-definition as appropriate, and finally, add the index-definition to the other, preceding elements required for the call.

Note, however, that this requires modification of the `uuid` field; since the re-specifying of an existing field-value is interpreted as an attempted _update_, to an existing index.
Therefore, if the `uuid` field for an existing index appears in the Index Definition Preview as `"uuid": "3402702ff3c862c0"`, it should be edited to appear `"uuid": ""`.
A new ID will be allocated to the new index, and this ID will appear in the Index Definition Preview for the new index.

Note also that a similar condition applies to the `sourceUUID` field, which refers to the targeted bucket: if a new index is being created for the same bucket that was referred to in the index-object copied from the UI, the field-value can remain the same.
However, if a different bucket is now to be targeted, the field should be edited to appear `"sourceUUID": ""`

When specifying the endpoint for the index you are creating, make sure the path-element that concludes the endpoint is the same as that specified in the `name` field (which is the first field in the object).

The following `curl` example demonstrates the creation of an index named `demoIndex`, on the `price` field of documents of type `product`, within the `travel-sample` bucket.
It assumes that Couchbase Server is running on `localhost`, and that the required username and password are `Administrator` and `password.`

The newly created index can then be inspected in the Couchbase Web Console.

== Index Update with REST API

Specifying the "uuid" parameter in the index definition is required for the index creation to be treated as a valid update. 

NOTE: This uuid in the JSON body of a valid index update request has to match that of the existing index definition. Upon successful creation/update of an index, the uuid will be re-initialized.
