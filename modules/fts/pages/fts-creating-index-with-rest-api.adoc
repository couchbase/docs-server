= Index Creation or Update via the REST API

== Index Creation with REST API

The REST API can be used to create indexes via a simple athenticated PUT.

The below `curl` example demonstrates the creation of an index named `demoIndex`, on the `inventory` scope  and `airline` collection, within the `travel-sample`.`inventory` bucket and scope.
It is assumed that the command is run on the Couchbase Server or `localhost`, and that the required username and password are set in the environment variables `$CB_USERNAME` and `$CB_PASSWORD` for authentication.

The simplest way to create the appropriate JSON body for the index-definition is to create an index by means of the Couchbase Web Console. 

* Copy the JSON index-definition preview produced by the Clasic Editor (xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor.adoc#using-the-index-definition-preview[Classic Editor: Using the Index Definition Preview]).
* Modify the index-definition as needed.
* Use the index-definition as the body as the payload to your REST call.

NOTE: A non-empty `uuid` in the JSON definition field specfied is interpreted as an attempted _update_, to an existing index. In addition the non-empty `sourceUUID` field, generated in the UI refers to the targeted collection if a different collection is to be targeted, the field should be removed or edited to appear `"sourceUUID": ""`.  Both of these fields, `uuid` and `sourceUUID`, can either be removed or set to `"uuid": ""` and `"sourceUUID": ""` when creating a new index. 

When specifying the endpoint for the index you are creating, make sure the path-element that concludes the URL is the same as that specified in the `name` field (which is the first field in the object).

The newly created index can then be inspected in the Couchbase Web Console, however the Web Console will require a refresh.

== Index Update with REST API

Specifying a non-null "uuid" parameter in the index definition is required to perfrom an index update. 

NOTE: The  `uuid` value in the JSON body of a valid index update request has to match that of the existing index definition. Upon successful creation/update of an index, the `uuid` will always be re-initialized.

Assume you specified the wrong collection and instead of `airline` you really wanted `airport` (from the scope travel-sample.inventory).  To update the index use the Couchbase Web Console to find your correct "uuid" (remember you should always refresh the browser page is you are using the REST API). An example "uuid" will look something like `"uuid": "7a7506d5ab9bce58"` *your "uuid" will differ.* Note in the below REST payload the field "sourceUUID" was removed as it is unique to a specific cluster *you will have a different cluster.*
