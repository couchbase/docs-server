= Query String Query

A _query string_ can be used, to express a given query by means of a special syntax.

A demonstration of a query string Query using the Java SDK can be found in xref:3.2@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].

NOTE: The Full Text Searches conducted with the Couchbase Web Console themselves use query strings.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI].)

Certain queries supported by FTS are not yet supported by the query string syntax.
These include wildcards and regular expressions.

More detailed information is provided in xref:query-string-queries.adoc[Query String Queries].
