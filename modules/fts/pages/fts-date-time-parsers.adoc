= Date/Time Parsers

Custom _date/time parsers_ can be specified to allow matches to be made across date/time formats.

The Search Service expects dates to be in the format specified by RFC-3339 , which is a specific profile of ISO-8601. Since Search queries need to specify dates in RFC-3339 format, the dates that are stored in Full Text Indexes also need to be in RFC-3339 format.

A date/time parser tells the Search Service ahead of time what the date/time layout of a field will be. If the Type of a child field is set to `datetime`, and the time layout(s) found in that field is not in RFC-3339 format, then you can specify a custom date/time parser that contains the layouts that the Search Service is to expect.

To add a custom date/time parser to a Full Text Index via the Couchbase Capella UI, the following permissions are required:

* You must have `Project View` privileges for the project that contains the cluster. 

* You must have a database user associated with your organization user account. The database user must have Read/Write permissions for the bucket on which the index was created.

* Date/time parsers can be viewed and modified from the index’s configuration page, under the *Index Settings* section. 
+
Any date/time parsers that are configured for the current index can be viewed by expanding the *Date/Time Parsers* panel. If no date/time parsers have been configured for the index, the *Date/Time Parsers* panel will be empty.

== Add Date/Time Parsers

_Date/Time Parsers_ can be specified to allow matches to be made across different formats:

To add the date/time parser 

Left click the *+ Add Date/Time Parser* 

[#fts_date_time_parser_initial]
image::fts-date-time-parser-initial.png[,720,align=left]

The *Customer Date/Time Parser* dialog appears.

[#fts_custom_date_time_parser_dialog]
image::fts-custom-date-time-parser-dialog.png[,420,align=left]

Enter a suitable name for the custom parser into the *Name* field.

Left-click on the *+ Add* button to successively add the _layouts_ for the parser in the interactive field below the *Layouts* field, by  after each one: 

This adds the layout to a list of layouts displayed in the *Layouts* field.

To remove any of these, select its name in the *Layouts* field, and left-click on the *Remove* button.
When the list is complete, left-click on the *Save* button to save.

As an example, consider the index created on a `travel-sample` bucket. The format of date followed in the `reviews.date` field of a document in the hotel collection is-
`2006-01-02 15:04:05 +0300` rather than the RFC 339 format, so build a custom date/time parser:

[#fts_custom_date_time_parser_example]
image::fts-custom-date-time-parser-example.png[,420,align=left]

Furthermore, the type mapping section must have an mapping for the `reviews.date` field which looks something like this:

[#fts_date_time_parser_type_mapping]
image::fts-date-time-parser-type-mapping.png[,720,align=left]

To see check the effect the above parser has, run the following query:
