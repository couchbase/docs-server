= Date/Time Parsers

Custom _date/time parsers_ can be specified to allow matches to be made across date/time formats.

The Search Service expects dates to be in the format specified by RFC-3339 , which is a specific profile of ISO-8601. Since Search queries need to specify dates in RFC-3339 format, the dates that are stored in Full Text Indexes also need to be in RFC-3339 format.

A date/time parser tells the Search Service ahead of time what the date/time layout of a field will be. If the Type of a child field is set to `datetime`, and the time layout(s) found in that field is not in RFC-3339 format, then you can specify a custom date/time parser that contains the layouts that the Search Service is to expect.

NOTE: Permissions Required
In order to add a custom date/time parser to a Full Text Index via the Couchbase Cloud UI, the following permissions are required:

 ** You must have Project View privileges for the project that contains the cluster. 

 ** You must have a database user associated with your organization user account. The database user must have Read/Write permissions for the bucket on which the index was created.

Date/time parsers can be viewed and modified from the indexâ€™s configuration page, under the *Index Settings* section. Any date/time parsers that are configured for the current index can be viewed by expanding the *Date/Time Parsers* panel. If no date/time parsers have been configured for the index, the *Date/Time Parsers* panel will be empty.
