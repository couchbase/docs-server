[#Field-Scoping]
= Field Scoping

You can specify the field in which a search needs to be performed by prefixing the term with a field-name, separated by a colon.

The field-name may be a path to a field, using dot notation.
The path must use Search syntax rather than xref:n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/index.html[N1QL] syntax; in other words, you cannot specify array locations such as `[*]` or `[3]` in the path.

== Required, Optional, and Exclusion

When a query string includes multiple items, by default these are placed into the SHOULD clause of a xref:fts-supported-queries-boolean-field-query.adoc[boolean query].
You can adjust this by prefixing items with `+` or `-`.

* Prefixing with `+` places that item in the MUST portion of the boolean query.
* Prefixing with `-` places that item in the MUST NOT portion of the boolean query.

=== Example

For example, `description:pool` performs a xref:fts-supported-queries-match.adoc[match query] for the term `pool`, in the `description` field.

For example, `+description:pool -continental breakfast` performs a boolean query that MUST satisfy the match query for the term `pool` in the `description` field, MUST NOT satisfy the match query for the term `continental` in the `default` field, and SHOULD satisfy the match query for the term `breakfast` in the `default` field.
Result documents satisfying the SHOULD clause score higher than those that do not.
