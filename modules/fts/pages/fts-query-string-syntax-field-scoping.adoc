= Field Scoping Sytax

You can specify the field in which to search by prefixing the term with a field-name, separated by a colon.

The field-name may be a path to a field, using dot notation.
The path must use Search syntax rather than N1QL syntax; in other words, you cannot specify array locations such as `[*]` or `[3]` in the path.

== Required, Optional, and Exclusion

When a query string includes multiple items, by default these are placed into the SHOULD clause of a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#boolean-query[boolean query].
You can adjust this by prefixing items with `+` or `-`.

* Prefixing with `+` places that item in the MUST portion of the boolean query.
* Prefixing with `-` places that item in the MUST NOT portion of the boolean query.


== Example

* `description:pool` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-query[match query] for the term `pool`, in the `description` field.

* `+description:pool -continental breakfast` performs a boolean query that MUST satisfy the match query for the term `pool` in the `description` field, MUST NOT satisfy the match query for the term `continental` in the `default` field, and SHOULD satisfy the match query for the term `breakfast` in the `default` field.
+
The result documents satisfying the SHOULD clause score higher than those that do not.
