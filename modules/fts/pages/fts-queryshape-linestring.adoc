= QueryShape for a LineString Query

A GeoJSON query via a GeoShape of LineString to find GeoJSON types in a Search index using the 3 relations intersects, contains, and within.

== LineString `Intersects` Query

A `contains` query for linestring returns all the matched documents with shapes that intersect the linestring within the query. 

A linestring `intersection` query sample is given below.

[source, json]

{
  "query": {
    "field": "<<fieldName>>",
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "type": "linestring",
        "coordinates": [
          [1.954764, 50.962097],
          [3.029578, 49.868547]
        ]
      },
      "relation": "intersects"
    }
  }
}

Intersection rules for the LineString Query with other indexed GeoJSON shapes in the document set are given below.

[#geospatial-distance-units,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Intersects (relation) +
Document Shape|{nbsp} +
LineString (GeoShape)

| Point
| Intersects when any of the line endpoints overlap the point in the document. 

| LineString
| Intersects when the linestring in the query intersects the linestring in the document.

| Polygon
| Intersects when the linestring in the query intersects any of the edges of the polygon in the document.

| MultiPoint
| Intersects when any of the line endpoints overlap any of the points in the multipoint array in the document.

| MultiLineString
| Intersects when the linestring in the query intersects any of the linestring in the multilinestring array in the document.

| MultiPolygon
| Intersects when the linestring in the query intersects any of the edges of any of the polygons in the multipolygon array in the document.

| GeometryCollection
| Matches when the query point overlaps with any of the heterogeneous (above 6) shapes in the geometrycollection array in the document.

| Circle
| Intersects when the query point lies within the area of the circular region in the document.

| Envelope
| Intersects when the query point lies within the area of the rectangular/bounded box region in the document.

|=== 

== LineString `Contains` Query

A `contains` query for linestring returns all the matched documents with shapes that contain the linestring within the query. 

A linestring `contains` query sample is given below.

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "field": "<<fieldName>>",
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "type": "linestring",
        "coordinates": [
          [1.954764, 50.962097],
          [3.029578, 49.868547]
        ]
      },
      "relation": "contains"
    }
  }
}
----

Containment rules for the linestring query with other indexed shapes are given below.

[#geospatial-distance-units,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Contains (relation) +
Document Shape|{nbsp} +
LineString (GeoShape)

| Point (document shape)
| NA.   As the  point is a non-closed shape.

| LineString
| NA.  As a linestring is a non-closed shape.

| Polygon
| Contains when both the endpoints(start, end) of the linestring in the query are within the area of the polygon in the document.

| MultiPoint
| NA.  As the multipoint is a non-closed shape.

| MultiLineString
| NA.  As the multilinestring is a non-closed shape.

| MultiPolygon
| Contains when both the endpoints(start, end) of the linestring in the query are within the area of any of the polygons in the multipolygon array in the document.

| GeometryCollection
| Matches when both the endpoints(start, end) of the linestring in query overlaps with any of the heterogeneous (above 6) shapes in the geometrycollection array in the document.

| Circle
| Contains when both the endpoints(start, end) of the linestring in the query are within the area of the circular shape in the document.

| Envelope
| Contains when both the endpoints(start, end) of the linestring in the query are within the area of the rectangle in the document.

== LineString `WithIn` Query

The Within query is not supported by line geometries.

[NOTE]
It is assumed that you have run the example http://192.168.3.150:8000/server/7.1/fts/fts-creating-index-from-REST-geojson.adoc[Creating a GeoJSON Index via the REST API] to ensure your cluster has a GeoJSON dataset and a GeoJSON index on the dataset prior to running this example.

Intersects when any of the line endpoints overlap the point in the document. 

The results are specified to be sorted on `name`. Note type hotel and landmark have a name field and type airport has an airportname field all these values are analyzed as a keyword (exposed as `name`).
