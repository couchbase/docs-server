= Score:none

You can disable the scoring by setting `score` to `none` in the search request. This may be desirable in the situation when scoring (document relevancy) is not needed by the application.

NOTE: Using `"score": "none"` is expected to boost query performance in certain situations. 

== Example

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "score": "none",
  "size": 100
}
