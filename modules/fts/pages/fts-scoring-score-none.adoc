= Score:none
:description: pass:q[You can disable the scoring by setting `score` to `none` in the search request.]

{description} This is recommended in a situation where scoring (document relevancy) is not needed by the application.

NOTE: Using `"score": "none"` is expected to boost query performance in certain situations.

  "query": {
