= Understanding Queries

[abstract]
Full Text Search allows queries to be performed on Full Text Indexes.
Queries can be performed by means of the Couchbase Web Console, the Couchbase REST API, N1QL (using xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc[search functions] in the Query service), or the Couchbase SDK.

[#query-specification-options]
== Query-Specification Options

Full Text Search allows a range of query options.
These include:

* Input-text and target-text can be _analyzed_: this transforms input-text into _token-streams_, according to different specified criteria, so allowing richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching.
* The _fuzziness_ of a query can be specified, so that the scope of matches can be constrained to a particular level of exactitude.
A high degree of fuzziness means that a large number of partial matches may be returned.
* Multiple queries can be specified for simultaneous processing, with one given a higher _boost_ than another; so ensuring that its results are returned at the top of the set.
* _Regular expressions_ and _wildcards_ can be used in text-specification for search-input.
* _Compound_ queries can be designed, such that an appropriate conjunction or disjunction of the total result-set can be returned.

All the above options, and others, are explained in detail on the page xref:fts-query-types.adoc[Query Types].

For information on how to execute queries, see xref:fts-performing-searches.adoc[Performing Searches].

[#sorting-results]
== Sorting Results

The results returned from a Full Text Search can be _sorted_: by *id*, *score*, *field*, and more.
Details are provided in xref:fts-sorting.adoc[Sorting Query Results].

[#query-response-objects]
== Query Response Objects

Every Full Text Search query provides a _response object_.
This contains the query-result; and consists of individual child-objects that respectively contain _status_, a _request-copy_, the number of _hits_ (or matches) achieved, and (optionally) _facets_, which provide aggregation information.

For full information, see xref:fts-response-object-schema.adoc[Handling Response Objects].
