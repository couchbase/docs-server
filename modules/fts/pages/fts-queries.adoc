= Understanding Queries
:description: Full Text Search allows queries to be performed on Full Text Indexes.

[abstract]
{description}
Queries can be performed by means of the Couchbase Web Console, the Couchbase REST API, N1QL (using xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc[search functions] in the Query service), or the Couchbase SDK.

[#query-specification-options]
== Query-Specification Options

Full Text Search allows a range of query options.
These include:

* Input-text and target-text can be _analyzed_: this transforms input-text into _token-streams_, according to different specified criteria, so allowing richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching.
* The _fuzziness_ of a query can be specified, so that the scope of matches can be constrained to a particular level of exactitude.
A high degree of fuzziness means that a large number of partial matches may be returned.
* Multiple queries can be specified for simultaneous processing, with one given a higher _boost_ than another; so ensuring that its results are returned at the top of the set.
* _Regular expressions_ and _wildcards_ can be used in text-specification for search-input.
* _Compound_ queries can be designed, such that an appropriate conjunction or disjunction of the total result-set can be returned.

All the above options, and others, are explained in detail on the page xref:fts-query-types.adoc[Query Types].

[#sorting-results]
== Sorting Results

The results returned from a Full Text Search can be _sorted_: by *id*, *score*, *field*, and more.
Details are provided in xref:fts-sorting.adoc[Sorting Query Results].

[#pagination]
== Pagination [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.1#

The number of results obtained for a Full Text Search request can be large at times. Pagination of these results becomes essential for sorting and displaying a subset of these results.
There are multiple ways to achieve pagination with settings within a search request. Pagination will fetch a deterministic set of results when the results are sorted in a certain fashion.

`size/limit, from/offset`::

These settings can be used to obtain a subset of results and works deterministically when combined with a certain sort order.
The default sort order is based on _score_ (relevance) where the results are ordered from the highest to the lowest score.

Here's an example query that fetches results from the 11th onwards to the 15th that have been ordered by _score_ ..

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "size": 5,
  "from": 10
}
----

`search_after, search_before`::

Using `size/limit` and `offset/from` would fetch at least `size + from` ordered results from a partition and then return the `size` number of results starting at offset `from`.
Deep pagination can therefore get pretty expensive when using `size + from` on a sharded index due to each shard having to possibly return large resultsets (at least `size + from`) over the network for merging at the coordinating node before returning the `size` number of results starting at offset `from`.

For more efficient pagination - the `search_after/search_before` settings can be leveraged.
`search_after` is designed to fetch the `size` number of results after the key specified and `search_before` is designed to fetch the `size` number of results before the key specified.
These settings allow for the client to maintain state while paginating - the sort key of the last result (for search_after) or the first result (for search_before) in the current page.

Note that both the attributes accept an array of strings (sort keys) - the length of this array will need to be the same length of the "sort" array within the search request.
Both `search_after` and `search_before` CANNOT be used witin the same search request.

Here are some examples using `search_after/search_before` over sort key "_id" (an internal field that carries the document ID).

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "sort": ["_id"],
  "search_after": ["hotel_10180"],
  "size": 3
}
----

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "sort": ["_id"],
  "search_before": ["hotel_17595"],
  "size": 4
}
----

Note: A Full Text Search request that doesn't carry any pagination settings will return the first 10 results (`"size: 10", "from": 0`) ordered by _score_ sequentially from the highest to lowest.

[#scoring]
== Scoring [.status]#Couchbase Server 6.6.1#

Search result scoring occurs at query time. The results for a search request are ordered by *score* (relevance) with the sort order being descending, unless explicitly set not to do so.
Couchbase (via bleve) uses a slightly modified version of the standard *tf-idf* algorithm. This deviation is to normalize the score by various relevant factors.

By setting `explain` to `true` within the search request, you will obtain the explanation of how the score was calculated for a result alongside it.

Scores for result document hits are calculated by default, whether the score is used for ordering or not. This means calculation of various frequency and normalization information for the search terms at query time.
Scoring can be disabled by setting `score` to `none` in the search request. This may be desirable in the situation when scoring (document relevancy) isn't needed by the application.
Note that using `"score": "none"` is expected to boost query performance in certain situations. Here's an example search request with scoring disabled.

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "score": "none",
  "size": 100
}
----

[#query-response-objects]
== Query Response Objects

Every Full Text Search query provides a _response object_.
This contains the query-result; and consists of individual child-objects that respectively contain _status_, a _request-copy_, the number of _hits_ (or matches) achieved, and (optionally) _facets_, which provide aggregation information.

[#scan-consistency]
=== Scan Consistency
__Optional__

To specify the consistency guarantee/constraint for index scanning, the accepted values are:

``::
This is the default mode of operation. An empty string represents the "not_bounded" setting - no timestamp vector is used in the index scan.
This is the fastest mode, because it avoids the costs of obtaining the vector and waiting for the index to catch up to the vector.

`at_plus`::
This implements bounded consistency.
The request includes a scan_vector parameter and value, which is used as a lower bound.
This can be used to implement read-your-own-writes (RYOW).

----
{
  "explain": true,
  "fields": [],
  "query": {
      ...
  },
  "ctl": {
    "consistency": {
      "level": "at_plus"
    }
  }
}
