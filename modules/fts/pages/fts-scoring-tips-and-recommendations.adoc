= Scoring Tips and Recommendations

For a select term, FTS calculates the relevancy score. So, the documents having a higher relevancy score automatically appear at the top in the result. 

It is often observed that users are using Full-Text Search for the exact match queries with a bit of fuzziness or other search-specific capabilities like geo. 

Text relevancy score does not matter when the user is looking for exact or more targeted searches with many predicates or when the dataset size is small.

In such a case, FTS unnecessarily uses more resources in calculating the relevancy score. Users can, however, optimize the query performance by skipping the scoring. Users may skip the scoring by passing a “score”: “none” option in the search request. 

== Example
{
 
 "query": {},
 "score": "none",
 "size": 10,
 "from": 0

}

This improves the search query performance significantly in many cases, especially for composite queries with many child search clauses.
