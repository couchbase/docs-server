[#Date-Range]
= Date Range

You can perform date range searches by using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, followed by a date value in quotes.

For example, `created:>"2016-09-21"` will perform a xref:fts-supported-queries-date-range.adoc[date range query] on the `created` field for values after September 21, 2016.
