= Date Ranges Syntax

You can perform date range searches by using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, followed by a date value in quotes.

== Example

`created:>"2016-09-21"` 

The above example will perform a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#date-range[date range query] on the `created` field for values after September 21, 2016.
