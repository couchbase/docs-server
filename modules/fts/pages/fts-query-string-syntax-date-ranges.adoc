= Date Range
:page-aliases: query-string-queries.adoc

You can perform date range searches by using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, followed by a date value in quotes.

For example, `created:>"2016-09-21"` will perform a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#date-range[date range query] on the `created` field for values after September 21, 2016.
