= Boosting the score 

When multiple query-clauses are specified, you can specify the relative importance a given clause by suffixing it with the ^ operator, followed by a number.

For example, description:pool name:pool^5 performs Match Queries for pool in both the name and description fields, but documents having the term in the name field score higher.
