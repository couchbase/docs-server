= Scatter Gather Operation

All available Search Service nodes in the cluster are individually searchable.

When one particular Search Service node is chosen for a search request, it assumes the role of _coordinator_; and is thereby responsible for applying the search request to the other Search Service nodes and for gathering and returning results.

The following illustration depicts this _scatter-gather_ execution of a search request:

This illustration shows how:

* The application makes a search request to a specific Search Service node (here, _Node 1_). This node assumes the role of coordinator.

* The coordinator scatters the search request to all other search-index partitions (here, _Node 2_ and _Node 3_) in the cluster.

* Once all the returned data is gathered, the coordinator applies filters as appropriate and returns the final results to the user.
