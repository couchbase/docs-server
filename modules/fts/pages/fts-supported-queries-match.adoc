= Match Query
:description: pass:q[A term without any other syntax is interpreted as a match query for the term in the default field. The default field is `_all`.]

{description}

For example, `pool` performs match query for the term `pool`.

A match query _analyzes_ input text and uses the results to query an index. Options include specifying an analyzer, performing a _fuzzy match_, and performing a _prefix match_.

By default, the analyzer used for the search text is what was set for the specified field during index creation. For information on analyzers, see xref:fts-using-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

NOTE: If the field is not specified, the match query will target the `_all` field within the index. Including content within the `_all` field is a setting during index creation.

When fuzzy matching is used, if the single parameter is set to a non-zero integer, the analyzed text is matched with a corresponding level of fuzziness. The maximum supported fuzziness is 2.

When a prefix match is used, the [.param]`prefix_length` parameter specifies that for a match to occur, a prefix of specified length must be shared by the input-term and the target text-element.

When an operator field is used, the [.param]`operator` decides the boolean logic used to interpret the text in the match field. 

For example, an operator value of `"and"` means the match query text would be treated like `location` AND `hostel`.  
The default operator value of `"or"` means the match query text would be treated like `location` OR `hostel`.

A match query is also demonstrated by means of the Java SDK, in xref:2.7@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].

== Example

The following JSON object demonstrates the specification of a match query:

[source,json]
----
{
 "match": "location hostel",
 "field": "reviews.content",
 "analyzer": "standard",
 "fuzziness": 2,
 "prefix_length": 4,
 "operator": "and"
}
