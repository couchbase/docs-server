= Document Type with single collection
:description: Every document in Couchbase includes the type field that represents the type of the document.

{description} For example, type “airport” represents the documents related to airport information.

If you want to search for a specific document type from a single collection, you can manually specify the document type after the collection in the Collection field.

For example, inventory.airline.airport or inventory.route.airport

Now, when you search for the airport document type, the index will display all documents from a single collection where the type field is airport.
