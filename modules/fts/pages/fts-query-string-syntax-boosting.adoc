[#Boosting]
= Boosting

When you specify multiple query-clauses, you can specify the relative importance to a given clause by suffixing it with the `^` operator, followed by a number or by specifying the `boost` parameter with the number to boost the search.

== Example

`description:pool name:pool^5`

The above syntax performs Match Queries for *pool* in both the `name` and `description` fields, but documents having the term in the `name` field score higher.

`"field":"city", "match": "glossop", "boost":5`
`field":"title", "match": "glossop"`

The above syntax performs Match Queries for a city *glossop* in both the `city` and `title` fields, but documents having the term in the `city` field score higher.
