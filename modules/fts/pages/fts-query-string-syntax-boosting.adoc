= Boosting Syntax

When you specify multiple query-clauses, you can specify the relative importance to a given clause by suffixing it with the `^` operator, followed by a number.

== Example

`description:pool name:pool^5`

The above syntax performs Match Queries for `pool` in both the `name` and `description` fields, but documents having the term in the `name` field score higher.
