= Delete Index

You can access the Full Text Indexes from the *Search* tab. Left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.)

To delete an index, left-click on its row. The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

* [.ui]*Delete* causes the current index to be deleted.
