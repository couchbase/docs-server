= Manage Index Lifecycle

Full Text Indexes, once created can be cloned, edited and/or deleted. They are accessed from the *Search* tab: left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.

(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.)

To manage an index, left-click on its row. The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

== Edit Index

* [.ui]*Edit* brings up the *Edit Index* screen, which allows the index to be modified. Saving modifications cause the index to be rebuilt.

"Quick Edit" that goes to the quick editor for an index definition also results in the same functionalities.

NOTE: Both the [.ui]*Edit Index* and [.ui]*Clone Index* screens are in most respects the same as the [.ui]*Add Index* screen, which was itself described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI].

== Delete Index

* [.ui]*Delete* causes the current index to be deleted. Index deletion is an asynchronous process in the background.

== Clone Index

* [.ui]*Clone* button click brings up the *Clone Index* screen, which allows a copy of the current index to be modified as appropriate and required, and saved under a new name.
