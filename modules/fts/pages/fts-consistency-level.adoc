= Consistency Level


== at_plus

Set consistency level to at_plus: When checked, bounded consistency is implemented for the query. The request includes a scan_vector parameter and value, which is used as a lower bound, allowing you to implement Read-Your-Own-Writes (RYOW). 

Specify the value of the scan_vector parameter in the Consistency Vectors field. For more information, refer to the page Understanding Queries in the Couchbase Server documentation.
