= Consistency Level

#What is consistency level? Need Information#

== at_plus

Executes the query, requiring indexes first to be updated to the timestamp of the last update. 

This implements bounded consistency. The request includes a scan_vector parameter and value, which is used as a lower bound. This can be used to implement read-your-own-writes (RYOW).

If index-maintenance is running behind, the query waits for it to catch up.

== not_bounded

Executes the query immediately, without requiring any consistency for the query. No timestamp vector is used in the index scan. 

This is the fastest mode, because it avoids the costs of obtaining the vector and waiting for the index to catch up to the vector.

If index-maintenance is running behind, out-of-date results may be returned.
