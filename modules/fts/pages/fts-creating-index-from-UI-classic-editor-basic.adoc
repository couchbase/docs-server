[abstract]
A classic editor is an advanced tool where users can directly configure the index mapping. 

This section introduces index creations via a step by step walk through using the classic editor.  The reader should be already familiar with the basic concepts of full-text search 

= Creating a Basic Index

This section describes creating and Index on a bucket's *_default* scope/collection.

To create a basic Search index on the _default collection, through the Classic Editor:

* Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click the *Add Index* link in the upper right.
+

* To define any index on which Full Text Search a unique name for the index in the *Index Name* field, on the upper-left. Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names and the first character of the name must be alphabetic. 
+
Enter *travel-sample-index* as the name of the Search index you are creating in the *Index Name* text-box.
+

* Select the bucket *travel-sample* from the *Bucket* pull-down menu.
+
Use the pull-down menu provided for the Bucket field, on the upper-right, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+

* Save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen.
+
This is all you need to specify in order to create a basic index for test and development. No further configuration is required.

* If you subsequently Edit your Index it should look like the following:

== Test the Basic Index with a simple query

In the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click on the index you just created (named "landmark-content-index") to expand the Index's controls.

* In the text area of the search box enter *+view +food +beach* this will search on all three keywords

* Click on the blue *Search* button. You will get documents from both type hotel and type landmark
+

* Verify you have some results

NOTE: Creating default indexes as above indexes across all fields is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.

= Full Text Search Screen / Other

Once you hit the  *Create Index* button you will return to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page (note, if you tested any index just access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page again).

At this point, you are returned to the Full Text Search screen. 

A new row now appears for the index you have just created. When left-clicked on, the row opens or expands as follows:

== Index Build Progress

Once the new index has been built, it supports Full Text Searches performed by all available means: the Console UI, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase SDK.

=== Statistic: docs processed

The percentage figure appears under the indexing progress column and represents the number of documents present in the index.  

* On an initial build this may take a while to process all the documents.  

* A mutation to an existing document will not increment this count (unless new items are added).

=== Statistic: indexing progress

The percentage figure appears under the indexing progress column and is incremented in correspondence with the build-progress of the index. When 100% is reached, the index build is complete. 

* However, search queries will be allowed as soon as the index is created, meaning partial results can be expected until the index build is complete.  

* If later mutations com in the percentage may actually jump around as batches of documents are processed.

* If one or more of the nodes in the cluster running data service goes down and/or are failed over, indexing progress may show a value > 100%.  

[#using-the-show-index-definition]
== Show Index Definition JSON

This expandable section shows the JSON document that describes the current index configuration, as created by means of the user interface.  

A checkbox *[ ]  Show curl command to modify this index definition" wrap the definition with a command line cURL syntax.  

You can copy either variant (the cURL mode) and the definitions can be used via the Search REST API or any Couchbase SDK.

[#using-the-index-definition-preview]
== Using the Index Definition Preview

The _Index Definition Preview_ appears to the right-hand side of the *Add Index* (or an *Edit Index*) screen.

Following index-definition, the upper portion may appear as follows:

[#fts_index_definition_preview]
image::fts-index-definition-preview.png[,,align=left]

This preview (like the *Show Index Definition JSON* from the main Search page) consists of the JSON document that describes the current index configuration, as created by means of the user interface.
By left-clicking on the [.ui]*copy to clipboard* tab, the definition can be saved.   

These definitions can be used via the Search REST API or any Couchbase SDK.

= Other Advanced Index Options

The *Creating a Basic Index* (this example) provides a simple introduction to using Search, however it is not optimized nor does it expose many useful features that the Search service supports.  This example only runs on the _default scope/collection and should be considered a legacy mode.

The *Creating an Advanced Index* section starts to introduce advanced feature for optimizing and using a Search index. This example does not cover adding multiple collections under a scope, adding multiple field or fields from sub-objects. 

The complete range of available options for creating  Search indexes for any production environment is covered here: xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
