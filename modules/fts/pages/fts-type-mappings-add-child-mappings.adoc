[#inserting-a-child-mapping]
= Add a Child Mapping

The option [.ui]*insert child mapping* specifies a document-field whose value is a JSON object.
Selecting this option displays the following:

The following interactive field and checkbox are displayed:

* [.ui]*{}*: The name of a field whose value is a JSON object.
Note that an analyzer for the field, by means of the pull-down menu.
* [.ui]*only index specified fields*: When checked, only fields explicitly specified are added to the index.
Note that the JSON object specified as the value for [.ui]*{}* has multiple fields of its own.
Checking this box ensures that all or a subset of these can be selected for indexing.

When completed, this panel might look as follows (note that `reviews` is a field within the `hotel`-type documents of the `travel-sample` bucket whose value is a JSON object):

[#fts_type_mappings_child_mapping_dialog_complete]

Save by left-clicking *OK*.
The field is now displayed as part of the `hotel` type mapping.
Note that by hovering over the `reviews` row with the mouse, the [.ui]*Edit* and [.ui]*&#43;* buttons are revealed: the [.ui]*&#43;* button is present because `reviews` is an object that contains child-fields; which can now themselves be individually indexed.
Left-click on this, and a child-field, such as `content`, can be specified:
