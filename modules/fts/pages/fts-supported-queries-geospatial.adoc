= Geospatial Queries

[abstract]
_Geospatial_ queries return documents that contain location in either legacy Geopoint format or standard GeoJSON structures.

== Geopoint (type geopoint)

Legacy or Geopoint documents which specify a geographical location. 

For these queries the Search service lets users index the single dimensional geopoint/location fields and perform various bounding queries like point-distance, bounded-rectangle and bounded-polygon against the indexed geopoint field.  

For higher level shapes and structures refer to GeoJSON below.

== GeoJSON (type geojson)
