= Geospatial Queries

[abstract]
_Geospatial_ queries return documents that contain location in either legacy Geopoint format or standard GeoJson

== Geopoint (type geopoint)

Legacy or Geopoint documents which specify a geographical location. 

For these queries the Search service lets the users index the single dimensional geopoint/location fields and perform various bounding queries like point-distance, bounded-rectangle and bounded-polygon against the indexed geopoint field.  But we know that geo-points alone wonâ€™t be effective in representing the various spatial details of real life shapes or structures.

== GeoJSON (type geojson)

For these queries the Search service supports higher dimensional spatial structures would enable the users to approximate a large variety of real life shapes like a postal or jurisdictional region boundaries, a route for a delivery vehicle or an airline career or the boundaries of various water bodies like a river, lake, stream etc. 

Search service now supports the GeoJSON spatial data formats on spherical geodesics in release 7.1.2.  This  enables users to address use cases like

- finding all the documents with any GeoJSON shapes that contain the query shape.
- finding all the documents with any GeoJSON shapes that reside within the query shape.
- finding all the documents with any GeoJSON shapes that intersect with the query shape.

And the supported GeoJSON shapes are:

- Point
- LineString
- Polygon
- MultiPoint
- MultiLineString
- MultiPolygon
- GeometryCollection

In addition to the above shapes, Search also supports a couple of additional custom shapes to make the spatial approximations easier for users to utilize.  The extra shapes supported are:

- Circle
- Envelope
