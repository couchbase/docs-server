:description: Facets are aggregate information collected on a particular result set.

[abstract]
{description}

In Facets, you already have a search in mind, and you want to collect additional facet information along with it.

All of the facet examples given in this topic are for the query "[.code]``water``" on the beer-sample dataset.

FTS supports the following types of facets:

* *Term Facet* - A term facet counts up how many of the matching documents have a particular term in a particular field.
Most of the time, this only makes sense for relatively low cardinality fields, like a type or tags.
It would not make sense to use it on a unique field like an ID.

* *Numeric Range Facet* - A numeric range facet works by the user defining their own buckets (numeric ranges).
The facet then counts how many of the matching documents fall into a particular bucket for a particular field.

* *Date Range Facet* - same as numeric, but on dates instead of numbers.
Full text search and Bleve expect dates to be in the format specified by https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt[RFC-3339^], which is a specific profile of ISO-8601 that is more restrictive.

NOTE: Most of the time, when building a term facet, you must use the keyword analyzer. Otherwise, multi-term values are tokenized, which might cause unexpected results.

== Example

* Term Facet - computes facet on the type field which has 2 values: `beer` and `brewery`.

* Numeric Range Facet - computes facet on the `abv` field with two buckets describing `high` (greater than 7) and `low` (less than 7).
