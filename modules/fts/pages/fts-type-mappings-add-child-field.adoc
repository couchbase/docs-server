= Add Child Field

The option [.ui]*insert child field* allows a field to be individually included for (or excluded from) indexing, provided that it contains a single value or an array rather than a JSON object.
Selecting this option displays the following:

[#fts_type_mappings_child_field_dialog]

The interactive fields and checkboxes are:

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-field-name.adoc[Field Name]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-field-type.adoc[Field Type]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-field-searchable-as.adoc[Field Searchable As]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-analyzer.adoc[Analyzer]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-index.adoc[Index]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-store.adoc[Store]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-include-term-vectors.adoc[Include term vectors]

** xref:fts-type-mappings-add-child-field-include-in-all-field.adoc[Include in _all field]



The dialog, when completed, might look as follows:

[#fts_type-mappings_child_field_dialog_complete]
image::fts-type-mappings-child-field-dialog-complete.png[,700,align=left]

Left-click on [.ui]*OK*.
The field is saved, and its principal attributes displayed on a new row:

[#fts_type-mappings_child_field_saved]
image::fts-type-mappings-child-field-saved.png[,700,align=left]

Note that when this row is hovered over with the mouse, an *Edit* button appears, whereby updates to the definition can be made.
