= Boolean Query

A _boolean query_ is a combination of conjunction and disjunction queries.
A boolean query takes three lists of queries:

* `must`: Result documents must satisfy all of these queries.
* `should`: Result documents should satisfy these queries.
* `must not`: Result documents must not satisfy any of these queries.
