= Accessing and Managing Full Text Indexes

[abstract]
Full Text indexes, which are available under the *Indexes* tab of the Couchbase Web Console, are another form of the index provided by the Search service.

Full Text indexes are special-purpose indexes that contain targets derived from the textual contents of the documents within one or more buckets or collections from the buckets.
For more information about different types of indexes, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/indexes.adoc[Indexes].

Full Text Indexes are accessed from the *Search* tab: left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.) To manage an index, left-click on its row.
The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

Three buttons are displayed:

* [.ui]*Delete* causes the current index to be deleted.
* [.ui]*Clone* brings up the *Clone Index* screen, which allows a copy of the current index to be modified as appropriate and saved under a new name.
* [.ui]*Edit* brings up the *Edit Index* screen, which allows the index to be modified.
Saving modifications causes the index to be rebuilt.

Note that both the [.ui]*Edit Index* and [.ui]*Clone Index* screens are in most respects the same as the [.ui]*Add Index* screen, which was itself described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI].
