= Accessing and Managing Full Text Indexes

[abstract]
Full Text Indexes are different from the _Global_ indexes that are accessed under the *Indexes* tab in the left-hand navigation panel of the Couchbase Web Console.

Full Text Indexes are accessed from the *Search* tab: left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.) To manage an index, left-click on its row.
The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

Three buttons are displayed:

* [.ui]*Delete* causes the current index to be deleted.
* [.ui]*Clone* brings up the *Clone Index* screen, which allows a copy of the current index to be modified as appropriate and saved under a new name.
* [.ui]*Edit* brings up the *Edit Index* screen, which allows the index to be modified.
Saving modifications causes the index to be rebuilt.

Note that both the [.ui]*Edit Index* and [.ui]*Clone Index* screens are in most respects the same as the [.ui]*Add Index* screen, which was itself described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI].
