= Accessing and Managing Full Text Indexes

[abstract]
Full Text indexes are available under the *Search* tab of the Couchbase Web Console.

These indexes analyze and store tokens from text, numeric, geo, boolean, datetime fields within JSON documents obtained from couchbase buckets/collections.

For more information about different types of indexes, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/indexes.adoc[Indexes].

Full Text Indexes are accessed from the *Search* tab: left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.) To manage an index, left-click on its row.
The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

Three buttons are displayed:

* [.ui]*Delete* causes the current index to be deleted.
* [.ui]*Clone* brings up the *Clone Index* screen, which allows a copy of the current index to be modified as appropriate and saved under a new name.
* [.ui]*Edit* brings up the *Edit Index* screen, which allows the index to be modified.

Modifying the index definition can cause indexes to be rebuilt.
"Quick Edit" that goes to the quick editor for an index definition also results in same.

Note that both the [.ui]*Edit Index* and [.ui]*Clone Index* screens are in most respects the same as the [.ui]*Add Index* screen, which was itself described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI].

Users have an option to update the index definition whenever they need to change properties of the index related to type mappings, partitions, replicas, storage, or persistence.

While updating an index definition, note that a few of the update would result in the rebuild of the index from scratch.

== Index Rebuilding Updates 

Any type of mapping or partition count-related updates always rebuilds the index.

So these changes would affect the live traffic. But usually, these types of index definition updates happen towards the early deployment phase of the cluster.

== Non-Rebuilding Updates

The remaining index property updates would be instantaneous. Updates would only result in a restart or refresh of the underlying components. 

The index should be up and running within a down period of only a few seconds. Hence users may try these during the non-peak traffic hours.

Index definition updates like changing the replica counts, storage engine properties belong to this category.
