= Searching from the UI

[abstract]
Full Text Search can be performed from the Couchbase Web Console.

[#fts-quick-start]
== Access the Full Text Search User Interface

The user interface for Full Text Search is provided by the Couchbase Web Console.
In order to proceed, you must have permission to log into the console, create indexes, and perform searches.
For information on _Role-Based Access Control_, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

The example provided in this section assumes that you have also loaded the `travel-sample` bucket: you will perform your Full Text Search operations on the data in this bucket.
For instructions on how to load this sample bucket, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

Once you have the appropriate credentials, and have loaded the `travel-sample` bucket, access the Couchbase Web Console by typing `+http://localhost:8091+` into the address-field at the top of your browser, and then hitting return.
The login screen appears as follows:

[#fts_login_screen]
image::fts-login-screen.png[,280,align=left]

Enter your username and password, and left-click on the *Sign In* button.
The Couchbase Web Console now appears, with the *Dashboard* for the cluster displayed:

[#fts_console_initial]
image::fts-console-initial.png[,720,align=left]

Note that the appearance of the main panel of the *Dashboard* varies, in accordance with customizations that have been performed.
For information, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].

To access the *Full Text Search* screen, left-click on the *Search* tab, in the navigation bar at the left-hand side:

[#fts_select_search_tab]
image::fts-select-search-tab.png[,82,align=left]

The *Full Text Search* screen now appears, as follows:

[#fts_fts_console_initial]
image::fts-fts-console-initial.png[,720,align=left]

The console contains areas for the display of _indexes_ and _aliases_: but both are empty, since none has yet been created.

== Create an Index

To create an index, left-click on the *Add Index* button, towards the right-hand side:

[#fts_add_index_button]
image::fts-add-index-button.png[,120,align=left]

The *Add Index* screen appears:

[#fts_add_index_initial]
image::fts-add-index-initial.png[,320,align=left]

To define a basic index on which Full Text Search can be performed, begin by entering a unique name for the index into the *Name* field, at the upper-left: for example, `travel-sample-index`.
(Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names.
Note also that the first character of the name must be an alphabetic character.) Then, use the pull-down menu provided for the *Bucket* field, at the upper-right, to specify the `travel-sample` bucket:

[#fts_index_name_and_bucket]
image::fts-index-name-and-bucket.png[,400,align=left]

This is all you need to specify, in order to create a basic index for test and development.
No further configuration is required.
Note, however, that such _default indexing_ is not recommended for production environments, since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.
To review the wide range of available options for creating indexes appropriate for production environments, see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

To save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button, near the bottom of the screen:

[#fts_create_index_button]
image::fts-create-index-button.png[,120,align=left]

At this point, you are returned to the *Full Text Search* screen.
A row now appears, in the *Full Text Indexes* panel, for the index you have created.
When left-clicked on, the row opens as follows:

[#fts_new_index-progress]
image::fts-new-index-progress.png[,640,align=left]

Note the percentage figure: this appears under the *indexing progress* column, and is incremented in correspondence with the build-progress of the index.
When 100% is reached, the index build is said to be complete. Search queries will however be allowed as soon as the index is created, meaning partial results can be expected until the index build is complete.

Once the new index has been built, it supports Full Text Searches performed by all available means: the Console UI, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase SDK.

The *indexing progress* is determined as index_doc_count / source_doc_count. While index_doc_count is retrieved from search endpoint, source_doc_count is retrieved from a KV endpoint. In the event where one or more of the nodes in the cluster running data service go down and/or are failed over, *indexing progress* may show a value > 100% as the source_doc_count for the bucket would be missing some active partitions.

== Perform a Query

To perform a query, simply type a term into the interactive text-field that appears to the left of the *Search* button on the row for the index you have created.
For example, `restaurant`.
Then, left-click on the *Search* button:

[#fts_ui_search_for_term]
image::fts-ui-search-for-term.png[,320,align=left]

A *Search Results* page now appears, featuring documents that contain the specified term:

[#fts_ui_search_results_page]
image::fts-ui-search-results-page.png[,580,align=left]

By left-clicking on any of the displayed document IDs, you bring up a display that features the entire contents of the document.

== Advanced Settings and Other Features

On the *Search Results* page, to the immediate right of the *Search* button, at the top of the screen, appears the *show advanced query settings* checkbox.
Check this to display the advanced settings:

[#fts_advanced_query_settings]
image::fts-advanced-query-settings.png[,680,align=left]

Three interactive text-fields now appear underneath the *Search* panel: *Timeout (msecs)*, *Consistency Level*, and *Consistency Vector*.
Additionally, the *JSON for Query Request* panel displays the submitted query in JSON format.
Note the *show command-line curl example* checbox, which when checked, adds to the initial JSON display, to form a completed curl command:

[#fts_ui_curl_exammple]
image::fts-ui-curl-example.png[,520,align=left]

This example can be copied by means of the *Copy to Clipboard* button, pasted (for example) into a standard console-window, and executed against the prompt.
This feature therefore provides a useful means of extending experiments initially performed with the UI into a subsequent console-based, script-based, or program-based context.
(Note, however, that the addition of credentials for authentication are required for execution of the statement outside the context of the current session within Couchbase Web Console.
See xref:fts-searching-with-the-rest-api.adoc[Searching with the REST API] for an example.)

Note also the *Show Scoring* checkbox that appears prior to the entries in the *Results for travel-sample-index* panel.
When this is checked, scores for each document in the list are provided.
For example:

[#fts_ui_query_scores_display]
image::fts-ui-query-scores-display.png[,520,align=left]

Finally, note the *full text query syntax help* link that now appears under the *Search* interactive text-field:

[#fts_query_syntax_help_linke]
image::fts-query-syntax-help-link.png[,360,align=left]

This link takes the user to the documentation on xref:query-string-queries.adoc[Query String Queries].
Such a query can be specified in the *Search* interactive text-field, thereby allowing a search of considerable complexity to be accomplished within Couchbase Web Console.

Note that a Query String Query is the _only_ type of query that can be executed by means of this field.

For more information, see xref:query-string-queries.adoc[Query String Queries].
