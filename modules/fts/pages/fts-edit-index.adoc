= Edit Index

You can access the Full Text Indexes from the *Search* tab. Left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.)

To edit an index, left-click on its row. The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

* [.ui]*Edit* brings up the *Edit Index* screen, which allows the index to be modified. Saving modifications cause the index to be rebuilt.

"Quick Edit" that goes to the quick editor for an index definition also results in the same functionalities.
