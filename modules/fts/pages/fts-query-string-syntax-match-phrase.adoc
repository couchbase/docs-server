= Match Phrases

Placing the search terms in quotes performs a match phrase query. 

This query searches for terms in the target that occur in the positions and offsets indicated by the input: this depends on _term_vectors_, which must have been included in the creation of the index used for the search.

For example, `"continental breakfast"` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-phrase-query[match phrase query] for the phrase `continental breakfast`.
