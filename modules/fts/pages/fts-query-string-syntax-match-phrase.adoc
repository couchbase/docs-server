[#Match-Phrase]
= Match Phrase

Placing the search terms in quotes performs a match phrase query. 

This query searches for terms in the target that occur in the positions and offsets indicated by the input: this depends on _term_vectors_, which must have been included in the creation of the index used for the search.

== Example

`"continental breakfast"` performs a xref:fts-supported-queries-match-phrase.adoc[match phrase query] for the phrase `continental breakfast`.
