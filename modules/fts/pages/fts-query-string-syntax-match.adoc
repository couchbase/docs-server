= Match Query Syntax

A term without any other syntax is interpreted as a match query for the term in the default field.

The default field is `_all`.

For example, `pool` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-query[match query] for the term `pool`.

== Example

The following JSON object demonstrates specification of a match query:

{
 "match": "location hostel",
 "field": "reviews.content",
 "analyzer": "standard",
 "fuzziness": 2,
 "prefix_length": 4,
 "operator": "and"
}
