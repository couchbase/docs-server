= Match Query Syntax

A term without any other syntax is interpreted as a match query for the term in the default field.

The default field is `_all`.

== Example

`pool` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-query[match query] for the term `pool`.

The following JSON object demonstrates specification of a match query:
