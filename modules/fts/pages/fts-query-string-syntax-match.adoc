[#Match-Query]
= Match Query Syntax

A term without any other syntax is interpreted as a match query for the term in the default field.

The default field is `_all`.

For example, `pool` performs a xref:fts-supported-queries-match.adoc[match query] for the term `pool`.

== Example

The following JSON object demonstrates specification of a match query:
