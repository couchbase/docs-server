= Query String Queries

[abstract]
Query strings enable humans to describe complex queries using a simple syntax.

Using the query string syntax, the following query types can be performed:

== Match

A term without any other syntax is interpreted as a match query for the term in the default field.
The default field is `_all`.

For example, `pool` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-query[match query] for the term `pool`.

== Match Phrases

Placing the search terms in quotes performs a match phrase query.

For example, `"continental breakfast"` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-phrase-query[match phrase query] for the phrase `continental breakfast`.

== Field Scoping

You can specify the field in which to search by prefixing the term with a field-name, separated by a colon.

The field-name may be a path to a field, using dot notation.
The path must use Search syntax rather than N1QL syntax; in other words, you cannot specify array locations such as `[*]` or `[3]` in the path.

For example, `description:pool` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#match-query[match query] for the term `pool`, in the `description` field.

== Required, Optional, and Exclusion

When a query string includes multiple items, by default these are placed into the SHOULD clause of a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#boolean-query[boolean query].
You can adjust this by prefixing items with `+` or `-`.

* Prefixing with `+` places that item in the MUST portion of the boolean query.
* Prefixing with `-` places that item in the MUST NOT portion of the boolean query.

For example, `+description:pool -continental breakfast` performs a boolean query that MUST satisfy the match query for the term `pool` in the `description` field, MUST NOT satisfy the match query for the term `continental` in the `default` field, and SHOULD satisfy the match query for the term `breakfast` in the `default` field.
Result documents satisfying the SHOULD clause score higher than those that do not.

== Boosting

When multiple query-clauses are specified, you can specify the relative importance a given clause by suffixing it with the `^` operator, followed by a number.

For example, `description:pool name:pool^5` performs Match Queries for `pool` in both the `name` and `description` fields, but documents having the term in the `name` field score higher.

== Numeric Ranges

You can specify numeric ranges with the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, each followed by a numeric value.

For example, `reviews.ratings.Cleanliness:>4` performs a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#numeric-range[numeric range query] on the `reviews.ratings.Cleanliness` field, for values greater than 4.

== Date Ranges

You can perform date range searches by using the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, followed by a date value in quotes.

For example, `created:>"2016-09-21"` will perform a xref:fts-query-types.adoc#date-range[date range query] on the `created` field for values after September 21, 2016.

== Escaping

The following quoted string enumerates the characters which may be escaped:

----
"+-=&|><!(){}[]^\"~*?:\\/ "
----

NOTE: This list contains the space character.

In order to escape these characters, they are prefixed with the `\` (backslash) character.
In all cases, using the escaped version produces the character itself and is not interpreted by the lexer.

For example:

* `my\ name` is interpreted as a single argument to a match query with the value "my name".
* `"contains a\" character"` is interpreted as a single argument to a phrase query with the value `contains a " character`.
