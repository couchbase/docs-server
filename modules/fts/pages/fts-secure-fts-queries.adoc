= Secure Queries Using SSL

== Secure FTS queries using SSL
For querying, the user has to use https and the SSL port (18094), for example,
----
curl -XPOST ... https://<ip>:18094/api/index/{indexName}/query ...
----

The user needs to provide the username, password (-u).
 
For information on using cURL in N1QL, see this https://blog.couchbase.com/developer-release-curl-n1ql/[blog^].

The curl function takes up to three parameters:

1. The first parameter is the HTTP verb used. So far, we support “GET” and “POST”.
2. The second parameter is the endpoint URL.
3. The third parameter represents different cURL options.
