= Creating Analyzers
Analyzers increase search-awareness by transforming input text into token-streams, which permit the management of richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching. 

An analyzer consists of modules, each of which performs a particular role in the transformation (for example, removing undesirable characters, transforming standard words into stemmed or otherwise modified forms, referred to as tokens, and performing miscellaneous post-processing activities).

For more information on analyzers, see 
xref:fts-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

A default selection of analyzers is made available from the pull-down menu provided by the *Type Mappings* interface discussed above. Additional analyzers can be custom-created, by means of the *Analyzers* panel, which appears as follows:

To create a new analyzer, left-click on the *+ Add Analyzer* button.

The *Custom Analyzer* dialog appears:

[#fts_custom_analyzer_dialog_initial]
image::fts_custom_analyzer_dialog_initial.png[,700,align=left]

The dialog contains four interactive panels.

* *Name:* A suitable, user-defined name for the analyzer.

* *Character Filters:* One or more available character filters. (These strip out undesirable characters from input: for example, the `html` character filter removes HTML tags, and indexes HTML text-content alone.) To select from the list of available character filters, use the pull-down menu:

[#fts_custom_analyzer_panel_select_char_filter]
image::fts_custom_analyzer_panel_select_char_filter.png[,700,align=left]

Following addition of one character filter, to add another, left-click on the *+ Add* button, to the right of the field.

For an explanation of character filters, see the section in xref:fts-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

* *Tokenizer:* One of the available tokenizers. (These split input-strings into individual tokens, which together are made into a token stream. Typically, a token is established for each word.) The default value is `unicode`. To select from a list of all tokenizers available, use the pull-down menu:

[#fts_add_tokenizer_pulldown]
image::fts_add_tokenizer_pulldown.png[,700,align=left]

For more information on tokenizers, see the section in xref:fts-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

* *Token Filter:* One or more of the available token filters. (When specified, these are chained together, to perform additional post-processing on the token stream.) To select from the list of available filters, use the pull-down menu:

[#fts_analyzers_panel_select_token_filter]
image::fts_analyzers_panel_select_token_filter.png[,700,align=left]

Following addition of one token filter, to add another, left-click on the *+ Add* button, to the right of the field.

For more information on token filters, see the section in xref:fts-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

When these fields have been appropriately completed, save; by left-clicking on the *Save* button. On the *Edit Index* screen, the newly defined analyzer now appears in the *Analyzers* panel, with available options displayed for further editing, and deleting. For example:
