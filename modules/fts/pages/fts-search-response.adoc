= Search response

[abstract]
Full Text Search provides a response object, which contains detailed information on the results of the search query. 

A Full Text Search Response Object is composed of multiple child-objects, each of which provides important information. Prior to the search, a facet can be added to the response object, and information on aggregations thereby returned.
