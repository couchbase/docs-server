== The Differences

* The Classic Editor

** Exposes the most advanced creation tool in which users directly configure the full range of index mapping options.

** Intended for power users who are already familiar with the concepts of full-text search.

* The Quick Editor

** The Quick Editor allows users to configure the mapping by working with sample documents and higher-level abstractions.

** The Quick Editor it does not support all of the advanced options of the Classic Editor.

** The Quick Editor is intended for new users who are still learning about full-text search.

* The Search REST API 

** Allows users to instantly configure indexes via JSON payloads.

** Good for exporting, importing, and porting Search index definitions.

** Complex syntax typically precludes editing outside of one of the UI editors.
