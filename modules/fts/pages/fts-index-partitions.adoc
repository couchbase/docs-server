= Index Partitioning

_Index Partitioning_ increases query performance by dividing and spreading a large index of documents across multiple nodes. This feature is available only in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

The benefits include:

* The ability to scale out horizontally as index size increases.

* Transparency to queries, requiring no change to existing queries.

* Reduction of query latency for large, aggregated queries; since partitions can be scanned in parallel.

* Provision of a low-latency range query while allowing indexes to be scaled out as needed.

For detailed information, refer to {index-partitioning}[Index Partitioning].
