= Numeric Range Query

A _numeric range_ query finds documents containing a numeric value in the specified field within the specified range.

Define the endpoints using the fields [.param]`min` and [.param]`max`.
You can omit any one endpoint, but not both.

The [.param]`inclusive_min` and [.param]`inclusive_max` properties control whether or not the endpoints are included or excluded.

By default, [.param]`min` is inclusive and [.param]`max` is exclusive.

A numeric range Query is also demonstrated by means of the Java SDK, in xref:2.7@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].

=== Example

[source,json]
----
{
 "min": 100, "max": 1000,
 "inclusive_min": false,
 "inclusive_max": false,
 "field": "id"
}
----

== Numeric Ranges

You can specify numeric ranges with the `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `\<=` operators, each followed by a numeric value.

=== Example

[source,json]
----
`reviews.ratings.Cleanliness:>4` 
----

The above qeury performs numeric range query on the `reviews.ratings.Cleanliness` field, for values greater than 4.
