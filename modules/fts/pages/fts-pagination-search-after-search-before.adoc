= search_after, search_before

For efficient pagination you can use the `search_after/search_before` settings.

`search_after` is designed to fetch the `size` number of results after the key specified and `search_before` is designed to fetch the `size` number of results before the key specified.

These settings allow for the client to maintain state while paginating - the sort key of the last result (for search_after) or the first result (for search_before) in the current page.

Both the attributes accept an array of strings (sort keys) - the length of this array will need to be the same length of the "sort" array within the search request.

NOTE: You cannot use both `search_after` and `search_before` in the same search request.

== Example

Here are some examples using `search_after/search_before` over sort key "_id" (an internal field that carries the document ID).

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "sort": ["_id"],
  "search_after": ["hotel_10180"],
  "size": 3
}
----

----
{
  "query": {
      "match": "California",
      "field": "state"
  },
  "sort": ["_id"],
  "search_before": ["hotel_17595"],
  "size": 4
}
----

NOTE: A Full Text Search request that doesn't carry any pagination settings will return the first 10 results (`"size: 10", "from": 0`) ordered by _score_ sequentially from the highest to lowest.
