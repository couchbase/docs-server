= Default Analyzer

This is the default analyzer to be used.
The default value is `standard`.

The default analyzer is applicable to all the text fields across type mappings unless explicitly overridden.

It is the _standard_ analyzer in which analysis is done by the means of the Unicode tokenizer, the to_lower token filter, and the stop token filter.
