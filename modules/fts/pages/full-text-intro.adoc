= Full Text Search: Fundamentals

[abstract]
_Full Text Search_ (FTS) lets you create, manage, and query specially purposed _indexes_, defined on JSON documents within a Couchbase bucket.

== Features of Full Text Search

_Full Text Search_ provides extensive capabilities for natural-language querying.
These include:

* _Language-aware_ searching; allowing users to search for, say, the word `beauties`, and additionally obtain results for `beauty` and `beautiful`.
* _Scoring_ of results, according to relevancy; allowing users to obtain result-sets that only contain documents awarded the highest scores.
This keeps result-sets manageably small, even when the total number of documents returned is extremely large.
* _Fast indexes_, which support a wide range of possible text-searches.

Full Text Search is powered by http://www.blevesearch.com/[Bleve^], an open source search and indexing library written in _Go_.
Full Text Search uses Bleve for the indexing of documents, and also makes available Bleveâ€™s extensive range of _query types_.
These include:

* _Match_, _Match Phrase_, _Doc ID_, and _Prefix_ queries
* _Conjunction_, _Disjunction_, and _Boolean field_ queries
* _Numeric Range_ and _Date Range_ queries
* _Geospatial_ queries
* _Query String_ queries, which employ a special syntax to express the details of each query (see xref:fts-query-types.adoc#query-string-query-syntax[Query String Query] for information)

Full Text Search includes pre-built _text analyzers_ for the following languages: Arabic, CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), English, French, Hindi, Italian, Kurdish, Persian, and Portuguese.
Additional languages have been added to Couchbase Server 5.5.

== Authorization for Full Text Search

To access Full Text Search, users require appropriate _roles_.
The role *FTS Admin* must therefore be assigned to those who intend to create indexes; and the role *FTS Searcher* to those who intend to perform searches.
For information on creating users and assigning roles, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
