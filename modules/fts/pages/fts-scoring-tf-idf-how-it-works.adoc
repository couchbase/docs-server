= tf-idf

[abstract]
`tf-idf`, a short form of *term frequency-inverse document frequency*, is a numerical statistical value that is used to reflect how important a word is to a document in collection or scope. 

`tf-idf` is used as a weighting factor in a search for information retrieval and text mining. The `tfâ€“idf` value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, and it is offset by the number of documents in the collection or scope that contains the word.

Search engines often use the variations of `tf-idf` weighting scheme as a tool in scoring and ranking a document's relevance for a given query.

When bleve scores a document, it sums a set of sub scores to reach the final score. The scores across different searches are not directly comparable as the search query is also an input factor to the scoring function.

The more conjuncts/disjuncts/sub clauses in a query can influence the scoring. Also, the score of a particular search result is not absolute, which means you can only use the score as a comparison to the highest score from the same search result. 

FTS does not provide any predefined range for valid scores.

In Couchbase application, you get an option to explore the score computations during any search in FTS.

On the Search page, you can search for a term in any index. The search result displays the search records along with the option *Explain Scoring* to view the score deriving details for search hits and which are determined by using the `tf-idf` algorithm.
