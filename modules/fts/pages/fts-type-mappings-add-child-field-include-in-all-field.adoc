= Child Field - Include in all field: 
:page-aliases: creating-indexes.adoc

When checked, the field is included in the definition of [.ui]*&#95;all*, which is the field specified by default in the [.ui]*Advanced* panel.
When unchecked, the field is not included.

Inclusion means that when _query strings_ are used to specify searches, the text in the current field is searchable without the field-name requiring a prefix (thus, a search on `description:modern` can be accomplished simply by specifying `modern`).
