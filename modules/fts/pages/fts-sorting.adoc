= Sorting Query Results

[abstract]
The results of Full Text Searches are returned as objects, the data within which can be sorted.

== Sorting Result Data

On query-completion, _sorting_ allows specified members of the result-set to be displayed prior to others: this facilitates review of the most significant data.

Within a JSON query object, the required sort-type is specified by using the `sort` field.
This takes, as its value, an array of either _strings_ or _objects_.

== Sorting with Strings

The value of the `sort` field can be specified as an array of strings.
These can be of three types:

* _field name_: Specifies the name of a field.
If multiple fields are included in the array, the sorting of documents begins according to their values for the field whose name is first in the array.
If any number of these values are identical, their documents are sorted again, this time according to their values for the field whose name is second; then, if any number of these values are identical, their documents are sorted a third time, this time according to their values for the field whose name is third; and so on.
+
Any document-field may be specified to hold the value on which sorting is to be based, provided that the field has been indexed in some way, whether dynamically or specifically.
+
The default sort-order is _ascending_.
If a field-name is prefixed with the `-` character, that field's results are sorted in _descending_ order.

* `_id`: Refers to the document identifier.
Whenever encountered in the array, causes sorting to occur by document identifer.
* `_score`: Refers to the score assigned the document in the result-set.
Whenever encountered in the array, causes sorting to occur by score.

For example:

----
"sort": ["country", "state", "city","-_score"]
----

This `sort` statement specifies that results will first be sorted by `country`.
If some documents are then found to have the same value in their `country` fields, they are re-sorted by `state`.
Next, if some of these documents are found to have the same value in their `state` fields, they are re-sorted by `city`.
Finally, if some of these documents are found to have the same value in their `city` fields, they are re-sorted by `score`, in _descending_ order.

The following JSON query demonstrates how and where the `sort` property can be specified:

----
{
  "explain": false,
  "fields": [
    "title"
  ],
  "highlight": {},
  "sort": ["country", "-_score","-_id"],
  "query":{
    "query": "beautiful pool"
  }
}

== Sorting with Objects

Fine-grained control over sort-procedure can be achieved by specifying _objects_ as array-values in the `sort` field.
Each object can have the following fields:

* `by`: Sorts results on `id`, `score`, or a specified `field` in the Full Text Index.

* `field`: Specifies the name of a field on which to sort.
Used only if `field` has been specified as the value for the `by` field; otherwise ignored.

* `missing`: Specifies the sort-procedure for documents with a missing value in a field specified for sorting.
The value of `missing` can be `first`, in which case results with missing values appear _before_ other results; or `last` (the default), in which case they appear _after_.

* `mode`: Specifies the search-order for index-fields that contain multiple values (in consequence of arrays or multi-token analyzer-output).
The `default` order is undefined but deterministic, allowing the paging of results from `from (_offset_)`, with reliable ordering.
To sort using the minimum or maximum value, the value of `mode` should be set to either `min` or `max`.

* `type`: Specifies the type of the search-order field value. 
For example, `string` for text fields, `date` for datetime fields, or `number` for numeric/geo fields.

To fetch more accurate sort results, we strongly recommend specifying the `type` of the sort fields 
in sort section of the search request.

The example below shows how an object-sort can be specified.
It assumes that the `travel-sample` bucket has been loaded, and a default index has been created on it.
This query sorts search-results based on `reviews.ratings.Overall` — a field that is normally multi-valued, because it contains an array of different users' ratings.
When there are multiple values, the highest `Overall` ratings are used for sorting.
Hotels with no `Overall` rating are placed at the end.

{
  "explain": false,
  "fields": [
     "*"
   ],
   "highlight": {},
   "query": {
     "match": "bathrobes",
     "field": "reviews.content",
     "analyzer": "standard"
   },
   "size" : 10,
   "sort": [
      {
       "by" : "field",
       "field" : "reviews.ratings.Overall",
       "mode" : "max",
       "missing" : "last",
       "type": "number"
      }
   ]
}

Note also that `sort` field accepts _combinations_ of strings and objects as its value.
This is demonstrated as follows:

----
{
   ...
   "sort": [
      "country",
      {
       "by" : "field",
       "field" : "reviews.ratings.Overall",
       "mode" : "max",
       "missing" : "last",
        "type": "number"
      },
      {
       "by" : "field",
       "field" : "reviews.ratings.Location",
       "mode" : "max",
       "missing" : "last",
       "type": "number"
      },
      "-_score"
   ]
}

== Tips for Sorting with fields.

When you sort results on a field that isn’t indexed, or when a particular document is missing a value for that field, you will see the following series of Unicode non-printable characters appear in the sort field: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. The same characters may render differently when using a graphic tool or command line tools like jq.

----
      "sort": [
        "����������",
        "hotel_9723",
        "_score"
      ]
----

Check your index definition to confirm that you’re indexing all the fields you intend to sort by. You can control the sort behavior for missing attributes using the missing field.
