= Sorting Query Results

[abstract]
The FTS results are returned as objects. FTS query includes options to order the results.

== Sorting Result Data

FTS sorting is sorted by descending order of relevance.  It can , however, be customized to sort by different fields, depending on the application. 

On query-completion, _sorting_ allows specified members of the result-set to be displayed prior to others: this facilitates a review of the most significant data.

Within a JSON query object, the required sort-type is specified by using the `sort` field.

This takes an array of either _strings_, _objects_, or _numeric_ as its value.
