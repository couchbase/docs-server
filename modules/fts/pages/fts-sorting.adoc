= Sorting Query Results

[abstract]
The results of Full Text Searches are returned as objects, the data within which can be sorted.

== Sorting Result Data

On query-completion, _sorting_ allows specified members of the result-set to be displayed prior to others: this facilitates review of the most significant data.

Within a JSON query object, the required sort-type is specified by using the `sort` field.

This takes, as its value, an array of either _strings_, _objects_, or _numeric_.
