== Status

The status object includes the number of successful and failed partition indexes queries.

We recommend that the status object be checked for failures as a preferred alternative to relying on HTTP response codes alone.
For example, FTS returns an HTTP 200 response in case of partition index failures or timeouts (not consistency timeouts). This is done so that you can choose to accept partial results in an application.
However, this also means FTS returns an HTTP 200 response even when ALL partition indexes fail.

Refer to the following table for more information about the possible status messages.

.Response Object Status Values
|===
| Status | Description

| HTTP 400
| Returned when an error is detected when validating the inputs.
The text error message accompanying the status describes the problem.

| HTTP 412
| Returned when the consistency requirements are not satisfied within the specified timeout.
The JSON structure accompanying the status provides information about the current consistency levels.

| HTTP 200
| Returned when an error is detected during query execution.
The errors might be contained in the JSON section named "status".

Total::
The `total` field returns an integer representing the total number of partition indexes queried.
This value varies depending on how your index is configured, the platform you are running on, and whether you are querying an index or an index alias.
Each index has a setting for the number of vBuckets per pindex.
For example, when running on a cluster with 1024 vBuckets and with an index setting of 171 vBuckets per pindex, the total number of partition indexes is 6.
When you query an index alias, `total` is the sum of all the partition indexes in each index that is included in the definition of the index alias.

Successful::
This field returns the total number of partition indexes successfully queried.
This integer value can range from 0 to the total number of partition indexes.

.Example Status: Successful
----
 "status": {
     "total": 6,
     "failed": 0,
     "successful": 6
},
----

Failed::
This field returns the total number of partition indexes with failed queries.
This integer value can range from 0 to the total number of partition indexes.
If the number is greater than 0, the response object contains an `errors` array.

Errors::
This field returns an array of error messages as reported by individual partition indexes.
This array only appears if the field "failed" is greater than 0.
