= Multi-Collection Behaviour

Couchbase's FTS service is the only service that can create indexes that span collections.
 
Multi-Collection Index: A user can search multi-collection indexes in the same way as that of a bucket-based index. Since a multi-collection index contains data from multiple source collections, it is helpful to know the source collection of every document xref:fts-search-response-hits.adoc[hit] in the search result.
 
* Users can see the source collection names in the fields section of each document xref:fts-search-response-hits.adoc[hit] under the key _$c. See the image below for an example.

* Users can also narrow their full-text search requests to only specific Collection(s) within the multi-Collection index. This focus speeds up searches on a large index.

Below is a sample Collection search request for Collections "airport".

*Example*
[source,console]
----
curl -XPOST -H “Content-Type:application/json” - u 
<username>:<password> http://localhost:8094/api/index/demoindex/query -d

‘{
  “explain”: true,
  “fields”:[
  “*” 
  ],
  “highlight”:{},
  “query”:{
    “query”:”france”
  },
  “size”:10,
  “from”:50,
  “collections”:[“airport”]
}’
----

* At search time, there is no validation to determine whether or not a collection with a given name exists. As a result, users won’t receive any validation errors for the incorrect collection names within the search request.
See the below example:

*Example*

An incorrect collection name “XYZ” is used. 

[source,console]
----

curl -XPOST -H “Content-Type:application/json” - u 
<username>:<password> http://localhost:8094/api/index/demoindex/query -d
‘{
“query”:{
“query”:”france”
},
“size”:10,
“from”:50,
“collections”:[“XYZ”]
}’
----

== Impact of using Role-Based Access Control

The Couchbase Full Admin can administer Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles for full-text search indexes at a Bucket, Scope, or Collection(s) level.

FTS provides two primary roles for managing the access control:

* xref:learn:security/roles.adoc#search-admin[Search Admin]
* xref:learn:security/roles.adoc#search-reader[Search Reader]
   
A user must have at least search reader permissions at the source Bucket or Scope or Collection level to access the FTS index.

NOTE: With multi-collection indexes, the user must have search reader roles for all source collections in order to access a multi-collection index.

== Data lifecycle impact 

Multi-collection indexes are deleted when any of the corresponding source collections are deleted. Therefore, multi-collection indexes are best suited for collections with similar data lifespans.
