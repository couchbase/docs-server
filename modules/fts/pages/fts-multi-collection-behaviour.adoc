= Multiple Collection Behaviour

Couchbase's Full Text Search service is the only Couchbase service that can create indexes that span collections.

The result set of a query that references a multi-collection index returns the collection names alongside the document ID, making it easy for users to identify which collection a document belongs to.
 
//ADD a query example 
 
Users can issue collection(s) scoped queries against a multi-collection index. During search time, no validation is made to check whether the given collection names actually exist. As a result users wonâ€™t receive any validation errors for the invalid/incorrect collection(s) names within the search request.
