[#term-facet]
= Term Facet

A term facet counts up how many of the matching documents have a particular term in a particular field.

Most of the time this only makes sense for relatively low cardinality fields, like a type or tags. It would not make sense to use it on a unique field like an ID.

NOTE: When building a term facet, use the keyword analyzer. Otherwise multi-term values get tokenized and you cannot see the expected results.

== Example

* Term Facet - computes facet on the type field which has 2 values: `beer` and `brewery`.
