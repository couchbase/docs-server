= Specifying Type Mapping for Collection

Type Mapping will allow you to search for documents from the selected scope, selected collections from the scope, and for a specific document type from the selected scope and collections.

** Left click on the +Add Type Mapping button. The display now appears as follows:

In the Type Mappings, you can add mapping of a *single collection* or *multiple collections*. To specify the collection, click the Collection drop-down list and select the required collection.

The *Collection* field displays the selected collection along with the selected scope. For example, inventory.airport or inventory.hotel.

** Click ok to add the collection to the index. Continue the same process to add other collections to the index.

NOTE: In Type Mappings, you can add multiple collections to the index. However, you can either select only one collection to create a single collection index or select multiple collections to create an index with multiple collections. The Type Mappings panel appears as follows:
