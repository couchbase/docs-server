= Conjunction & Disjunction Query

== Conjunction Query (AND)

A _conjunction_ query contains multiple _child queries_.
Its result documents must satisfy all of the child queries.

{
 "conjuncts":[
   {"field":"reviews.content", "match": "location"},
   {"field":"free_breakfast", "bool": true}
 ]
}

A demonstration of a conjunction query using the Java SDK can be found in xref:3.2@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].

== Disjunction Query (OR)

A _disjunction_ query contains multiple _child queries_.
Its result documents must satisfy a configurable `min` number of child queries.
By default this `min` is set to 1.
For example, if three child queries — A, B, and C — are specified, a `min` of 1 specifies that the result documents should be those returned uniquely for A (with all returned uniquely for B and C, and all returned commonly for A, B, and C, omitted).
