= Classic Editor

[abstract]

The classic editor is the most advanced tool where users can directly configure the index mapping with all capabilities. 

This section introduces index creations via a step by step walk through using the classic editor.  The reader should be already familiar with the basic concepts of full-text search 

This example xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc#main[Creating a Dynamic Index] covers creating an index that dynamically indexes every field in a collection.

You can build the exact same index via the command line use the REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index via the REST API].

= Creating a Dynamic Index

This section describes creating and Index on a bucket's collection across *all fields in the a collection*.  

This is equivalent to the xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc#main[Creating a Legacy Index].  
 
To create the desired index through the Classic Editor:

* Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click the *Add Index* link in the upper right of the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.
+

* To define any index on which Full Text Search a unique name for the index in the *Index Name* field, on the upper-left. Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names and the first character of the name must be alphabetic. 
+
Enter *test_dynamic* as the name of the Search index you are creating in the *Index Name* text-box.
+

* Select the bucket *travel-sample* from the *Bucket* pull-down menu.
+
Use the pull-down menu provided for the Bucket field, on the upper-right, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+
image::fts-index-name-and-bucket-dynamic.png[,450,align=left]

* Select the checkbox *[X] Use non-default scope/collections* 
+
This allows your index to stream mutations from one or more non-default collections under the selected bucket and scope.
+
image::fts-select-dynamic-scope-collections.png[,450,align=left]

* You will see a newly visible pull-down menu provided for the *Scope* field, under the *[X] Use non-default scope/collections* checkbox, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+
For this example leave the setting as *_default* which which is used to migrate bucket based data into the collections paradigm. 

* Under *Type Mapings*, unselect the checkbox *[ ]  default | dynamic*.
+
This is required as this type mapping (the default mapping) is only valid for the <bucket>._default._default which is typically used to upgrade a 6.X server from a bucket into a more powerful collections paradigm.  In this example we will do the equivlent but on a per collections basis.

* Click on the button *+ Add Type Mapping*

** A new section with a *Collection* pull-down, *Analyzer* pull-down and a *[ ] only index specified fields* checkbox will appear.
+

** Select *_default* from the *Collection* pull-down, note the pull down will change to a text field prefilled with *_default._default*
+
image::fts-index-menu1-geopoint-filled.png[,600,align=left]

** Leave the *[{nbsp}{nbsp}] only index specified fields* checkbox blank or unset.
+
This will index all fields in the scope *_default* collection *_default*, howver not this is not recommended for large production datasets.

** Click on the blue *ok* at the right of the section to save this mapping.

* Save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen.
+
This is all you need to specify in order to create a more advanced index for test and development. No further configuration is required.
+

* If you subsequently Edit your Index it should look like the following:
+

NOTE: Indexing all fields as above indexes across all fields is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.

== Test the Dynamic Index with a simple query

In the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click on the index you just created (named "landmark-content-index") to expand the Index's controls.

* In the text area of the search box enter *+view +food +beach* this will search on all three keywords

* Click on the blue *Search* button. You will get documents from only collection landmark and due to the options you selected you will see highlighted words in your results.
