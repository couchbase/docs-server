== Partial and Full Results
The search service reserves the capability of delivering partial results when some of the nodes in the Couchbase system are unreachable. The search request provides an option for a user who wishes to obtain either the complete result set or none at all.

Every search returns the number of partition indexes that succeeded, along with the search hits from those indexes. This information is merged and sorted into a single result-set, either partial or full, providing a fault tolerance mechanism.

=== Full Results

If the query successfully executes for the given attributes, the developer can use the full result option to display the complete result of the query, including all response objects.

==== Example

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "status":{"total":1,"failed":0,"successful":1},
  "request":{
    "query":{"query":"+name:air* +country:france"},"size":10,"from":0,"highlight":null,"fields":null,"facets":null,"explain":false,"sort":["-_score"],"includeLocations":false,"search_after":null,"search_before":null
  },
  "hits":[
    {"index":"DemoIndex_580e3ee6ba3ac900_4c1c5584","id":"hotel_19199","score":3.166810600229102,"sort":["_score"],"fields":{"_$c":"hotel"}}
  ],
  "total_hits":1,"max_score":3.166810600229102,"took":593704,"facets":null
}
----

=== Partial Results

Suppose some of the partition indexes fail to respond before the timeout, or respond with an error. In that case, the developers can use the partial result option to display the result for partial execution of the query.

==== Example

[source,JSON]
----
"error":"rest_index: Query, indexName: DemoIndex, err: context deadline exceeded","request":{"ctl":{"timeout":2},"from":10,"query":{"field":"country","wildcard":"f*ce"},"size":10},"status":"fail"}
