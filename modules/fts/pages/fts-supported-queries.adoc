== Query-Specification Options

Full Text Search allows a range of query options. These include:

* Input-text and target-text can be _analyzed_: this transforms input-text into _token-streams_, according to different specified criteria, so allowing richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching.
* The _fuzziness_ of a query can be specified so that the scope of matches can be constrained to a particular level of exactitude.
A high degree of fuzziness means that a large number of partial matches may be returned.
* Multiple queries can be specified for simultaneous processing, with one given a higher _boost_ than another, so ensuring that its results are returned at the top of the set.
* _Regular expressions_ and _wildcards_ can be used in text-specification for search-input.
* _Compound_ queries can be designed, such that appropriate conjunction or disjunction of the total result-set can be returned.

#All the above options, and others, are explained in detail on the page xref:fts-query-types.adoc[Query Types].#
