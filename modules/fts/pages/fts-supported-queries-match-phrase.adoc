= Match Phrase Query

The input text is analyzed, and a phrase query is built with the terms resulting from the analysis.
This type of query searches for terms in the target that occur _in the positions and offsets indicated by the input_: this depends on _term vectors_, which must have been included in the creation of the index used for the search.

For example, a match phrase query for `location for functions` is matched with `locate the function`, if the standard analyzer is used: this analyzer uses a _stemmer_, which tokenizes `location` and `locate` to `locat`, and reduces `functions` and `function` to `function`.
Additionally, the analyzer employs _stop_ removal, which removes small and less significant words from input and target text, so that matches are attempted on only the more significant elements of vocabulary: in this case  `for` and `the` are removed.
Following this processing, the tokens `locat` and `function` are recognized as _common to both input and target_; and also as being both _in the same sequence as_, and _at the same distance from_ one another; and therefore a match is made.

== Example

The following JSON object demonstrates specification of a match phrase query:


[source,json]
----
{
 "match_phrase": "very nice",
 "field": "reviews.content"
}

A match phrase query is also demonstrated by means of the Java SDK, in xref:2.7@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].
