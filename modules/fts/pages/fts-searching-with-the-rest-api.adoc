= Searching with the REST API

[abstract]
Full Text Search can be performed by means of the Couchbase REST API.

[#performing-a-full-text-search-with-rest-at-the-command-line]
== Performing a Full Text Search with REST at the Command-Line

Full Text Search can be performed with the Couchbase REST API; at the command-line, by means of the `curl` utility.

The syntactic elements for a `curl`-based Full Text Search can be obtained from the Couchbase Web Console: the console allows searches performed via the UI to be translated dynamically into `curl` examples.
To demonstrate this, follow the procedures for accessing the Full Text Search screen, within the Couchbase Web Console, and for performing a simple search; as described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI].
Then, left-click on the *show advanced query settings* checkbox, at the right-hand side of the *Search* button:

[#fts_advanced_query_settings]
image::fts-advanced-query-settings.png[,680,align=left]

The *JSON for Query Request* panel displays the submitted query in JSON format.
Note the *show command-line curl example* checkbox, which when checked, adds to the content of the initial JSON display, to form a completed curl command:

[#fts_ui_curl_exammple]
image::fts-ui-curl-example.png[,520,align=left]

This example can be copied by means of the *Copy to Clipboard* button, pasted into (for example) a standard console-window, and executed against the prompt.
This feature therefore provides a useful means of extending experiments initially performed with the UI into a subsequent console-based, script-based, or program-based context.
Note, however, that authentication is required for the call to be successful from any context outside the current Couchbase Web Console session.
Additionally, familiarity with _query strings_ should be acquired, for the creation of more complex queries.

[#using-query-strings]
== Query Strings and Authentication

A _Query String_ combines standard alphanumeric characters with syntactic elements, in order to specify complex queries in ASCII form.
Query Strings can be used for Full Text Searches performed with both the Couchbase Web Console and the REST API.
A detailed description of Query String-format is provided in xref:fts-query-types.adoc[Query  Types].

For example, to search for instances of both `nice` and `view`, specify `"+nice +view"` in a search from the Couchbase Web Console:

[#fts_query_string_query_at_ui]
image::fts-query-string-query-at-ui.png[,520,align=left]

When the search has returned, check in succession the *show advanced query settings* and *show command-line curl example* checkboxes.
The *JSON for Query Request* now displays the following:

[#fts_query_string_results_at_ui]
image::fts-query-string-results-at-ui.png[,520,align=left]

Copy the `curl` command displayed, by left-clicking on the *Copy to Clipboard* button.
Before attempting to execute the command from the command-line, paste it into a text-editor, and add appropriate authentication-credentials.
For example:

[source,bourne]
----
curl -u Administrator:password -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:8094/api/index/travel-sample-index/query \
-d '{
  "explain": true,
  "fields": [
    "*"
  ],
  "highlight": {},
  "query": {
    "query": "{ \"+nice +view\" }"
  }
}'
----

(For detailed information on Couchbase Server _Role-Based Access Control_, see xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].)

The code can now be again copied, pasted against the command-line, and executed; with the result-set appearing as standard output.

For additional assistance on Query String composition, left-click on the *full text query syntax help* link that appears under the *Search* interactive text-field when *show advanced query settings* is checked:

[#fts_query_syntax_help_linke]

This link provides access to https://developer.couchbase.com/fts/5.0/query-string-query[page^] of information on _Query String_ Full Text Search queries.

[#fts-secure-search]
== Searching Securely

To search securely, specify port `18094`.
For example:

[source,bourne]
----
curl -u Administrator:password -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:18094/api/index/travel-sample-index/query \
-d '{
  "explain": true,
  "fields": [
    "*"
  ],
  "highlight": {},
  "query": {
    "query": "{ \"+nice +view\" }"
  }
}'
