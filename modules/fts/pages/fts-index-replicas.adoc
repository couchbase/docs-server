:description: If an active index is lost, a replica is promoted to active status, and use of the index is uninterrupted.
= Index Replicas
Index Replicas support availability: if an Index Service-node is lost from the cluster, its indexes may exist as replicas on another cluster-node that runs the Index Service.

{description}

The *Index Replicas* interface allows up to three index replicas to be selected, from a pull-down menu:

Each replica must exist on a node separate from its active index, and from any other replica of that active index.
Attempts to add more than the number of replicas permitted by the current cluster-configuration is not permitted and results in an error message:
