= Child Field DocValues
:page-aliases: creating-indexes.adoc

When checked, the _value_ for each instance of the field is itself included in the index.
This provides essential support for xref:fts:fts-response-object-schema.adoc#search-facets[Search Facets], and for the sorting of search results based on field values: see xref:fts:fts-sorting.adoc[Sorting Query Results].

NOTE: Whenever this checkbox is checked, the resulting index will be correspondingly larger.

By default, this checkbox is selected. If it is _unchecked_, the values are _not_ added to the index; and in consequence, neither Search Facets nor value-based result-sorting is supported.

Note that when the value of the specified field is an array, the array-values are all indexed and searched individually: no special configuration is required.
