= Child Field DocValues

To include the value for each instance of the field in the index, the docvalues checkbox must be checked. This is essential for xref:fts-search-response-facets.adoc[Facets].

For sorting of search results based on field values: see xref:fts-sorting.adoc[Sorting Query Results].

By default, this checkbox is selected. If it is _unchecked_, the values are _not_ added to the index; and in consequence, neither Search Facets nor value-based result-sorting is supported.

NOTE: When this checkbox is checked, the resulting index will increase proportionately in size.
When the value of the specified field is an array, the array-values are all indexed and searched individually: no special configuration is required.
