= Consistency Results

Consistency result is the attribute that you can use to set the query result option, such as complete.

Example:

{
  "query": {...}, 
  "ctl": {
    "consistency": {
      "results": "complete"
    }
  }
} 

== The "Complete" option

The complete option allows you to set the query result as "complete" which indicates that if any of the index partitions are unavailable due to the node not being reachable, the query will display an error in response instead of partial results.
    
Example:

{
  "query": {...}, 
  "ctl": {
    "consistency": {
      "results": "complete"
    }
  }
}
