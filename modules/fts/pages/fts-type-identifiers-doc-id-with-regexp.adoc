== Doc ID with regex
A regular expression that is applied by the index to the ID of each document. The resulting value is determined to be the type of  document. (This option may be used when the targeted document-subset contains neither a suitable *JSON type field* nor an ID that follows a naming convention suitable for *Doc ID up to separator*.) The value entered into the field should be the regular expression to be used.
