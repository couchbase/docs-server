== Partial Errors

It is possible that when some of the index partitions have reported failures, the "status" in the response does not show fail. This is when the user will see a partial result set for their query.

Below is the sample response

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": {
    "total": 6,
    "failed": 2,
    "successful": 4,
    "errors": {
        "pindex_name_1": "xyz",
        "pindex_name_2": "xyz"
    }
  },
  "request": {
    "query": {
      ...
    },
    "size": 10,
    "from": 0,
    "facets": {},
    "sort": [
      "-_score"
    ]
  },
  "hits": [...],
  "total_hits": ...,
  "max_score": ...,
  "took": ...,
  "facets": {}
}
----

If one or more of the index partitions failed to cater to the request, the user can see partial results. In such a case, the response status is shown as 200 , and the errors object in the response will be a non-zero length value.
