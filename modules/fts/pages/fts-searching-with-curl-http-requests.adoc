[abstract]
Full Text Search can be performed using the Couchbase REST API (cURL/HTTP), at the command-line, through the `curl` utility.

[#performing-a-full-text-search-with-rest-at-the-command-line]
== Performing a Full Text Search with REST at the Command-Line

The syntactic elements for a `curl`-based Full Text Search can be obtained from the Couchbase Web Console. The console allows searches performed via the UI to be translated dynamically into `curl` examples.

To demonstrate this, follow the procedures for accessing the Full Text Search screen, within the Couchbase Web Console, and for performing a simple search; as described in xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI]. Then, left-click on the *show advanced query settings* checkbox, at the right-hand side of the *Search* button:

[#fts_advanced_query_settings]
image::fts-advanced-query-settings.png[,680,align=left]

The *JSON for Query Request* panel displays the submitted query in JSON format.
Note the *show command-line curl example* checkbox. Selecting this checkbox adds to the content of the initial JSON display to form a completed curl command:

[#fts_ui_curl_exammple]
image::fts-ui-curl-example.png[,520,align=left]

This example can be copied by means of the *Copy to Clipboard* button, pasted into (for example) a standard console-window, and executed against the prompt.
This feature , therefore, provides a useful means of extending experiments initially performed with the UI into a subsequent console-based, script-based, or program-based context.
Note, however, that authentication is required for the call to be successful from any context outside the current Couchbase Web Console session.
Additionally, familiarity with _query strings_ should be acquired for the creation of more complex queries.

[#using-query-strings]
== Query Strings and Authentication

A _Query String_ combines standard alphanumeric characters with syntactic elements in order to specify complex queries in ASCII form.
Query Strings can be used for Full Text Searches performed with both the Couchbase Web Console and the REST API.
A detailed description of Query String-format is provided in xref:fts-supported-queries.adoc[Supported Queries].

For example, to search for instances of both `nice` and `view`, specify `"+nice +view"` in a search from the Couchbase Web Console:

[#fts_query_string_query_at_ui]
image::fts-query-string-query-at-ui.png[,520,align=left]

When the search has returned, check in succession the *show advanced query settings* and *show command-line curl example* checkboxes.
The *JSON for Query Request* now displays the following:

[#fts_query_string_results_at_ui]
image::fts-query-string-results-at-ui.png[,520,align=left]

Copy the `curl` command displayed by left-clicking on the *Copy to Clipboard* button.
Before attempting to execute the command from the command-line, paste it into a text-editor, and add appropriate authentication-credentials.
For example:

[source,bourne]
----
curl -u username:password -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:8094/api/index/travel-sample-index/query \
-d '{
  "explain": true,
  "fields": [
    "*"
  ],
  "highlight": {},
  "query": {
    "query": "{ \"+nice +view\" }"
  }
}'
----

(For detailed information on Couchbase Server _Role-Based Access Control_, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].)

The code can now be copied again and pasted against the command-line, and executed, with the result-set appearing as standard output.

For additional assistance on Query String composition, left-click on the *full text query syntax help* link that appears under the *Search* interactive text-field when *show advanced query settings* is checked:

[#fts_query_syntax_help_linke]

This link provides access to a xref:query-string-queries.adoc[page] of information on _Query String_ Full Text Search queries.

[#searching-specifically]
== Searching Specifically

Searches should always be as specific as possible: this helps to avoid excessive resource-consumption, and the retrieval of unnecessarily large amounts of data.
To facilitate this, the number of _clauses_ that can be returned by a Search Service query is deliberately capped at _1024_: if a larger number of clauses is to be returned by a query, an error is thrown.

For example, the following query attempts to use the wildcard `*`, to return all data from documents' `reviews.content` field.
The output is piped to the http://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq] program, to enhance readability:

[source, console]
----
curl -u username:password -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
http://localhost:8094/api/index/travel-sample-index/query \
-d '{
  "explain": true,
  "fields": [
    "*"
  ],
  "highlight": {},
  "query": {
    "wildcard": "*",
    "field": "reviews.content"
  }
}' | jq '.'
----

Due to the excessive number of clauses that this query would return, an error is thrown.
The initial part of the error-output is as follows:

[source, json]
----
{
  "status": {
    "total": 6,
    "failed": 6,
    "successful": 0,
    "errors": {
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_13aa53f3": "TooManyClauses[8550 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]",
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_18572d87": "TooManyClauses[8731 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]",
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_54820232": "TooManyClauses[8130 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]",
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_6ddbfb54": "TooManyClauses[8694 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]",
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_aa574717": "TooManyClauses[8731 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]",
      "travel-sample-index_666185f510578977_f4e0a48a": "TooManyClauses[8450 > maxClauseCount, which is set to 1024]"
    }
      .
      .
      .
----

Therefore, to fix the problem, the wildcard match should be more precisely specified, and the query re-attempted.
