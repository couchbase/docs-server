= Escaping

The following quoted-string enumerates the characters which may be escaped:

----
"+-=&|><!(){}[]^\"~*?:\\/ "
----

NOTE: This list contains the space character.

In order to escape these characters, they are prefixed with the `\` (backslash) character.
In all cases, using the escaped version produces the character itself and is not interpreted by the lexer.

For example:

* `my\ name` is interpreted as a single argument to a match query with the value "my name".
* `"contains a\" character"` is interpreted as a single argument to a phrase query with the value `contains a " character`.
