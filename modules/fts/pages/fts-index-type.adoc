= Index Type
:page-aliases: creating-indexes.adoc

The *Index Type* interface provides a drop-down menu from which the appropriate index type can be selected:

[#index_type_interface_image]
image::fts-index-type-interface.png[,%100]

Following options are available: 

** Version 6.0 (Scorch) reduces the size of the index-footprint on disk and provides enhanced performance for indexing and mutation-handling

** Version 5.0 (Moss) is the standard form of index to be used in test, development, and production. This version is deprecated.

NOTE: The type of an index is saved in its JSON definition, which can be previewed in the _Index Definition Preview panel_, at the right-hand side.

== Example
