== Index Type
The *Index Type* interface provides a pull-down menu, from which the appropriate index type can be selected:

[#index_type_interface_image]
image::fts-index-type-interface.png[,%100]

Two options are available: Version 5.0 (Moss) is the standard form of index, to be used in test, development, and production; Version 6.0 (Scorch) reduces the size of the index-footprint on disk, and provides enhanced performance for indexing and mutation-handling.

NOTE: The type of an index is saved in its JSON definition, which can be previewed in the _Index Definition Preview panel_, at the right-hand side.

Version 5.0 contained the following value for the store attribute:

[source,Javascript]
----

"store": {
  "kvStoreName": "mossStore"
},
----
Version 6.0 and after contains a different value:

[source,javascript]
----

"store": {
  "kvStoreName": "",
  "indexType": "scorch"
},
