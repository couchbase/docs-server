= Term Range Query

A _term range_ query finds documents containing a term in the specified field within the specified range.

Define the endpoints using the fields [.param]`min` and [.param]`max`.
You can omit one endpoint, but not both.
The [.param]`inclusive_min` and [.param]`inclusive_max` properties control whether or not the endpoints are included or excluded.

By default, [.param]`min` is inclusive and [.param]`max` is exclusive.

== Example

[source,json]
----
{
 "min": "foo", "max": "foof",
 "inclusive_min": false,
 "inclusive_max": false,
 "field": "desc"
}
