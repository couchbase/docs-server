= ftsMemoryQuota

The `ftsMemoryQuota` setting controls the maximum usable memory for the FTS Search service from the total amount of RAM available in the system. 

The FTS Search service does not mandate any minimum memory-resident ratio for its index. However, users can spare enough memory quota for a healthy resident ratio of the index. This lets the system have sufficient memory available to perform the indexing, querying, or other lifecycle operations like rebalances, etc.

Using the manager option, users can control the FTS/Search service's memory quota at run time without a service reboot.
