= Tips for Sorting with fields
:description: When you sort results on a field that is not indexed, or when a particular document is missing a value for that field, you will see the following series of Unicode non-printable characters appear in the sort field:

{description}

`\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd` 

The same characters may render differently when using a graphic tool or command line tools like `jq`.

      "sort": [
        "����������",
        "hotel_9723",
        "_score"
      ]

Check your index definition to confirm that you are indexing all the fields you intend to sort by. You can control the sort behavior for missing attributes using the missing field.
