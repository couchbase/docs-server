= Fuzzy Query

A _fuzzy query_ matches terms within a specified _edit_ (or _Levenshtein_) distance: meaning that terms are considered to match when they are to a specified degree _similar_, rather than _exact_.
A common prefix of a stated length may be also specified as a requirement for matching.

NOTE: The fuzzy query is a non-analytic query, meaning it won't perform any text analysis on the query text.

Fuzziness is specified by means of a single integer.
For example:

[source,json]
----
{
 "term": "interest",
 "field": "reviews.content",
 "fuzziness": 2
}
----

A demonstration of __Fuzziness__ by means of the Java SDK, in the context of the _term query_ (see below), can be found in xref:3.2@java-sdk::full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK].

NOTE: Two such queries are specified, with the difference in fuzziness between them resulting in different forms of match, and different sizes of result-sets.
