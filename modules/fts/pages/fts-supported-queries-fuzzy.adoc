= Fuzzy Query

A fuzzy query matches terms within a specified edit (or Levenshtein) distance: meaning that terms are considered to match when they are to a specified degree similar, rather than exact. A common prefix of a stated length may be also specified as a requirement for matching.

Fuzziness is specified by means of a single integer. For example:

----
{
  "query": {
	"field": "name",
	"match": "enfosis",
	"fuzziness": 2
  }
}
