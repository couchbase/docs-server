= Date Range Query

A _date_range_ query finds documents containing a date value, in the specified field within the specified range. 

Dates should be in the format specified by RFC-3339, which is a specific profile of ISO-8601. 

Define the endpoints using the fields [.param]`start` and [.param]`end`. 
You can omit any one endpoint, but not both.

The [.param]`inclusive_start` and [.param]`inclusive_end` properties in the query JSON control whether or not the endpoints are included or excluded.

== Example

[source,json]
----
{
 "start": "2001-10-09T10:20:30-08:00",
 "end": "2016-10-31",
 "inclusive_start": false,
 "inclusive_end": false,
 "field": "review_date"
}
----

The default datetime parser is *dateTimeOptional* which contaings the following layouts s per the syntax in https://pkg.go.dev/time :

[cols="<,<", options="header"]
|===
|Format |Name

|2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00 |time.RFC3339Nano
|2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00 |time.RFC3339
|2006-01-02T15:04:05 |rfc3339NoTimezone
|2006-01-02 15:04:05 |rfc3339NoTimezoneNoT
|2006-01-02 |rfc3339NoTime
|===

Other formats such as *reviews.date* in *travel-sample.inventory.hotel* keyspace will need a "Custom Date/Time Parser" as default *dateTimeOptional* will not match the data values or strings like "date": "2013-06-22 18:33:50 +0300"

If you create a "Custom Date/Time Parser" all layout template should be defined as per the syntax in https://pkg.go.dev/time :

[cols="<,<", options="header"]
|===
|Type |Options

|Year |06, 2006
|Month |01, 1, Jan, January
|Day |02, 2, _2
|Weekday |Mon, Monday
|Hours |03, 3, 15
|Minutes |04, 4
|Seconds |05, 5
|ms μs ns |.000, .000000, .000000000
|ms μs ns |.999, .999999, .999999999 (trailing zeros removed)
|am/pm |PM, pm
|Timezone |MST
|Offset |-0700, -07, -07:00, Z0700, Z07:00
|===

The layout template needed for a "Custom Date/Time Parser" that will recognize  travel-sample fields with strings like "2013-06-22 18:33:50 +0300" is "2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700" as per the table above.

NOTE: It is important that you follow the syntax in the above table derived from https://pkg.go.dev/time you cannot just past in a random date.  For example only 06 or 2006 in the layout template will be a year.
