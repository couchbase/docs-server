== Scoring

Search result scoring occurs at a query time. The result of the search request is ordered by *score* (relevance), with the descending sort order unless explicitly set not to do so.

For more details on tf-idf, refer xref:fts-scoring-tf-idf-how-it-works.adoc[tf-idf]

Couchbase uses a slightly modified version of the standard *tf-idf*  algorithm. This deviation is to normalize the score and is based on *tf-idf* algorithm.

By selecting the `explain score` option within the search request, you can obtain the explanation of how the score was calculated for a result alongside it.

Search query scores all the qualified documents for relevance and applies relevant filters. 

In a search request, you can set `score` to `none` to disable scoring by. See xref:fts-scoring-score-none.adoc[Score:none]

== Example

The following sample query response shows the *score* field for each document retrieved for the query request:
