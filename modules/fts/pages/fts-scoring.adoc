== Scoring

Search result scoring occurs at query time. The results for a search request are ordered by *score* (relevance) , with the sort order being descending unless explicitly set not to do so.

#need explanation or link here for tf-idf#

Couchbase uses a slightly modified version of the standard *tf-idf*  algorithm. This deviation is to normalize the score and is based on *tf-idf* algorithm.

#need example for explain score#

By specfying the `explain score` option within the search request, you can obtain the explanation of how the score was calculated for a result alongside it.

Seacrh query scores all the qualified documents for relevance and applies relevant filters. 

In a search request, you can set `score` to `none` to disable scoring by. See xref:fts-scoring-score-none.adoc[Score:none]
