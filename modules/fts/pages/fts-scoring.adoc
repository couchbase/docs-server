== Scoring

Search result scoring occurs at query time. The results for a search request are ordered by *score* (relevance) with the sort order being descending, unless explicitly set not to do so.

Couchbase (via bleve) uses a slightly modified version of the standard *tf-idf* algorithm. This deviation is to normalize the score by various relevant factors.

By selecting the `explain score` option within the search request, you can obtain the explanation of how the score was calculated for a result alongside it.

Scores for result document hits are calculated by default, whether the score is used for ordering or not. This means calculation of various frequency and normalization information for the search terms at query time.

In a search request, you can set `score` to `none` to disable scoring by. See xref:fts-scoring-score-none.adoc[Score:none]
