= Clone Index

You can access the Full Text Indexes from the *Search* tab. Left-click on this to display the *Full Text Search* panel, which contains a tabular presentation of currently existing indexes, with a row for each index.
(See xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI] for a full illustration.)

To clone an index, left-click on its row. The row expands, as follows:

[#fts_index_management_ui]

[.ui]*Clone* button click brings up the *Clone Index* screen, which allows a copy of the current index to be modified as appropriate and required, and saved under a new name.
