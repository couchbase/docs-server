= Index Partitions

The *Index Partitions* interface provides a section to enter the number of partitions to split the index into:

[#fts_index_partitions_interface]

This number represents the number of active partitions for an index, and the active partitions are distributed across all the nodes in the cluster where the search service is running.

The default option for the `Index Partition` setting is 6. 

NOTE: The type of index is saved in its JSON definition, which you can view in the _Index Definition Preview_ panel, at the right-hand side.
See xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#using-the-index-definition-preview[Using the Index Definition Preview].
