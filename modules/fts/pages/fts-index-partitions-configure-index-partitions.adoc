The default option for this setting is 1. Note that this number represents the number of active partitions for an index, and the active partitions are distributed across all the nodes in the cluster where the search service is running.

Note that the type of index is saved in its JSON definition, which can be previewed in the _Index Definition Preview_ panel, at the right-hand side.
See xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#using-the-index-definition-preview[Using the Index Definition Preview].
