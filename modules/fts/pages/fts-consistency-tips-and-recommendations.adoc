= Consistency Tips and Recommendations

Consistency vectors provide 'read your own writes' functionality where the read operation waits for a specific time until the write operation is finished.

When users know that their queries are complex which require more time in completing the write operations, they can set the timeout value higher than the default timeout of 10 seconds so that consistency can be obtained in the search operations. 

However, if this consistency is not required, the users can optimize their search operations by using the default timeout of 10 seconds.

Example
{

  "ctl": {
    "timeout": 10000,
    "consistency": {
      "vectors": {
        "index1": {
          "607/205096593892159": 2,
          "640/298739127912798": 4
        }
      },
      "level": "at_plus"
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "match": "airport",
    "field": "type"
  }

}
