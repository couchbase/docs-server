The following, interactive fields are displayed:

== Default Analyzer

This is the default analyzer to be used.
The default value is `standard`.

The default analyzer is applicable to all the text fields across type mappings unless explicitly overridden.

It is the _standard_ analyzer in which analysis is done by the means of the Unicode tokenizer, the to_lower token filter, and the stop token filter.

== Default Date/Time Parser

This is the default date/time parser to be used.

The default datetime parser is applicable to all the datetime fields across the type mappings unless explicitly overridden.

The default value is `dateTimeOptional`.

== Default Field

Indexed fields need to have this option selected to support the- "include in _all", where all is the composite field.

The default value is `__all_`.

== Store Dynamic Fields

When checked, it ensures inclusion of field-content in returned results.

When unchecked, no such inclusion occurs.
