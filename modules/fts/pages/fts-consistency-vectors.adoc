== Example

----
{
  "ctl": {
    "timeout": 10000,
    "consistency": {
      "vectors": {
        "index1": {
          "607/205096593892159": 2,
          "640/298739127912798": 4
        }
      },
      "level": "at_plus"
    }
  },
  "query": {
    "match": "jack",
    "field": "name"
  }
}
----

In the above example, this is the consistency vectors.

----
"index1": {
  "607/205096593892159": 2,
  "640/298739127912798": 4
}
----

The query is looking within the FTS index "index1" - for ..

* vbucket 607 (with UUID 205096593892159) to contain sequence number 2
* vbucket 640 (with UUID 298739127912798) to contain sequence number 4
