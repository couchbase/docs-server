= Type Mapping with Specific Document Type
:description: With a specific document type, you can search documents of a specific type from a single collection or multiple collections.

{description} Every document in Couchbase includes the type field that represents the type of the document. For example, the type “airport” represents the documents related to airport information.

If you want to search for a specific document type from a single collection or multiple collections, you can manually specify the document type after the collection in the Collection field. For example, inventory.airline.airport or inventory.route.airport.

** xref:fts-type-mapping-specific-document-type-single-collection.adoc[Document Type with single collection]

** xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#using-the-index-definition-previewfts-type-mapping-specific-document-type-multiple-collections.adoc[Document Type with multiple collections]

Now, when you search for the airport document type, the index will display all documents from a single collection or multiple collections where the type field is the airport.
