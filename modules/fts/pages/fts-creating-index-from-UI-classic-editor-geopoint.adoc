= Classic Editor

[abstract]

The classic editor is the most advanced tool where users can directly configure the index mapping with all capabilities. 

You can build the exact same index via the command line use the REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-geopoint.adoc[Creating a Geopoint Index via the REST API].  

This section introduces index creations via a step by step walk through using the classic editor.  The reader should be already familiar with the basic concepts of full-text search 

This example xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc#main[Creating a Geopoint Index] covers simple geospatial Search indexes of type geopoint.
However it should be noted that it only scratches the surface and does not cover all geospatial features.  


[#main]

= Creating a Geopoint Index

This section describes creating and Index on a bucket's collection across *all fields in the a collection*.  In addition a specific field is overridden as a geospatial type of geopoint.

This is equivalent to the xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc#main[Creating a Legacy Index] example with two exceptions:
 
 * The index is defined using the newer collections paradigm (instead of the "legacy" default mapping).
 
 * The field *geo* is overridden from the dynamic indexing to support geospatial queries as a type *geopoint*.

To create the desired index through the Classic Editor:

* Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

== Test the Geopoint Index with a simple query

In the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click on the index you just created (named "test_geopoint") to expand the Index's controls.

* In the text area of the search box enter the following text (this is a radius query):

The above query-body specifies a longitude of `-2.235143` and a latitude of `53.482358`.
The target-field `geo` is specified, as is a `distance` of `100` miles: this is the radius within which target-locations must reside for their documents to be returned.  Don't worry about newlines when you paste the text.

* Click on the blue *Search* button. You will get documents from only collection landmark and due to the options you selected you will see highlighted words in your results.
