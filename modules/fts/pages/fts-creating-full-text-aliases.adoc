= Creating Index Alias

[abstract]
Full Text Index Alias is the name that can be used in place of the actual full text index name. You can also perform the searches across multiple buckets and multiple scopes by using index aliases.
 
An index alias points to one or more Full Text Indexes index aliases: its purpose is comparable to a symbolic link in a computer filesystem. Queries on an index alias are performed on all underlying indexes, and all the results from each scan is returned to the application.

The use of index aliases permits applications refer to a placeholder (the alias-name) that never changes, leaving administrators free periodically to change the identity of the real index pointed to by the alias. This may be particularly useful when an index needs to be updated: to avoid down-time, while the current index remains in service, a clone of the current index can be created, modified, and tested. Then, when the clone is ready, the existing alias can be retargeted so that the clone becomes the current index; and the (now) previous index can be removed.

The following process explains how to create an index alias in Couchbase:

Access the couchbase application. In the left pane, click *Search*. The Full Text Aliases panel is shown at the bottom of the page.

Now, click *+ Add Alias* to add  new alias. The Add Alias page opens.

In the Add Alias page, add the alias name in the *Index Name* field. After that select one or more indexes from the *Target Indexes* list for which you want to add an alias. The selected index is highlighted in a separate color.

Finally, click *Create Index Alias*. The new index alias is added to the list in the Full Text Aliases panel.

=== **R**ole **B**ased **A**ccess **C**ontrol rules for Index-Alias

For accessing an index-alias, the user needs to have the reader permissions for all the comprising index definitions in the alias.

=== Index Lifecycle Implications

If any of the index definition comprised within the index-alias gets deleted, then the index-alias would become invalid immediately. It would throw respective error messages upon any further access.
