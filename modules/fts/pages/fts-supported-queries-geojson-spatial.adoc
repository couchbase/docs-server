= Geospatial GeoJSON Queries

[abstract]
_GeoJSON_ queries return documents that contain location in either legacy Geopoint format or standard GeoJson, thus providing more utility than that of legacy  point-distance, bounded-rectangle and bounded-polygon against the indexed Geopoint fields.

== Prerequisites - Modify the travel-sample dataset

The `travel-sample` bucket, provided for test and development, DOES NOT contains any GeoJSON constructs in the documentes (only legacy Geopoint information) as such you will need to modify the `travel-sample` data to work with GeoJSON.

A dataset modification can be eaisly accomplished via either "Converting Geopoints" to GeoJSON Point types or "Adding a new GeoJSON object(s)".  To run the examples in this doucmentation the later update method *"Adding a new GeoJSON object(s)"* is needed.

* Example documents that have a geo field (airports, hotels or landmarks) such as `airport_1254` in `travel-sample._default._default`:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
  "city": "Calais",
  "country": "France",
  "faa": "CQF",
  "geo": {
    "alt": 12,
    "lat": 50.962097,
    "lon": 1.954764
  },
  "icao": "LFAC",
  "id": 1254,
  "type": "airport",
  "tz": "Europe/Paris"
}
----

* Converting Geopoints *_(for reference only)_*
+
Using SQL++ (or N1QL) in the Query Workbench we can quickly convert all top level "geo" objects in `travel-sample._default._default`
+
[source, n1ql]
----
UPDATE `travel-sample`._default._default 
    SET geo.type = "Point", geo.coordinates = [geo.lon, geo.lat] WHERE geo IS NOT null;

UPDATE `travel-sample`._default._default 
    UNSET geo.lat, geo.lon WHERE geo IS NOT null;
----
+
After running the above conversion we would get updated documents like:
+
[source, json]
----
{
  "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
  "city": "Calais",
  "country": "France",
  "faa": "CQF",
  "geo": {
    "alt": 12,
    "coordinates": [
      1.954764,
      50.962097
    ],
    "type": "Point"
  },
  "icao": "LFAC",
  "id": 1254,
  "type": "airport",
  "tz": "Europe/Paris"
}
----

* Adding a new GeoJSON object(s) *_(required for running any examples)_*
+
Using SQL++ (or N1QL) in the Query Workbench we can quickly read the "geo" objects in `travel-sample._default._default` and generate and add a new geojson object to each document.   In addition the second statement will add a higher level GeoJSON (Couchbase addition to the spec) object representing a 10 mile readius around each airport (only for type=airport).
+
[source, n1ql]
----
UPDATE `travel-sample`._default._default 
    SET geojson = { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [geo.lon, geo.lat] } 
    WHERE geo IS NOT null;
    
UPDATE  `travel-sample`._default._default  
    SET geoarea = { "coordinates": [geo.lon, geo.lat], "type": "circle", "radius": "10mi"}  
    WHERE geo IS NOT null AND type="airport";
----
+
After running the above conversion we would get updated documents for airports like (hotels and landmarks will not have a geoarea sub-object):
+
[source, json]
----

== GeoJSON Syntax

As previously disucussed the supported GeoJSON shapes in the Search service are:

* *Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection*

The search service follows strict GeoJSON syntax for the above seven (7) standard types:

* GeoJSON position arrays are either [longitude, latitude], or [longitude, latitude, altitude].

**  `However the Search service only supports [longitude, latitude].`

* Right-hand rule winding order as per RFC 7946 GeoJSON recommendations

** LineString and Polygon geometries contain coordinates in an order: lines go in a certain direction, and polygon rings do too.

** The direction of LineString often reflects the direction of something in real life: a GPS trace will go in the direction of movement, or a street in the direction of allowed traffic flows.

** Polygon ring order is undefined in GeoJSON, but there’s a useful default to acquire: the right hand rule. Specifically this means that

*** The exterior ring should be counterclockwise.

*** Interior rings should be clockwise.

In addition to the above shapes, Search also supports a two of additional custom shapes (Couchbase specific) to make the spatial approximations easier for users to utilize:

* *Circle, and Envelope*

The search service follows it's own syntax for the above two (2) custom types (see below).

== Supported GeoJSON Data Types

=== Point (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.2[RFC 7946: 3.1.2])

The following specifies a GeoJSON Point field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{ 
 "type": "Point", 
 "coordinates": [75.05687713623047,22.53539059204079]
}
----

A point is a single geographic coordinate, such as the location of a building or the current position given by any Geolocation API.
Note : The standard only supports a single way of specifying the coordinates like an array format of longitude followed by latitude. ie: [lng, lat].

=== Linestring (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.4[RFC 7946: 3.1.4])

The following specifies a GeoJSON Linestring field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{ 
   "type": "LineString", 
   "coordinates": [ 
[ 77.01416015625, 23.0797317624497], 
[ 78.134765625, 20.385825381874263] 
    ] 
}
----

A linestring defined by an array of two or more positions. By specifying only two points, the linestring will represent a straight line. Specifying more than two points creates an arbitrary path.

===  Polygon (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.6[RFC 7946: 3.1.6])

The following specifies a GeoJSON Polygon field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{
 "type": "Polygon",
 "coordinates": [ [ [ 85.605, 57.207], 
                    [ 86.396, 55.998], 
                    [ 87.033, 56.716], 
                    [ 85.605, 57.207] 
                ] ]
}
----

A polygon is defined by a list of a list of points. The first and last points in each (outer) list must be the same (ie, the polygon must be closed). And the exterior coordinates have to be in Counter Clockwise Order in a polygon. (CCW)
Polygons with holes are also supported. The holes has to follow Clockwise Order for the boundary vertices.
For Polygons with a single ring, the ring cannot self-intersect
NOTE: The CCW order of vertices is strictly mandated for the geoshapes in the Couchbase Server release 7.1.2 and any violation of this requirement would result in unexpected search results.

=== MultiPoint (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.3[RFC 7946: 3.1.3])

The following specifies a GeoJSON Multipoint field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{
 "type": "MultiPoint",
 "coordinates": [
    [ -115.8343505859375, 38.45789034424927],
    [ -115.81237792968749, 38.19502155795575],
    [ -120.80017089843749, 36.54053616262899],
    [ -120.67932128906249, 36.33725319397006]
 ]
}
----

=== MultiLineString (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.5[RFC 7946: 3.1.5])

The following specifies a GeoJSON MultiLineString field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{
 "type": "MultiLineString",
 "coordinates": [
    [ [ -118.31726074, 35.250105158],[ -117.509765624, 35.3756141] ],
    [ [ -118.6962890, 34.624167789],[ -118.317260742, 35.03899204] ],
    [ [ -117.9492187, 35.146862906], [ -117.6745605, 34.41144164] ]
]
}
----

=== MultiPolygon (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.7[RFC 7946: 3.1.7])

The following specifies a GeoJSON MultiPolygon field in a document:

[source, json]
----
{
 "type": "MultiPolygon",
 "coordinates": [
    [ [ [ -73.958, 40.8003 ], [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ], 
        [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ], [ -73.9814, 40.7681 ], 
        [ -73.958, 40.8003 ] ] ],


    [ [ [ -73.958, 40.8003 ], [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ], 
        [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ], [ -73.958, 40.8003 ] ] ]
 ]
}
----

=== GeometryCollection (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946#section-3.1.8[RFC 7946: 3.1.8])

The following specifies a GeoJSON GeometryCollection field in a document:
A GeometryCollection has a member with the name "geometries".  The value of "geometries" is an array.  Each element of this array is a GeoJSON Geometry object.    It is possible for this array to be empty.

Unlike the other geometry types described above, a GeometryCollection can be a heterogeneous composition of smaller Geometry objects.  For example, a Geometry object in the shape of a lowercase roman "i" can be composed of one point and one LineString.
Nested  GeometryCollections are invalid.  

[source, json]
----
{
 "type": "GeometryCollection",
 "geometries": [
    {
      "type": "MultiPoint",
      "coordinates": [
         [ -73.9580, 40.8003 ],
         [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ],
         [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ],
         [ -73.9814, 40.7681 ]
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "MultiLineString",
      "coordinates": [
         [ [ -73.96943, 40.78519 ], [ -73.96082, 40.78095 ] ],
         [ [ -73.96415, 40.79229 ], [ -73.95544, 40.78854 ] ],
         [ [ -73.97162, 40.78205 ], [ -73.96374, 40.77715 ] ],
         [ [ -73.97880, 40.77247 ], [ -73.97036, 40.76811 ] ]
      ]
    },
    {
      "type" : "Polygon",
      "coordinates" : [
    [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 3 , 6 ] , [ 6 , 1 ] , [ 0 , 0 ] ],
    [ [ 2 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ]
    ]
   }
]
}
----

=== Envelope (Couchbase specific extension)

Envelope type, which consists of coordinates for upper left and lower right points of the shape to represent a bounding rectangle in the format: +++[[minLon, maxLat], [maxLon, minLat]]+++.

[source, json]
----
{
    "type": "envelope",
    "coordinates": [
      [72.83, 18.979],
      [78.508, 17.4555]
    ]
}
----

=== Circle (Couchbase specific extension)

If the user wishes to cover a circular region over earth’s surface, then they could use this shape.
A  sample circular shape is as below.

[source, json]
----
{ 
 "type": "circle", 
 "coordinates": [75.05687713623047,22.53539059204079],
 "radius": "1000m"
}
----
 
Circle is specified over the center point coordinates along with the radius (or distance).

Example formats supported for radius are: 
"5in" , "5inch" , "7yd" , "7yards",  "9ft" , "9feet", "11km", "11kilometers", "3nm" "3nauticalmiles", "13mm" , "13millimeters",  "15cm", "15centimeters", "17mi", "17miles" "19m" or "19meters".

[#specifying-distances]
== Distances

Multiple unit-types can be used to express the radius (or distance) of the *Circle* type.
These are listed in the table below, with the strings that specify them in REST queries.

[#geospatial-distance-units,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Units | Specify with

| inches
| `in` or `inch`

| feet
| `ft` or `feet`

| yards
| `yd` or `yards`

| miles
| `mi` or `miles`

| nautical miles
| `nm` or `nauticalmiles`

| millimeters
| `mm` or `millimeters`

| centimeters
| `cm` or `centimeters`

| meters
| `m` or `meters`

| kilometers
| `km` or `kilometers`

|===

The integer used to specify the number of units must precede the unit-name, with no space left in-between.
For example, _five inches_ can be specified either by the string `"5in"`, or by the string `"5inches"`; while _thirteen nautical miles_ can be specified as either `"13nm"` or `"13nauticalmiles"`.

If the unit cannot be determined, the entire string is parsed, and the distance is assumed to be in _meters_.

= Querying the GeoJSON spatial fields

Search primarily supports three types of spatial querying capability across those heterogeneous types of geoshapes indexed this is accomplished via a JSON Query Structure.

== Query Structure:

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "field": " << fieldName >> ",
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "type": " << shapeDesc >> ", 
        "coordinates": [[[ ]]]
      },
      "relation": " << relation >> "
    }
  }
}
----

The item *fieldName* is the indexed field to apply the Query Structure against.

The item *shapeDesc* can be any of the 9 types like Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection, Circle and Envelope.

The item *relation* can be any of the 3 types like intersects , contains and within.

[#geospatial-distance-units,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Relation | Result

| INTERSECTS
| Return all documents whose spatial field intersects the query  geometry.

| CONTAINS
| Return all documents whose spatial field contains the query geometry

| WITHIN
| Return all documents whose spatial field is within the query geometry.

|===


== Sample Query Structures

=== A point `contains` query 

The `contains` query for point returns all the matched documents with shapes that contain the given point in the query. 

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
  "field": "<<fieldName>>",
  "geometry": {
    "shape": {
      "type": "point",
      "coordinates": [75.05687713623047, 22.53539059204079]
    },
    "relation": "contains"
    }
  }
}
----
 
 
=== lineString `intersects` query

An `intersect` query for linestring returns all the matched documents with shapes that intersects with the linestring in the query. 

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
  "field": "<<fieldName>>",
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "type": "linestring",
        "coordinates": [
          [77.01416015625, 23.079731762449878],
          [78.134765625, 20.385825381874263]
        ]
      },
      "relation": "intersects"
    }
  }
}
----


=== Polygon `WithIn` Query

A `within` query for polygon returns all the matched documents with shapes that are residing completely within the area of the polygon in the query. 

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
  "field": "<<fieldName>>",
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "type": "polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [77.59012699127197, 12.959853852513307],
            [77.59836673736572, 12.959853852513307],
            [77.59836673736572, 12.965541604118611],
            [77.59012699127197, 12.965541604118611],
            [77.59012699127197, 12.959853852513307]
          ]
        ]
      },
      "relation": "within"
    }
  }
}
----


[#creating_a_geojson_index]
[#creating_a_geojson_geopoint_index]
== Creating a Geospatial Index (type geojson)

To be successful, a geospatial GeoJSON query must reference an index that applies the _geojson_ type mapping to the field containing any of the standard types *Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection* plus the extended types of *Circle and Envelope*.

This can be achieved with Couchbase Web Console, or with the REST endpoints provided for managing xref:rest-api:rest-fts-indexing.adoc[Indexes].
Detailed instructions for setting up indexes, and specifying type mappings, are provided in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

include::partial$fts-creating-geojson-common.adoc[]















The index once created can also be accessed by means of the Search REST API
see xref:fts-searching-with-curl-http-requests.adoc[Searching with the REST API].  Furthermore the index could have been created in the first place via the Search REST API see xref:fts-creating-index-with-rest-api.adoc[Index Creation with REST API] for more information on using the Search REST API syntax.

[#creating_geojson_rest_query_radius_based]
== Creating a Query: Radius-Based

This section and those following, provide examples of the query-bodies required to make geospatial queries with the Couchbase REST API.
Note that more detailed information on performing queries with the Couchbase REST API can be found in xref:fts-searching-with-the-rest-api.adoc[Searching with the REST API]; which shows how to use the full `curl` command and how to incorporate query-bodies into it.

The following query-body specifies a longitude of `-2.235143` and a latitude of `53.482358`.
The target-field `geo` is specified, as is a `distance` of `100` miles: this is the radius within which target-locations must reside for their documents to be returned.

[source, json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "coordinates": [
          -2.235143,
          53.482358
        ],
        "type": "circle",
        "radius": "100mi"
      },
      "relation": "within"
    },
    "field": "geojson"
  },
  "size": 10,
  "from": 0,
  "sort": [
    {
      "by": "geo_distance",
      "field": "geojson",
      "unit": "mi",
      "location": {
        "lon": -2.235143,
        "lat": 53.482358
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The above query contains a `sort` object, which specifies that the returned documents should be ordered in terms of their _geo_distance_ from specified `lon` and `lat` coordinates: these values need not be identical to those specified in the `query` object.

image::fts-geojson-search_01.png[,550,align=left]
You can cut-n-paste the above Search body definition into the text area that says "search this index..."

image::fts-geojson-search_02.png[,550,align=left]
Once pasted hit the *Search* button and the UI will show the first 10 hits

image::fts-geojson-search_03.png[,,align=left]
The console allows searches performed via the UI to be translated dynamically into cURL examples.
To create a cURL command to do this first check *[X] show advanced query settings* and then check *[X] show command-line query example*.

You should have a cURL command similar to the following:

[source, console]
----
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-u <username>:<password> http://192.168.3.150:8094/api/index/test_geojson/query \
-d '{
  "query": {
    "geometry": {
      "shape": {
        "coordinates": [
          -2.235143,
          53.482358
        ],
        "type": "circle",
        "radius": "100mi"
      },
      "relation": "within"
    },
    "field": "geojson"
  },
  "size": 10,
  "from": 0,
  "sort": [
    {
      "by": "geo_distance",
      "field": "geojson",
      "unit": "mi",
      "location": {
        "lon": -2.235143,
        "lat": 53.482358
      }
    }
  ]
}'
----

If you copy and then run the above cURL command via the console the response from the Search service will report that there are 847 total_hits but only return the first 10 hits.  A subset of formatted console output might appear as follows:

NOTE: To pretty print the response just pipe the output through the utility http://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq] to enhance readability.

[#creating_geojson_rest_query_bounding_box_based]
== Creating a Query: Rectangle-Based

In the following query-body, the `top_left` of a rectangle is expressed by means of an array of two floating-point numbers, specifying a longitude of `-2.235143` and a latitude of `53.482358`.
The `bottom_right` is expressed by means of key-value pairs, specifying a longitude of `28.955043` and a latitude of `40.991862`.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.

[#creating_geojson_rest_query_polygon_based]
== Creating a Query: Polygon-Based

The following query-body uses an array, each of whose elements is a string, containing two floating-point numbers; to specify the latitude and longitude of each of the corners of a polygon &#8212; known as _polygon points_.
In each string, the `lat` floating-point value precedes the `lon.`

Here, the last-specified string in the array is identical to the initial string, thus explicitly closing the box.
However, specifying an explicit closure in this way is optional: closure will be inferred by Couchbase Server if not explicitly specified.

If a target data-location falls within the box, its document is returned.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.
