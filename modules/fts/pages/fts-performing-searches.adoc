[#topic_fts_conducting_searches]
= Performing Searches

[abstract]
Following appropriate preparations, Full Text Searches can be performed in a number of ways.

[#preparing-for-full-text-searches]
== Preparing for Full Text Searches

Before attempting a Full Text Search, you must:

* Ensure that Couchbase Server has the _Search_ service appropriately enabled.
Enablement for a given node must occur as part of that node's configuration.
See xref:install:init-setup.adoc[Initializing the Cluster] for information.

* Create an appropriate index.
This can be accomplished by means of the Couchbase Web Console.
For a simple example of index-creation, which allows you to get started quickly, see xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI].
For a more detailed explanation of the available options, including index-creation by means of the Couchbase REST API, see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

Note that during index-creation, in support of most query-types, you can select (or create) and use an _analyzer_.
This is optional: if you do not specify an analyzer, a default analyzer is provided.
Analyzers can be created by means of the Couchbase Web Console, during index-creation, as described in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
Their functionality and inner components are described in detail in xref:fts-using-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

[#performing-full-text-searches]
== Performing Full Text Searches

Full Text Searches can be performed with:

* The Couchbase Web Console.
This UI can also be used to create indexes and analyzers.
See xref:fts-searching-from-the-ui.adoc[Searching from the UI], for information.

* The Couchbase REST API.
See xref:fts-searching-with-the-rest-api.adoc[Searching with the REST API], for information.
See also the page containing REST reference information, xref:rest-api:rest-fts.adoc[Full Text Search API].

* The Couchbase SDK.
This supports seven languages, and allows Full Text Searches to be performed with each.
See the SDK's xref:sdk:full-text-search-overview.adoc[Full Text Search] page, for information.
Note also that the xref:sdk:java/full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK] page for the _Java_ SDK provides an extensive code-example that demonstrates multiple options for performing Full Text Searches.
(See immediately below for more information.)

[#establishing-demonstration-indexes]
== Establishing Demonstration Indexes

The Java SDK code-example provided in xref:sdk:java/full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching with the SDK] contains multiple demonstration calls — each featuring a different query-combination — and makes use of three different index-definitions, related to the `travel-sample` bucket: for the code example to run successfully, the three indexes must be appropriately pre-established.
The definitions are provided in xref:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes].
Instructions on how to use the Couchbase REST API to establish the definitions are provided in the section _Index-Creation with the REST API_, on the page xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#index-creation-with-the-rest-api[Creating Indexes].
