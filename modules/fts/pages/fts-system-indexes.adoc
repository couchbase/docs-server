= System:indexes - FTS indexes which are eligible to be queried from {sqlpp}

Use the following command to find all the FTS indexes in the system table that can be queried from {sqlpp}.

----
SELECT * FROM system:indexes

An additional link describes various scenarios in which the FTS Index becomes ineligible to be queried by {sqlpp}.

xref:n1ql/pages/n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc#limitations[Scenarios where FTS Index becomes ineligible to be queried by {sqlpp}]

NOTE: Querying system:indexes only returns indexes on non-system keyspaces. To return all indexes, including indexes on system keyspaces, use the query system:all_indexes.
