= FTS indexes which may be queried from N1QL

Use the following command to find all the FTS indexes in the system table that can be queried from N1QL.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT * FROM system:indexes
----

Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc#limitations[Limitations] for scenarios where FTS Index becomes ineligible to be queried by N1QL.
 
NOTE: Querying `system:indexes` only returns indexes on non-system keyspaces. To return all indexes, including indexes on system keyspaces, query `system:all_indexes`.
