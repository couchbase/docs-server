= Geospatial Queries

[abstract]
Geospatial queries return documents that contain location-data.

[#introduction-to-geospatial-querying]
== Introduction to Geospatial Querying

A _geospatial query_ specifies an area, and returns each document that contains a reference to a location within the area.
Areas and locations are represented by means of _latitude_-_longitude_ coordinate pairs.

This allows an application, based on the user's input of a particular coordinate, address, or property name, to derive a list of _points of interest_ that lie within an area that surrounds the user-referenced location; and display these for the user's benefit.

A geospatial query can specify an area by means of:

* A location, expressed as a latitude-longitude coordinate pair; and a distance, in miles.
The location determines the center of a circle whose radius-length is the specified distance.
Documents are returned if they reference a location within the circle.

* Two latitude-longitude coordinate pairs.
These are respectively taken to indicate the top left and bottom right corners of a _rectangular_ bounding box.
Documents are returned if they reference a location within the box.

* An array of three of more latitude-longitude coordinate pairs.
Each of the pairs is taken to indicate one corner of a _polygonal_ bounding box.
Documents are returned if they reference a location within the box.

To be successful, a geospatial query must reference an index within which the _geopoint_ type mapping has been applied to the field containing the target latitude-longitude coordinate pair.

Geospatial queries return _all_ documents whose locations are within the query-specified area.
To specify _holes_ within the area, so that one or more subsets of returned documents can be omitted from the final results, boolean queries should be applied to the set of documents returned by the geospatial query.
See xref:fts:fts-query-types.adoc[Query Types].

For any geospatial query, latitude-longitude coordinate pairs can also be specified as _geohashes_, as demonstrated in xref:fts:fts-geospatial-queries.adoc#specifying-polygon-points[Specifying Polygon Points], below.

[#recognizing_target_data]
== Recognizing Target Data

The `travel-sample` bucket, provided for test and development, contains multiple documents that specify locations.
For example, those that represent airports, such as `airport_1254`:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
  "city": "Calais",
  "country": "France",
  "faa": "CQF",
  "geo": {
    "alt": 12,
    "lat": 50.962097,
    "lon": 1.954764
  },
  "icao": "LFAC",
  "id": 1254,
  "type": "airport",
  "tz": "Europe/Paris"
}
----

The `geo` field contains the `lon` and `lat` key-value pairs.
Such a parent-field is accessed directly by a geospatial query: the internal `long` and `lat` child-fields are not explicitly specified.
Moreover, any other child-field, such as `alt`, is ignored.

For information on installing the `travel-sample` bucket, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

[#creating_a_geospatial_index]
== Creating a Geospatial Index

To be successful, a geospatial query must reference an index that applies the _geopoint_ type mapping to the field containing the latitude-longitude coordinate pair.
This can be achieved by means of Couchbase Web Console.
Detailed instructions for setting up indexes, and specifying type mappings, are provided in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
For initial experimentation with geospatial querying, the `geo` field of documents within the `travel-sample` bucket can be specified as a child field of the `default` type mapping, as follows:

[#fts_geopoint_definition]
image::fts-geopoint-definition.png[,620,align=left]

The index so created can also be specified by means of the Couchbase REST API.
See xref:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes] for the body of the index to be used, and see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#index-creation-with-the-rest-api[Index-Creation with the REST API] for information on using the REST syntax.

[#creating_geospatial_rest_query_radius_based]
== Creating a Query: Radius-Based

This section and those following provide examples of the query-bodies required to make geospatial queries with the Couchbase REST API.
Note that more detailed information on performing queries with the Couchbase REST API can be found in xref:fts-searching-with-the-rest-api.adoc[Searching with the REST API]; which shows how to use the full `curl` command, and how to incorporate query-bodies into it.

The following query-body specifies a longitude of `-2.235143`, and a latitude of `53.482358`.
The target-field `geo` is specified, as is a `distance` of `100` miles: this is the radius within which target-locations must reside, for their documents to be returned.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "location": {
      "lon": -2.235143,
      "lat": 53.482358
     },
      "distance": "100mi",
      "field": "geo"
    },
  "sort": [
    {
      "by": "geo_distance",
      "field": "geo",
      "unit": "mi",
      "location": {
      "lon": -2.235143,
      "lat": 53.482358
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The query contains a `sort` object, which specifies that the returned documents should be ordered in terms of their _geo_distance_ from specified `lon` and `lat` coordinates: these values need not be identical to those specified in the `query` object.

A subset of formatted console output might appear as follows:

[#creating_geospatial_rest_query_bounding_box_based]
== Creating a Query: Rectangle-Based

The following query body forms the `top_left` corner of a _bounding box_, specifying a longitude of `-2.235143` and a latitude of `53.482358`.
This demonstrates use of an _array_ to specify the coordinate pair: this option can be used interchangeably with that of using key-value pairs, whenever longitude and latitude are to be specified.
Note that in the array, the `lon` value must precede the `lat`.

The `bottom_right` of the bounding box is formed by means of key-value pairs; specifying a longitude of `28.955043` and a latitude of `40.991862`.

If a target data-location falls within the box, its document is returned.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.

[#creating_geospatial_rest_query_polygon_based]
== Creating a Query: Polygon-Based

The following query body uses an array, containing multiple latitude-longitude pairs, to specify each of the corners of a _polygonal_ bounding box &#8212; known as _polygon points_.
In each pair, the `lat` value precedes the `lon`.

Here, the last-specified pair in the array is identical to the initial pair, thus explicitly closing the box.
However, specifying an explicit closure in this way is optional: closure will be inferred by Couchbase Server, if not explicitly specified.

If a target data-location falls within the box, its document is returned.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.
