= Geospatial Queries

[abstract]
Geospatial queries return documents that contain location-data.

[#introduction-to-geospatial-querying]
== Introduction to Geospatial Querying

A _geospatial query_ specifies a location, and returns each document that contains a proximity-match.
A location is represented by means of _longitude_-_latitude_ coordinate pairs.

This allows an application, based on the user's input of a particular coordinate, address, or property name, to derive a list of _points of interest_ that lie within a specified distance of the user-referenced location; and display these for the user's benefit.

The location-data provided by a geospatial query can be either of the following:

* A location, specified as a longitude-latitude coordinate pair; and a distance, in miles.
The location determines the center of a circle whose radius-length is the specified distance.
Documents are returned if they reference a location within the circle.
* Two longitude-latitude coordinate pairs.
These are respectively taken to indicate the top left and bottom right corners of a bounding box.
Documents are returned if they reference a location within the box.

To be successful, a geospatial query must reference an index within which the _geopoint_ type mapping has been applied to the field containing the target longitude-latitude coordinate pair.

[#recognizing_target_data]
== Recognizing Target Data

The `travel-sample` bucket, provided for test and development, contains multiple documents that specify locations.
For example, those that represent airports, such as `airport_1254`:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
  "city": "Calais",
  "country": "France",
  "faa": "CQF",
  "geo": {
    "alt": 12,
    "lat": 50.962097,
    "lon": 1.954764
  },
  "icao": "LFAC",
  "id": 1254,
  "type": "airport",
  "tz": "Europe/Paris"
}
----

The `geo` field contains the `lon` and `lat` key-value pairs.
Such a parent-field is accessed directly by a geospatial query: the internal `long` and `lat` child-fields are not explicitly specified.
Moreover, any other child-field, such as `alt`, is ignored.

For information on installing the `travel-sample` bucket, see
xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

[#creating_a_geospatial_index]
== Creating a Geospatial Index

To be successful, a geospatial query must reference an index that applies the _geopoint_ type mapping to the field containing the longitude-latitude coordinate pair.
This can be achieved by means of the Couchbase Web Console.
Detailed instructions for setting up indexes, and specifying type mappings, are provided in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
For initial experimentation with geospatial querying, the `geo` field of documents within the `travel-sample` bucket can be specified as a child field of the `default` type mapping, as follows:

[#fts_geopoint_definition]
image::fts-geopoint-definition.png[,620,align=left]

The index so created can also be specified by means of the Couchbase REST API.
See xref:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes] for the body of the index to be used, and see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc#index-creation-with-the-rest-api[Index-Creation with the REST API] for information on using the REST syntax.

[#creating_geospatial_rest_query_radius_based]
== Creating a Query: Radius-Based

This section and the following provide examples of the query-bodies required to make geospatial queries with the Couchbase REST API.
Note that more detailed information on performing queries with the Couchbase REST API can be found in xref:fts-searching-with-the-rest-api.adoc[Searching with the REST API]; which shows how to use the full `curl` command, and how to incorporate query-bodies into it.

The following query-body specifies a longitude of `-2.235143`, and a latitude of `53.482358`.
The target-field `geo` is specified, as is a `distance` of `100` miles: this is the radius within which target-locations must reside, for their documents to be returned.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 10,
  "query": {
    "location": {
      "lon": -2.235143,
      "lat": 53.482358
     },
      "distance": "100mi",
      "field": "geo"
    },
  "sort": [
    {
      "by": "geo_distance",
      "field": "geo",
      "unit": "mi",
      "location": {
      "lon": -2.235143,
      "lat": 53.482358
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The query contains a `sort` object, which specifies that the returned documents should be ordered in terms of their _geo_distance_ from specified `lon` and `lat` coordinates: these values need not be identical to those specified in the `query` object.

A subset of formatted console output might appear as follows:

[#creating_geospatial_rest_query_bounding_box_based]
== Creating a Query: Box-Based

The following query body forms the `top_left` corner of a _bounding box_, specifying a longitude of `-2.235143` and a latitude of `53.482358`.
This demonstrates use of an _array_ to specify the coordinate pair: this option can be used interchangeably with that of using key-value pairs, whenever longitude and latitude are to be specified.
Note that in the array, the `lon` value must precede the `lat`.

The `bottom_right` of the bounding box is formed by means of key-value pairs; specifying a longitude of `28.955043` and a latitude of `40.991862`.

If a target data-location falls within the box, its document is returned.
The results are specified to be sorted on `name` alone.

    "top_left": [-2.235143, 53.482358],

      "lon": 28.955043,
