= Configure Index Options

In Full Text Search, you can create an index just by specifying the index name and selecting the source bucket, scope and collection for the index. However, FTS provides various configurations for the index to enhance the search experience.

While creating an index or after creating an index, you can configure various options for your index. Based on the configuration of the index, a user can search in a more selective and efficient manner.
