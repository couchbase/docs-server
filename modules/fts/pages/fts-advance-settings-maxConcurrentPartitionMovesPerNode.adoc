= maxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode 

During the rebalance operations, FTS moves or builds partitions one at a time per node. This process can significantly increase the overall time taken for the rebalance operation. So, the way to speed up the rebalance operation is to enable the movement of partitions parallelly.

The `maxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode` setting can bring the additional concurrency to moving or building partitions during a rebalance operation. 

Setting the `maxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode` to *N* as a runtime cluster option can concurrently build the N number of partitions in parallel per node at a time and help in completing the rebalancing faster.

Setting `maxFeedsPerDCPAgent` to 1 with a sufficient FTS memory quota can help to maximize the rebalancing throughput.

== Example

*Speed Up the Rebalance operation*:

* 	Set `maxConcurrentPartitionMovesPerNode` to any number, for example 10, to bring additional concurrency:
