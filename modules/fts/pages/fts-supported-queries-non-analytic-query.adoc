= Non-Analytic Queries

Non-analytic queries do not support analysis on their inputs.
This means that only exact matches are returned.

The following queries are non-Analytic queries:

* xref:fts-supported-queries-term.adoc[Term]
* xref:fts-supported-queries-phrase.adoc[Phrase]
* xref:fts-supported-queries-prefix-query.adoc[Prefix]
* xref:fts-supported-queries-regexp.adoc[Regexp]
* xref:fts-supported-queries-fuzzy.adoc[Fuzzy]
* xref:fts-supported-queries-wildcard.adoc[Wildcard]

In most cases, given the benefits of using analyzers, use of match and match phrase queries is preferable to that of term and phrase.
For information on analyzers, see xref:fts-index-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].
