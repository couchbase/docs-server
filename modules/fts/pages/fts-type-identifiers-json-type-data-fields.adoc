= JSON type field 
It is the name of a document-field. The value specified for this field is used by the index to determine the type of the document. The default value is type: meaning that the index searches for a field in each document whose name is type. Each document that contains a field with that name is duly included in the index, with the value of the field specifying the type of the document. Note that the value cannot be an array or JSON object.
