= Understanding Analyzers

[abstract]
Analyzers increase search-awareness by transforming input text into token-streams, which permit the management of richer and more finely controlled forms of text-matching.
An analyzer consists of modules, each of which performs a particular, sequenced role in the transformation.

[#principles-of-text-analysis]
== Principles of Text-Analysis

_Analyzers_ pre-process input-text submitted for Full Text Search; typically, by removing characters that might prohibit certain match-options.
Analysis is performed on document-contents when indexes are created; and is also performed on the input-text submitted for a search.
The benefit of analysis is often referred to as _language awareness_.

For example, if the input-text for a search is `enjoyed staying here`, and the document-content contains the phrase `many enjoyable activities`, the dictionary-based words do not permit a match.
However, by using an analyzer that (by means of its inner _Token Filter_ component) _stems_ words, the input-text yields the tokens `enjoy`, `stay`, and `here`; while the document-content yields the tokens `enjoy` and `activ`.
By means of the common token `enjoy`, this permits a match between `enjoyed` and `enjoyable`.

Since different analyzers pre-process text in different ways, effective Full Text Search depends on the right choice of analyzer, for the type of matches that are desired.

Couchbase Full Text Search provides a number of pre-constructed analyzers that can be used with Full Text Indexes.
Additionally, analyzers can be custom-created, by means of the Couchbase Web Console.
The remainder of this page explains the architecture of analyzers, and describes the modular components that Couchbase Full Text Search makes available for custom-creation.
It also lists the pre-constructed analyzers that are available, and describes the modules that they contain.

For examples of both selecting and custom-creating analyzers by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

[#analyzer-architecture]
== Analyzer Architecture

Analyzers are built from modular components:

* *Character Filters* remove undesirable characters from input: for example, the `html` character filter removes HTML tags, and indexes HTML text-content alone.
* *Tokenizers* split input-strings into individual _tokens_, which together are made into a _token stream_.
The nature of the decision-making whereby splits are made differs across tokenizers.
* *Token Filters* are chained together, with each performing additional post-processing on each token in the stream provided by the tokenizer.
This may include reducing tokens to the _stems_ of the dictionary-based words from which they were derived, removing any remaining punctuation from tokens, and removing certain tokens deemed unnecessary.

Each component-type is described in more detail below.
Note that these components can be used to custom-create an analyzer by means of the Couchbase Web Console.
This is explained and exemplified in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

[#character-filters]
== Character Filters

_Character Filters_ remove undesirable characters.
The following filters are available:

* *html*: Removes html elements such as `<p>`, and decodes expressions such as `+&amp;+` to their appropriate text equivalent.

* *zero_width_spaces*: Substitutes a regular space-character for each _zero-width non-joiner_ space.

[#tokenizers]
== Tokenizers

Tokenizers split input-strings into individual tokens: characters likely to prohibit certain kinds of matching (for example, spaces or commas) are omitted.
The tokens so created are then made into a _token stream_ for the query.

The following tokenizers are available from the Couchbase Web Console:

* *Letter*: Creates tokens by breaking input-text into subsets that consist of letters only: characters such as punctuation-marks and numbers are omitted.
Creation of a token ends whenever a non-letter character is encountered.
For example, the text `Reqmnt: 7-element phrase` would return the following tokens: `Reqmnt`, `element`, and `phrase`.

* *Single*: Creates a single token from the entirety of the input-text.
For example, the text `in each place` would return the following token: `in each place`.
Note that this may be useful for handling URLs or email-addresses, which can thus be prevented from being broken at punctuation or special-character boundaries.
It may also be used to prevent multi-word phrases (for example, placenames such as `Milton Keynes` or `San Francisco`) from being broken up due to whitespace; so that they become indexed as a single term.

* *Unicode*: Creates tokens by performing _Unicode Text Segmentation_ on word-boundaries, using the https://github.com/blevesearch/segment[segment] library.
For examples, see xref:http:http:/www.unicode.org/reports/tr29.adoc#Word_Boundaries[Unicode Word Boundaries].

* *Web*: Creates tokens by identifying and removing html tags.
For example, the text `<h1>Introduction<\h1>` would return the token `Introduction`.

* *Whitespace*: Creates tokens by breaking input-text into subsets according to where whitespace occurs.
For example, the text `in each place ` would return the following tokens: `in`, `each`, and `place`.

[#token-filters]
== Token Filters

_Token Filters_ accept a token-stream provided by a tokenizer, and make modifications to the tokens in the stream.

A frequently used form of token filtering is _stemming_; this reduces words to a base form that typically consists of the initial _stem_ of the word (for example, `play`, which is the stem of `player`, `playing`, `playable`, and more).
With the stem used as the token, a wider variety of matches can be made (for example, the input-text `player` can be matched with the document-content `playable`).

The following kinds of token-filtering are supported by Couchbase Full Text Search:

* *dict_compoound*: Allows user-specification of a dictionary whose words can be combined into compound forms, and individually indexed.

* *apostrophe*: Removes all characters after an apostrophe, and the apostrophe itself.
For example, `they've` becomes `they`.

* *elision*: Identifies and removes characters that prefix a term and are separated from it by an apostrophe.
For example, in French, `l'avion` becomes `avion`.

* *edge_ngram*: From each token, computes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram[n-grams] that are rooted either at the front or the back.

* *keyword_marker*: Identifies keywords and marks them as such.
These are then ignored by any downstream stemmer.

* *normalize_unicode*: Converts tokens into http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization Form].

* *ngram*: From each token, computes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram[n-grams].
There are two parameters, which are the minimum and maximum n-gram length.

* *shingle*: Computes multi-token shingles from the token stream.
For example, the token stream `the quick brown fox`, when configured with a shingle minimum and a shingle maximum length of 2, produces the tokens `the quick`, `quick brown`, and `brown fox`.

* *stemmer*: Uses http://snowball.tartarus.org/[libstemmer] to reduce tokens to word-stems.

* *stop_tokens*: Removes from the stream tokens considered unnecessary for a Full Text Search: for example, `and`, `is`, and `the`.

* *to_lower*: Converts all characters to lower case.
For example, `HTML` becomes `html`.

* *truncate*: Truncates each token to a maximum-permissible token-length.

* *possessive*: Removes English possessives.
For example, `software's` becomes `software`.

Note that token filters are frequently configured according to the special characteristics of individual languages.
Couchbase Full Text Search provides multiple language-specific versions of the *elision*, *normalize*, *stemmer*, *possessive*, and *stop* token filters.
Specially supported languages are shown in the table immediately below.

[#pre-constructed-analyzers]
== Pre-Constructed Analyzers

A number of pre-constructed analyzers are available, and can be selected from the Couchbase Web Console.
For examples of selection, see xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
The basic analyzers are as follows.
See the sections above for details on the referenced analyzer-components.

* *keyword*: Creates a single token representing the entire input, which is otherwise unchanged.
This forces exact matches, and preserves characters such as spaces.

* *simple*: Analysis by means of the *Unicode* tokenizer and the *to_lower* token filter.

* *standard*: Analysis by means of the *Unicode* tokenizer, the *to_lower* token filter, and the *stop* token filter.

* *web*: Analysis by means of the *Web* tokenizer and the  *to_lower* token filter.

Additionally, a range of analyzers is provided for the specific support of certain languages; as shown by the table immediately below.
