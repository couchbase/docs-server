For a more detailed explanation of the available Query options, refer to xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI]

NOTE: During index creation, in support of most query-types, you can select (or create) and use an _analyzer_.
This is optional: if you do not specify an analyzer, a default analyzer is provided.
Analyzers can be created by means of the Couchbase Web Console, during index creation, as described in xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].
Their functionality and inner components are described in detail in xref:fts-analyzers.adoc[Understanding Analyzers].

[#performing-full-text-searches]
== Performing Full Text Searches

Full text searches can be performed with:

* The Couchbase Web Console.
This UI can also be used to create indexes and analyzers.
Refer to xref:fts-searching-from-the-UI.adoc[Searching from the UI] for information.
* The Couchbase REST API.
Refer to xref:fts-searching-with-curl-http-requests.adoc#Searching-with-the-REST-API-(cURL/HTTP)[Searching with the REST API] for information.
Refer also to xref:rest-api:rest-fts.adoc[Full Text Search API] for REST reference details.
* The Couchbase SDK.
This supports several languages, and allows full text searches to be performed with each.
Refer to the SDK's xref:java-sdk:concept-docs:full-text-search-overview.adoc[Full Text Search] page for information.
Note that the xref:java-sdk:howtos:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK] page for the _Java_ SDK provides an extensive code-example that demonstrates multiple options for performing full text searches.
//(Refer to <<establishing-demonstration-indexes>> below for more information.)
* The N1QL Search functions.
These enable you to perform a full text search as part of a N1QL query.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc[Search Functions] for information.

[#establishing-demonstration-indexes]
== Establishing Demonstration Indexes

The Java SDK code-example provided in xref:java-sdk:howtos:full-text-searching-with-sdk.adoc[Searching from the SDK] contains multiple demonstration calls — each featuring a different query-combination — and makes use of three different index-definitions, related to the `travel-sample` bucket: for the code example to run successfully, the three indexes must be appropriately pre-established.
//The definitions are provided in xref:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes].
Instructions on how to use the Couchbase REST API to establish the definitions refer to xref:fts-creating-index-with-rest-api.adoc[Creating Index with REST API].
