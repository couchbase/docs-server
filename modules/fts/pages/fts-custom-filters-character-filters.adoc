The new filter becomes available for inclusion in custom-created analyzers.

The following interactive fields are provided:

 ** *Name*: A suitable, user-defined name for the new character filter.
 ** *Type*: The type of filtering to be performed.
Available options can be accessed from the pull-down menu, at the right of the field.
(Currently, only `regexp` is available.)
 ** *Regular Expression*: The specific _regular expression_ that the new character filter is to apply.
Character-strings that match the expression will be affected, others will not.
 ** *Replacement*: The replacement text that will be substituted for each character-string match returned by the regular expression.
If no replacement text is specified, the matched character-string will be omitted.
