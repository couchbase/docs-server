= Specifying fields for Type Mapping

A Full Text Index can be defined not only to include (or exclude) documents of a certain type but also to include (or exclude) specified fields within each of the typed documents.

To specify one or more fields, hover with the mouse cursor over a row in the Type Mappings panel that contains an enabled type mapping. Buttons labeled *edit* and *+* appear:

Left-clicking on the *edit* button displays the following interface:

This allows the mapping to be deleted or associated with a different analyzer. 

NOTE: FTS Indexing does not work for fields having a dot (. or period) in the field name. Users must avoid adding dot (. or period) in the field name. Like using `field.name` or `country.name` is not supported. For example, `{ "database.name": "couchbase"}`

If the *only index specified fields* checkbox is checked, only fields specified by the user are included in the index.

Left-clicking on the *+* button displays a pop-up that features two options:

These options are described in the following sections.
