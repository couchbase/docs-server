= Specifying fields for Type Mapping

A Full Text Index can be defined not only to include (or exclude) documents of a certain type but also to include (or exclude) specified fields within each of the typed documents.

To specify one or more fields, hover with the mouse cursor over a row in the Type Mappings panel that contains an enabled type mapping. Buttons labeled edit and + appear:

Left-clicking on the edit button displays the following interface:

This allows the mapping to be deleted or associated with a different analyzer. If the only index specified fields checkbox is checked, only fields specified by the user are included in the index. Left-clicking on the + button displays a pop-up that features two options:
