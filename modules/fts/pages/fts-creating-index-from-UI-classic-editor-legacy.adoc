= Classic Editor

[abstract]

A classic editor is an advanced tool where users can directly configure the index mapping. 

This section introduces index creations via a step by step walk through using the classic editor.  The reader should be already familiar with the basic concepts of full-text search 

This example xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc#main[Creating a Legacy Index] provides a simple introduction to using Search, however it is not optimized nor does it expose many useful features that the Search service supports.  
This example only runs on the _default scope/collection (created when migrating bucket data into collections) and should be considered a legacy mode. This example is compatible with the  pre collections bucket based paridigm.

The example xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-advanced.adoc#main[Creating an One Field Index] example starts to introduce advanced feature for optimizing and using a focused Search index. 
However it should be noted that it only scratches the surface anddoes not cover: adding multiple collections under a scope; adding multiple field or fields from sub-objects; alternative analyzers, and geospatial features.

= Creating a Legacy Index

This section describes creating an Index on a bucket's *_default* scope/collection.  This collection is created when upgrading from Buckets to Collections.

To create a basic Search index on the _default collection, through the Classic Editor:

* Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click the *Add Index* link in the upper right.

* To define any index on which Full Text Search a unique name for the index in the *Index Name* field, on the upper-left. Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names and the first character of the name must be alphabetic. 
+
Enter *travel-sample-index* as the name of the Search index you are creating in the *Index Name* text-box.
+

* Select the bucket *travel-sample* from the *Bucket* pull-down menu.
+
Use the pull-down menu provided for the Bucket field, on the upper-right, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+

* Save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen.
+
This is all you need to specify in order to create a basic index for test and development. No further configuration is required.

* If you subsequently Edit your Index it should look like the following:

== Test the Legacy Index with a simple query

In the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click on the index you just created (named "landmark-content-index") to expand the Index's controls.

* In the text area of the search box enter *+view +food +beach* this will search on all three keywords

* Click on the blue *Search* button. You will get documents from both type hotel and type landmark

NOTE: Creating default indexes as above indexes across all fields is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.
