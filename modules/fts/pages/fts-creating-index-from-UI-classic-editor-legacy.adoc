= Classic Editor

[abstract]

The classic editor is the most advanced tool where users can directly configure the index mapping with all capabilities. 

You can build the exact same index via the command line use the REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-legacy.adoc[Creating a Legacy Index via the REST API].  

This section introduces index creations via a step by step walk through using the classic editor.  The reader should be already familiar with the basic concepts of full-text search 

This example xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc#main[Creating a Legacy Index] provides a simple introduction to using Search, however it is not optimized nor does it expose many useful features that the Search service supports.  
This example only runs on the _default scope/collection (created when migrating bucket data into collections) and should be considered a legacy mode. This example is compatible with the  pre collections bucket based paridigm.

_Note a legacy index can only work on just one keyspace <bucket_name>._default._default._

= Creating a Legacy Index

This section describes creating an Index on a bucket's *_default* scope/collection.  This collection is created when upgrading from Buckets to Collections.

To create a basic Search index on the _default collection, through the Classic Editor:

* Access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

*  Click the *Add Index* link in the upper right of the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.
+

* To define any index on which Full Text Search a unique name for the index in the *Index Name* field, on the upper-left. Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names and the first character of the name must be alphabetic. 
+
Enter *travel-sample-index* as the name of the Search index you are creating in the *Index Name* text-box.
+

* Select the bucket *travel-sample* from the *Bucket* pull-down menu.
+
Use the pull-down menu provided for the Bucket field, on the upper-right, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+

* Save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen.
+
This is all you need to specify in order to create a basic index for test and development. No further configuration is required.

== Test the Legacy Index with a simple query

In the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* Click on the index you just created (named "landmark-content-index") to expand the Index's controls.

* In the text area of the search box enter *+view +food +beach* this will search on all three keywords

* Click on the blue *Search* button. You will get documents from both type hotel and type landmark

NOTE: Creating default indexes as above indexes across all fields is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.
