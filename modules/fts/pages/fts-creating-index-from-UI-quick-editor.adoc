= Creating Index from UI

The user interface for Full Text Search is provided by the Couchbase Web Console. To proceed, you must have permission to log into the console, create indexes, and perform searches. For information on Role-Based Access Control, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

The example provided in this section assumes that you have also loaded the `travel-sample bucket:` you will perform your Full Text Search operations on the data in this bucket. For instructions on how to load this sample bucket, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

Once you have the appropriate credentials and have loaded the `travel-sample bucket`, access the Couchbase Web Console by typing `+http://localhost:8094+` into the address field at the top of your browser and then hitting return.

The login screen appears as follows:

Enter your username and password, and left-click the *Sign In* button. The Couchbase Web Console now appears, with the Dashboard for the cluster displayed:

NOTE: The appearance of the main panel of the Dashboard varies in accordance with customizations that have been performed. For information, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].

To access the Full Text Search screen, left-click on the *Search* tab in the navigation bar on the left-hand side:

image::fts-select-search-tab.png[,100,align=left]

The Full Text Search screen now appears as follows:

image::fts-fts-console-initial.png[,750,align=left]

The console contains areas for displaying indexes and aliases: but both are empty since none has yet been created.

== Quick editor 

Quick Editor is a new interface in FTS where you can quickly select the bucket, scope, and collection and choose the index fields from the searched documents.

Due to this, the search query performance will be optimized as it has to handle fewer fields, increasing the query latency.

To quick edit an index, left-click on the *Quick Edit* button towards the right-hand side on the Full Text Indexes panel.

The Quick Edit screen appears:

image::fts-quick-edit-screen.png[,800,align=left]

Quick Edit allows you to modify and delete the configured mapped fields with the same index. To delete the mapped fields, select the field from the Mapped Fields grid and click Delete.

To map the new fields, select the field from the JSON format document, change the configuration and click Add.

To modify the mapped fields, select the field from the Mapped Fields, change the configuration and click Update.

To save your changes in the quick index, left-click on the *Update Index* button near the bottom of the screen.

== Quick Index

To create a quick index, left-click on the *QUICK INDEX* button, towards the right-hand side:

The QUICK INDEX screen appears:

image::fts-quick-index-screen.png[,750,align=left]

To define a basic index on which Full Text Search can be performed, begin by entering a unique name for the index into the Index Name field, on the upper-left: for example, travel-sample-index. (Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names. Note also that the first character of the name must be an alphabetic character.) Then, use the pull-down menu provided for the Keyspace field, at the upper-right, to specify as follows:

bucket: `travel-sample`

scope: `inventory`

collection: `hotel`

image::fts-quick-index-name-and-bucket.png[,750,align=left]

The user can continue to randomly pick documents until they find a document of their intended type/schema. It is also possible to have multi-schema documents within a collection.

image::fts-quick-index-json.png[,750,align=left]

Select the required field from the document, which is needed to be mapped to this index. Once the field is selected, the configuration panel is displayed on the right.

image::fts-quick-index-json-configuration.png[,750,align=left]

Select the related type of the field from the *Type* dropdown.

Select *Index this field as an identifier* to index the identifier values precisely without any transformation; for this case, language selection is disabled.

After that, select the required language for the chosen field.

Additionally, select from the following configuration options corresponding to the selected language:

* *Include in search results*: Select this option to include the field in the search result.
* *Support highlighting*: Select this option to highlight the matched field. For this option, you must select the *Include in search result* option.
* *Support phrase matching*: Select this option to match the phrases in the index.
* *Support sorting and faceting*: Select this option to allow sorting and faceting the index.

NOTE: Selecting configuration options requires additional storage and makes the index size larger.

== Document Refresh/Reselection option

The 'Refresh' option will randomly select a document from the given Keyspace (bucket.scope.collection).

image::fts-quick-index-refresh.png[,750,align=left]

Include In search results, Support phrase matching, and Support sorting and faceting. Searchable As field allows you to modify searchable input for the selected field.

image::fts-quick-index-searchable-input.png[,750,align=left]

Once the configuration is completed for the selected fields, click Add. Mapped fields will display the updated columns.

image::fts-quick-index-json-mapping.png[,750,align=left]

This is all you need to specify in order to create a basic index for test and development. No further configuration is required. 

Note, however, that such default indexing is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant. To review the wide range of available options for creating indexes appropriate for production environments, see Creating Indexes.

To save your index, 

Left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen:


At this point, you are returned to the Full Text Search screen. A row now appears, in the Full Text Indexes panel, for the quick index you have created. When left-clicked on, the row opens as follows:

image::fts-new-quick-index-progress.png[,900,align=left]

NOTE: The percentage figure appears under the indexing progress column, and is incremented in correspondence with the build-progress of the index. When 100% is reached, the index build is said to be complete. Search queries will, however, be allowed as soon as the index is created, meaning partial results can be expected until the index build is complete. 

Once the new index has been built, it supports Full Text Searches performed by all available means: the Console UI, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase SDK.

NOTE: If one or more of the nodes in the cluster running data service go down and/or are failed over, indexing progress may show a value > 100%.
