= Quick editor 

Quick Editor is a new interface in FTS where you can quickly select the bucket, scope, and collection and choose the index fields from the searched documents.

Due to this, the search query performance will be optimized as it has to handle fewer fields, increasing the query latency.

To quick edit an index left-click on the *Quick Edit* button towards the right-hand side on the Full Text Indexes panel.

The Quick Edit screen appears:

Quick Edit allows you to modify and delete the configured mapped fields with the same index. To delete the mapped fields, select the field from the Mapped Fields grid and click Delete.

To map the new fields, select the field from the JSON format document, change the configuration and click Add.
