== Pagination

The number of results obtained for a Full Text Search request can be large at times. Pagination of these results becomes essential for sorting and displaying a subset of these results.

There are multiple ways to achieve pagination with settings within a search request. Pagination will fetch a deterministic set of results when the results are sorted in a certain fashion.

Pagination provides the following options: 

* xref:fts-pagination-size-from-offset-limit.adoc[size/limit, from/offset]
* xref:fts-pagination-skip-limit.adoc[skip/limit]
* xref:fts-pagination-search-after-search-before.adoc[search_after, search_before]
