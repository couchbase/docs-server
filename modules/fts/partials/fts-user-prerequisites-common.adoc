== Prerequisites

The user interface for Full Text Search is provided by the Couchbase Web Console. To proceed, you must have permission to log into the console, create indexes, and perform searches. For information on Role-Based Access Control, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

The example provided in this section assumes that you have also loaded the `travel-sample bucket:` you will perform your Full Text Search operations on the data in this bucket. For instructions on how to load this sample bucket, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

Once you have the appropriate credentials and have loaded the `travel-sample bucket`, access the Couchbase Web Console by accessing `+http://${CB_HOSTNAME}:8091+` and loging in. 

Note: *CB_HOSTNAME* is an environment variable set to a FQDN, IP address, 127.0.0.1, or localhost for a node on your Couchbase cluster.
