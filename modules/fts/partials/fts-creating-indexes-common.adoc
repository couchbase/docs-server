To quickly familiarize yourself with Search try one of the step by step index creation (and query) examples against the *travel-sample* sample dataset:

* Collections

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-onefield.adoc[Creating a One Field Index] with a simple query example via the UI.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index] with a simple query example via the REST API.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc[Creating a Geopoint Index] with a simple query example via the UI.

* Bucket Compatibility

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc[Creating a Legacy Index] with a simple query example via the UI. 
+
This is used for compatibility after an upgrade from buckets to collections uses the old bucket style "*default _mapping_*.  The preferred method is discussed in xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index] above.

For a more detailed explanation of the available index creation, including index creation by means of the Couchbase REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].
