To quickly familiarize yourself with Search try one of the step by step index creation (and query) examples against the *travel-sample* sample dataset:

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-onefield.adoc[Creating a One Field Index] with a simple query example.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc[Creating a Geopoint Index] with a simple query example.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc[Creating a Legacy Index] with a simple query example. +
(used for compatibility after an upgrade from buckets to collections).

For a more detailed explanation of the available index creation, including index creation by means of the Couchbase REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].
