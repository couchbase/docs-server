To quickly familiarize yourself with Search try one of the step by step index creation (and query) examples against the *travel-sample* sample dataset:

* Collections

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-onefield.adoc[Creating a One Field Index] with a simple query example via the UI.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc[Creating a Geopoint Index] with a simple query example via the UI.

* Bucket Compatibility

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc[Creating a Legacy Index] with a simple query example via the UI. +
(used for compatibility after an upgrade from buckets to collections).

For a more detailed explanation of the available index creation, including index creation by means of the Couchbase REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].

To install the *travel-sample* sample dataset, refer to xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Install Sample Buckets with the UI
