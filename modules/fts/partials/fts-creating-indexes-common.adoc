To quickly become familiarized with the Search service, try one of the step by step index creation (and query) examples against the `travel-sample` sample dataset:

* Collections

** Creating a *One Field Index* xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-onefield.adoc[via the UI] (or xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-onefield.adoc[via the REST API]), followed by a sample Search query.

** Creating a *Dynamic Index* xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[via the UI] (or xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-dynamic.adoc[via the REST API]), followed by a sample Search query.

** Creating a *Geopoint Index* xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc[via the UI] (or xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-geopoint.adoc[via the REST API]), followed by a sample Search query.

* Bucket Compatibility

** Creating a *Legacy Index* xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-legacy.adoc[via the UI] (or xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-legacy.adoc[via the REST API]), followed by a sample Search query.

_The above Legacy Index is used for compatibility after an upgrade from buckets to collections uses the old bucket style "*default _mapping_* which only works on the _default scope and _default collection where buckets are upgraded into.  The preferred method as of version 7.0 is shown in xref:fts-creating-index-from-UI-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index] above._

For a more detailed explanation of the available index creation, including index creation by means of the Couchbase REST API, refer to xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].
