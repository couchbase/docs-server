* Click the *Add Index* link in the upper right of the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page.

* To define any index on which Full Text Search a unique name for the index in the *Index Name* field, on the upper-left. Note that only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores are allowed for index names and the first character of the name must be alphabetic. 
+
Enter *test_geopoint* as the name of the Search index you are creating in the *Index Name* text-box.

* Select the bucket *travel-sample* from the *Bucket* pull-down menu.
+
Use the pull-down menu provided for the Bucket field, on the upper-right, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+
image::fts-index-name-and-bucket-geopoint.png[,450,align=left]

* Select the checkbox *[X] Use non-default scope/collections* 
+
This allows your index to stream mutations from one or more non-default collections under the selected bucket and scope.
+

* You will see a newly visible pull-down menu provided for the *Scope* field, under the *[X] Use non-default scope/collections* checkbox, and select a bucket that you are allowed to access to via the cluster's RBAC settings.
+
For this example leave the setting as *_default* which which is used to migrate bucket based data into the collections paradigm. 

* Under *Type Mapings*, unselect the checkbox *[ ]  default | dynamic*.
+
This is required as this type mapping (the default mapping) is only valid for the <bucket>._default._default which is typically used to upgrade a 6.X server from a bucket into a more powerful collections paradigm.  In this example we will do the equivlent but on a per collections basis.

* Click on the button *+ Add Type Mapping*

** A new section with a *Collection* pull-down, *Analyzer* pull-down and a *[ ] only index specified fields* checkbox will appear.
+

** Select *_default* from the *Collection* pull-down, note the pull down will change to a text field prefilled with *_default._default*
+
image::fts-index-menu1-geopoint-filled.png[,600,align=left]

** Leave the *[{nbsp}{nbsp}] only index specified fields* checkbox blank or unset.
+
This will index all fields in the scope *_default* collection *_default*, howver not this is not recommended for large production datasets.

** Click on the blue *ok* at the right of the section to save this mapping.

** Hover over your newly created/saved row 

** Click on the blue *+* button the right side of the row.
+

** A context menu of "insert child mapping" (for sub-objects) and "insert child field" (for properties) will appear.
+
image::fts-index-menu2-geopoint-empty.png[,600,align=left]

** Select *insert child field*

** another row menu will appear with the following controls: "field", "type", "text", "searchable as", "analyzer" "inherit", "index", "store", "include in _all field", "include term vectors", and "docvalues".
+
image::fts-index-menu2-geopoint-filled.png[,600,align=left]

** Set the text box *field* to *geo*, this will also update "searchable as" to *geo*.

** Change the pull-down *type* to *geopoint*.
+
By configuring the child field information form, specifically identify the object *geo* as type *geopoint* this will tell the Search indexer to recongnize top level sub-objects like:
+
[source, json]
----
  "geo": {
    "lat": 53.48253,
    "lon": -2.23527,
    "accuracy": "ROOFTOP"
  },
----

** Check *[X]* the boxes "store" and "include in _all field"

** Click on the blue *ok* at the right of the section to save this sub-form.
+ 
image::fts-index-menu2-geopoint-filled.png[,600,align=left]

* Save your index, left-click on the *Create Index* button near the bottom of the screen.
+
This is all you need to specify in order to create a more advanced index for test and development. No further configuration is required.

* If you subsequently Edit your Index it should look like the following:

NOTE: Indexing all fields as above indexes across all fields is not recommended for production environments since it creates indexes that may be unnecessarily large, and therefore insufficiently performant.
However this index can be edited and optimized if you check *[X] only index specified fields* under the Type Mappings section. 
This will result in a much smaller index and a faster index build since only the field *geo* will be indexed in the set of documents.
