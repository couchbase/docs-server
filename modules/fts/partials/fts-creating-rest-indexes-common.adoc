To quickly familiarize yourself with Search try one of index creation (and query) examples against the *travel-sample* sample dataset:

* Collections

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-classic-editor-onefield.adoc[Creating a One Field Index] with a simple query example via the REST API.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index] with a simple query example via the REST API.

** xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-classic-editor-geopoint.adoc[Creating a Geopoint Index] with a simple query example via the REST API.

* Bucket Compatibility 

** Although old index creation scripts that use the old bucket style "*default _mapping_*. from versions prior to 7.0 will work. 
The preferred method is discussed in xref:fts-creating-index-from-REST-classic-editor-dynamic.adoc[Creating a Dynamic Index] above.

For a more detailed explanation of the available index creation, including index creation by means of the Couchbase UI, refer to xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Search Indexes].

To install the *travel-sample* sample dataset, refer to xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api[Install Sample Buckets with the REST API
].
