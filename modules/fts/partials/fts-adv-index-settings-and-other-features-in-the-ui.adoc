= Advanced Index Settings and Other Features in the UI

The complete range of available options for creating  Search indexes for any production environment is covered here: xref:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].

Once you hit the  *Create Index* button you will return to the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page (note, if you tested any index just access the *Couchbase Web Console* > *Search* page again).

At this point, you are returned to the Full Text Search screen. 

A new row now appears for the index you have just created. When left-clicked on, the row opens or expands as follows:

== Index Build Progress

Once the new index has been built, it supports Full Text Searches performed by all available means: the Console UI, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase SDK.

=== Statistic: docs processed

The percentage figure appears under the indexing progress column and represents the number of documents present in the index.  

* On an initial build this may take a while to process all the documents.  

* A mutation to an existing document will not increment this count (unless new items are added).

=== Statistic: indexing progress

The percentage figure appears under the indexing progress column and is incremented in correspondence with the build-progress of the index. When 100% is reached, the index build is complete. 

* However, search queries will be allowed as soon as the index is created, meaning partial results can be expected until the index build is complete.  

* If later mutations com in the percentage may actually jump around as batches of documents are processed.

* If one or more of the nodes in the cluster running data service goes down and/or are failed over, indexing progress may show a value > 100%.  

[#using-the-show-index-definition]
== Show Index Definition 

This expandable section shows the JSON document that describes the current index configuration, as created by means of the user interface.  

A checkbox *[{nbsp}{nbsp}] Show curl command to modify this index definition* is set will wrap the index definition with a command line cURL syntax.  

You can copy either variant (the cURL mode) and the definitions can be used via the Search REST API or any Couchbase SDK.

[#using-the-index-definition-preview]
== Using the Index Definition Preview

The _Index Definition Preview_ appears to the right-hand side of the *Add Index* (or an *Edit Index*) screen.

Following index-definition, the upper portion may appear as follows:

[#fts_index_definition_preview]
image::fts-index-definition-preview.png[,,align=left]

This preview (like the *Show Index Definition JSON* from the main Search page) consists of the JSON document that describes the current index configuration, as created by means of the user interface.
By left-clicking on the [.ui]*copy to clipboard* tab, the definition can be saved.   

These definitions can be used via the Search REST API or any Couchbase SDK.
