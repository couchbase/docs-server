= Performance and Consistency

[abstract]
GSIs are designed to provide low latency scans for the query service.
There are many things that can be done to improve the performance of GSIs.
Sometimes, however, you may wish to compromise on performance in order to achieve better consistency for your queries.

[#section_szd_j1z_zz]
== Index Performance

GSIs provide a lower latency scan compared to view indexes due to its architecture.
GSI, as its name suggests is a global index that is independently placed within the cluster as opposed to Views, which are local indexes placed aligned to the data distribution.

.Query Execution with Global Indexes
[#fig_jzj_ms1_vv]

Global secondary indexes can be placed on a single node.
However as the number of index scans, mutations, the total items indexed, and the total index size increases, it will be necessary to scale the index.
You can scale the index in 2 ways:

[#ul_tzd_j1z_zz]
* Load balancing with GSI.
You can create replicas of the same index to allow scans to be routed to multiple nodes.
* Partitioning with GSI.
You can split the index into multiple partitions, to distribute indexed items, index scan requests, and limit the mutations and size the single index has to handle.

In either approach, you also need to scale the index service to allocate more computational resources to indexes.

Load Balancing with GSI::
It is possible to create indexes with replicas distributed amongst multiple nodes.
Unlike replicas used in the data service, each replica index is considered to be equivalent to the active index.
This means that the query service automatically load balances between the replica indexes, even when using the [.api]`USE INDEX` statement or prepared statements.

See xref:index-replication.adoc[Index Replication and High Availability] for further details on index replication.

Partitioning with GSI::
Some of your indexes may no longer fit a single node as the number of mutations, index size, and item count increases.
You can partition a single index using a [.api]`WHERE` clause with [.api]`CREATE INDEX` and by placing partitions across multiple index service nodes under different index names.
+
To load-balance GSIs, you must manually specify the nodes on which index partitions should be built on.
+
You can also create indexes by partitioning your indexes as shown in the following example using ranges:
+
----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
       WHERE type="product" AND productName BETWEEN "A" AND "K" USING GSI
       WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091"]};

CREATE INDEX productName_index2 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
       WHERE type="product" AND productName BETWEEN "K" AND "Z" USING GSI
       WITH {"nodes":["node2:8091"]};
----

Scaling the Index Service::
Couchbase Server scales indexes independent of data and queries.
With multidimensional scaling, you can allocate separate hardware resources for separate services, and avoid resource contention by performing queries, maintaining indexes, and writing data to different nodes.
If your application needs more indexing resources, you can either scale out your infrastructure to add more index nodes, or scale up the index services to handle more workload.

== Query and Index Consistency

In Couchbase Server, mutations to data in the data service is done with full consistency.
All mutations to a given key are done using the same vBucket on a node and are immediately available to anyone reading the latest value for the given key.
However, indexes are maintained in an eventually consistent manner.
This is true for all indexers (GSI, View, and Spatial).
At query time, you can specify a query consistency flag for each N1QL query request, similar to the view API.
The query consistency flag can be one of the following:

[#ul_vzd_j1z_zz]
* [.param]`Not_bounded`: This scan consistency flag executes the query immediately without requiring any consistency for the query.
If the index maintenance is running behind, query may return out-of-date results.
`Not_bounded` scan consistency has the same characteristics as `stale=ok` in the view API.
* [.param]`At_plus`: This scan consistency flag executes the query but require the indexes to be updated to the logical timestamp of the last update performed by the application.
For example, an application issuing the query may have done its last update 10 ms ago.
The sequence number of the update is retrieved from the mutation response and is passed to the query request.
This behavior achieves consistency, at least or later than the moment of the most recent mutation from the application.
If the index maintenance is running behind, the query waits for the index to catch up to the last update.
// At_plus scan consistency flag is not yet implemented by the
// View API.
* [.param]`Request_plus`: This `scan_consistency` flag executes the query but require the indexes to be updated to the logical timestamp of the query request.
For example, an application issuing the query may have done its last update 10 ms ago.
An application issuing the query with `request_plus` scan consistency flag takes the logical timestamp of the query request.
This behavior achieves consistency, at least or later than the moment of the request timestamp.
If the index maintenance is running behind the request timestamp, the query waits for the index to catch up to the request timestamp, this can cause a delay in response to the query.
`Request_plus` scan consistency value has the same characteristics as `stale=false` in the view API.

For N1QL, the default consistency setting is `not_bounded`.
