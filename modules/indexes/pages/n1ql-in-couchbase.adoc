= N1QL in Couchbase

[abstract]
N1QL provides a SQL like query language for Couchbase.
Unlike views, N1QL does not require a dedicated index.
You can use N1QL to issue ad hoc queries on data.

If you are using N1QL in your application and querying data using a variety of different attributes, you need fast query lookups and scans at a high throughput.
Indexes boost N1QL query look ups and scans.
These indexes have different architectures which are based on view indexes, or global secondary indexes (GSI).
