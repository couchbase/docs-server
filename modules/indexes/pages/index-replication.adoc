= Index Replication and High Availability

[abstract]
To provide the same level of high availability as the Data Service, GSIs also support automatic replication between nodes.
These index replicas can then also be used to provide automatic load balancing for incoming N1QL queries.

[#section_tnn_hbz_zz]
== Index Replication and High Availability with N1QL

Individual GSIs can be automatically replicated to other nodes in the cluster to achieve high availability, ensuring that an index continues to function even if a node hosting the index is unavailable.
Queries will load balance across the indexes and if one of the indexes become unavailable, all requests are automatically rerouted to the available remaining index without application or admin intervention.

Replica indexes can be created in three different ways, each using the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createindex.adoc#concept_npk_mth_rq[CREATE INDEX] statement.
The first of these is to specify the nodes which the index should be located in the WITH clause.
The following example creates an index with two replicas, one on `node2` and one on `node3`, with the active on `node1`.

----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
       WHERE type="product" USING GSI
       WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091", "node2:8091", "node3:8091"]};
----

It is also possible to create an index with replicas without specifying which nodes the index should reside on.
Adding [.var]`num_replica` to the WITH clause creates an index with the specified number of replicas, distributed across index nodes in the cluster.
When creating an index with replicas in this manner, the indexer will attempt to distribute the replicas based on the server groups in use in the cluster where possible.
This means that should an entire server group go down, a replica of the index should still be available on one (or more) of the nodes in another (or multiple) server group(s).

The following example creates an index with two replicas without explicitly specifying which nodes they should reside on:

----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
       WHERE type="product" USING GSI
       WITH {"num_replica": 2};
----

If both [.var]`nodes` and [.var]`num_replica` are specified in the WITH clause, then the number of nodes specified must be one greater than [.var]`num_replica`.

Finally, it is possible to create GSIs with replicas without explicitly stating the number of replicas in the [.api]`CREATE INDEX` statement.
This is done by altering the number of replicas that the indexer will create, which defaults to 0.
Changing the default number of replicas can be done using the following curl command and must be done by a full administrator:

----
curl -u <username>:<password> <host>:9102/settings -d "{\"indexer.settings.num_replica\": <num_replicas>}"
----

If manually specifying the number of replicas to create for a given index in the [.api]`CREATE INDEX` statement, then this takes precedence over the default number of replicas from the indexer.

IMPORTANT: When using any of the three above methods, you must ensure that the number of replicas being created is less than the number of index nodes in your cluster, otherwise the index creation will fail.
Once an index has been created with a given number of replicas, if the number of index nodes in a cluster goes below the number of nodes required then new replicas will be created on any incoming index nodes, until the desired number of replicas exist for a given index.

Once an index with replicas has been created, you will be able to see each of its replicas (and active) as individual entries in the 'Index' tab in the web console.
However, as the replicas are opaque to the query service, you will not see these replicas in `system:indexes`.
