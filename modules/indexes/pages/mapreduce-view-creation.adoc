= View creation

[abstract]
You can create a simple view by defining a JavaScript map function that generates output data, which represents a mapping of the documents stored within the bucket.

For example, here is a simple map function written in JavaScript that returns the [.param]`document id` and the name [.param]`attribute`.

----
function map( doc, meta )
    {
    if(doc.name != null)
    {
    emit( meta.id, doc.name );
    }
    }
----

When you run a query using the view, the emit function generates a list of key-value pairs.
The key helps you identify the specific document and the value provides the details you are looking for.
Optionally, you can use a reduce function to aggregate the values produced by the map output into a single value (or a single value for each group).
With Couchbase Server, you can choose to use a built-in reduce function (such as `_sum`, `_count`, and `_stats`) or write your own custom reduce function.
