= Developer Preview

[abstract]
The _Developer Preview_, available with Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5 Beta, allows developers to experiment with early versions of forthcoming Couchbase technology.

[#Collections]
== The Developer Preview includes _Collections_.
These are data containers that can be created any bucket whose type is either _Couchbase_ or _Ephemeral_.
This allows data-items optionally to be assigned to different collections according to content-type.

For the Developer Preview, collections can be managed by either the _REST API_ or the _CLI_.
For more information, see xref:developer-preview/collections/collections-overview.adoc[Collections Overview].
