[abstract]
Provides information on collections.

== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] collections
----

== Description

This command is used to collect information on collections.

== Options

There are no options specific to this command.
For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cbstats-intro.adoc[[.cmd]`cbstats`].

== Examples

The following command retrieves collections-related information on an existing bucket named `testBucket`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 collections
----

The output is as follows:

----
collection:0x0:items:         2
collection:0x8:items:         0
collection:0x9:items:         0
collection:0xa:items:         0
manifest:collection:0x0:name: _default
manifest:collection:0x8:name: my_collection_in_my_scope_1
manifest:collection:0x9:name: my_collection_in_my_scope_2
manifest:collection:0xa:name: my_collection_in_default_scope
manifest:collections:         4
manifest:default_exists:      true
manifest:uid:                 4
----

Note that the output identifies the _default collection as 0x0, and indicates that this contains `2` items.
The output also indicates that three additional scopes exist, which are `my_collection_in_my_scope_1`, `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`, and `my_collection_in_default_scope`.
