Provides information on collections.

== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] scopes
----

== Description

This command is used to collect information on scopes.

== Options

There are no options specific to this command.
For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

== Examples

The following command retrieves scopes-related information on an existing bucket named `testBucket`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 scopes
----

The output is as follows:

----
manifest:scopes:                 2
manifest:scopes:0x0:collections: 2
manifest:scopes:0x0:name:        _default
manifest:scopes:0x8:collections: 2
manifest:scopes:0x8:name:        my_scope
manifest:uid:                    4
----

The output identifies the `_default` scope as `0x0`, and indicates that this contains `2` collections.
The output also indicates that one additional scope exists, which is `my_scope`, identified as `0x8`, and specified also to contain `2` collections.
