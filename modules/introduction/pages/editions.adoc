= Couchbase Server Editions

[abstract]
Couchbase Server is available in several editions: enterprise, community, and open source.

Each edition offers different features and levels of support.
For more information on each feature, see the <<ee-vs-ce,Enterprise and community edition feature matrix>>.

Enterprise Edition::
The Enterprise edition (EE) represents the latest, most stable, production-ready release of Couchbase Server.
We recommend the enterprise edition binaries for commercial production systems running Couchbase Server.
The enterprise edition contains some unique features that make it the best fit for production deployments running in data centers or a public cloud infrastructure.
These features, which are not available in the community edition, are listed in the <<ee-vs-ce>>.
Use of EE in development and test environments is free.
EE requires a paid subscription for production use.
Our http://www.couchbase.com/subscriptions-and-support[paid annual subscriptions^] for EE include a commercial license, better availability capabilities, enhanced security features, advanced tooling and higher performance and scale.
It also includes technical support with service level commitments via our 24x7 support organization and hot fixes for releases.
One important principle for CE and EE is to ensure full portability of applications between two editions.
The capabilities ensure that an application running on EE should simply transition to CE without code changes and visa versa.

Community Edition::
The Community Edition (CE) is best for noncommercial developers where basic availability, performance, scale, tooling, security capabilities and community support is sufficient.
CE comes free and there are no constraints on using these binaries in production systems.
However, CE is not subjected to the iterative "test, fix, and verify" quality assurance cycle that is a part of the enterprise edition release process.
The release version of CE is several months behind EE.
CE also do not include the latest bug fixes.
Documentation, mailing lists, and forums provide support for the Couchbase user community to help troubleshoot issues and answer questions.

Open source project::
The Couchbase Server open source project is a platform for innovation.
Couchbase is committed to open source development and the open source project continues to serve as the foundation for both the community edition and the enterprise edition.
There are many ways to contribute to the open source project: You can contribute code to our core engine, to our SDKs, connectors and other integration components that help us connect to other products through https://github.com/couchbase[github.com/couchbase^], you can report issues on our tracking system: https://issues.couchbase.com/projects/MB?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page[JIRA^] and contribute to documentation either through http://github.com/couchbase/docs-cb4[github.com/couchbase/docs-cb4^] or by simply clicking the "Feedback" link in our online documentation.
The full details on contributing to open source can be found on the open source page http://developer.couchbase.com/open-source-projects[developer.couchbase.com/open-source-projects^].

[[auto-failover]]Auto Failover::
The smart cluster manager built into Couchbase Server detects and recovers from node failures using auto-failover.
Manual and auto-failover between Couchbase Server nodes is included in both Enterprise and Community Edition.

[[online-rebalance]]Online Rebalance::
Online rebalance redistributes the load across nodes as Couchbase Server cluster expands and shrinks by adding and removing nodes.
The ability to add or remove nodes and rebalance the cluster data distribution among Couchbase Server nodes is included in both Enterprise and Community Edition.

[[xdcr]]Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)::
Globally distributed applications use XDCR to replicate their Couchbase Server data across multiple data-centers.
The ability to replicate data across data centers, between multiple Couchbase Server clusters, is included in both Enterprise and Community Edition.

[[filtering-replication-xdcr]]Filtering Replication with Cross Data-Center Replication::
Interactive applications use XDCR to improve data locality by deploying data closer to the users geographies.
With XDCR, customers in Asia vs customers in US can have local copies of the relevant data in their regional data centers.
XDCR with Filtering ensures only the relevant data is carried between clusters across the wide area network (WAN).
This improves replication efficiency and saves bandwidth.
The ability to replicate data selectively with XDCR Filtering between multiple Couchbase Server clusters is only included in the Enterprise Edition.

[[rack-zone-awareness]]Rack/Availability Zone Awareness::
Administrators can use Rack and Zone Awareness (server groups) in a Couchbase Server deployment to ensure smart placements of replicas across racks and availability zones.
Rack and Zone Awareness with Couchbase Server places replicas smartly to protect against rack or availability-zone failures in public or private cloud deployment.
This protection is only available in the Enterprise Edition.
