= What's New?

Couchbase Server 5.5 is a substantial extension of the Couchbase Data Platform.
This release introduces several new enterprise grade features relating to agility, performance, and manageability.
It also includes enhancements to existing services as well as new server and SDK components that have been in the works for a long time.
Take a look at the xref:release-notes:relnotes.adoc[release notes] for a list of known and fixed issues in this release.

== Unmatched agility and flexibility

*Couchbase Eventing Service*

This release introduces our Couchbase Eventing Service – a multidimensional-scaling (MDS) enabled service that lets you process changes to data as they happen in near real-time.

Couchbase Functions is the first offering under the Couchbase Eventing Service that enables you to write server-side functions that are automatically triggered using the familiar Event-Condition-Action model.
It provides an easy-to-use online JavaScript code editor that lets you develop and debug the code on generated mutations to the data residing in Couchbase cluster.

The Couchbase Eventing Service handles all the complexity of scaling to a large number of document mutations.
This new offering enables you to develop deeply engaging and personalized user experiences based on real-time events.
To learn more about this new service, see xref:eventing:eventing-overview.adoc[Introduction].

*Couchbase Analytics (Developer Preview)*

Couchbase Analytics (currently in Developer Preview) enables you to analyze your JSON data in real time without the need to extract, transform, load (ETL) your data into a separate system.
It allows you to develop insight-driven applications quickly and easily using the same SDKs.
It removes the need for ETL and the complexity of managing a separate analytics system.
With this release, Analytics is fully integrated with Couchbase Server and no longer requires a separate installation.
Couchbase’s unique architecture for Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) allows operational and analytical queries to run concurrently without impacting one another, providing the workload isolation required for production deployments.
To learn more about this service, see xref:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics].

*ANSI joins in N1QL*

The Couchbase Data Platform is the only platform that extends SQL to support JSON data natively via N1QL queries.
N1QL now has support for ANSI joins making it easier to migrate applications from RDBMS to Couchbase.
Developers can leverage their SQL knowledge to develop applications on Couchbase, thereby increasing productivity.

ANSI joins support improved data modeling capability and flexibility with Couchbase.
Since you can join based on arbitrarily complex expressions, business requirements can be coded and translated effectively and efficiently.
We've extended ANSI syntax to join on both scalars and arrays.
See the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ek1_jnx_1db[ANSI JOIN Clause] for details.

== Unparalleled performance at scale

*N1QL pushdowns - aggregate optimization*

One of the key advantages of a declarative query language like N1QL is that the system can optimize and improve the query plans and execution without changing the applications.
Since the introduction of N1QL, Couchbase has improved the query performance by orders of magnitude.

With aggregate optimization, the query engine leverages the indexes to perform aggregate calculations to improve the performance of queries by another order of magnitude.
Your existing aggregate queries with matching indexes will simply run faster.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/groupby-aggregate-performance.adoc[Group By and Aggregate Performance] for details.

*Index partitioning*

With support for index partitioning, you can now index a large number of documents and horizontally scale an index as needed.
The system will partition the index across a number of index nodes using hash partitioning.

Index partitioning is transparent to queries – one does not have to update the queries when changing the index partitioning strategy.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index-partitioning.adoc[Index Partitioning] for details.

*End-to-end data compression*

With the introduction of compression across layers from client to storage, Couchbase significantly reduces the cost of network, memory, and storage required for your existing workloads.

Documents are transparently compressed when transferred between the clients and the servers, in the server cache, and on disk.
Documents are also compressed when transferred between clusters across data centers.
See xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/compression.adoc[Compression] for more information.

*New Full-Text Search index engine (Developer Preview)*

The latest update to the full-text search service provides a preview of our new indexing engine, codename: scorch.
If you want to test the new performance, you can choose to use the current engine (version 5.0) or try the new engine (version 6.0) when creating an index through the GUI or REST API.

The indexing speed is substantially faster, up to 2x faster, and the index size on disk has been dramatically reduced, up to 80% reduction.
Note that these are interim performance numbers as development continues.

This release of Full-text Search also includes 11 new language analyzers including: Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish (Castilian), Swedish, and Turkish.

== Ease of platform management

*Security compliance*

Couchbase continues to extend its support for security to enable enterprises to meet increasing security compliance requirements such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective May 2018.
We extend xref:security:security-certs-auth.adoc[X.509 certificate authentication] beyond key-value data access to query and search services for xref:dotnet-sdk::sdk-authentication-overview.adoc[all SDK].

We also support xref:java-sdk::common/encryption.adoc[field-level encryption] in our SDKs to protect sensitive user data.
Users can xref:clustersetup:logging.adoc#understanding_redaction[enable log redaction] to prevent leaking sensitive user data when using the logs for troubleshooting production issues.

Furthermore, we employ system auditing to track all admin and non-admin access, including xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/n1ql-auditing.adoc[auditing of query statements].

// <p><b>Deploying and managing Couchbase at scale with Kubernetes</b></p>
// <p>An open source system for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications,
// Kubernetes handles the work of scheduling containers onto a cluster and manages the
// workloads to ensure they run as the user intended.
// By leveraging the latest features from
// Kubernetes to support stateful applications, we allow users to leverage their investment in
// Kubernetes and containers to easily deploy and manage Couchbase clusters at scale.
// In
// addition, a close partnership with Red Hat is bringing all of this capability to OpenShift.
// See the <xref
// href="http://docs.couchbase.com/prerelease/couchbase-operator/beta/overview.html"
// format="html" scope="external">Couchbase Operator User's Guide</xref> for more
// information.</p>

*Auto failover*

Couchbase further improves high availability for mission-critical deployments and reduce operator intervention.
Couchbase enhances the detection of common disk failures and automatically fails over the node with bad disks saving without operator intervention.
It also handles multiple server failures based on the replica count to avoid data loss, and can fail over an entire server group if a rack or zone is not available.

*Response Time Observability*

With response time observability, you now have telemetry for monitoring how well your Couchbase cluster is meeting your application SLAs.
In your application you can set thresholds to allow you to log operations based on performance of your requests.
You can correlate timing information from client through to server and back to quickly triage performance issues and help identify the root cause of performance issues.

The performance of operations are all exposed via methods you are already familiar with in the Couchbase SDK.
See xref:dotnet-sdk::threshold-logging.adoc[Threshold Logging Tracing through the SDK] for details.

*IPv6 support*

With the explosion of mobile and IoT devices, enterprises are seeing an increasing percentage of their user traffic coming from IPv6.
Many large enterprises are starting to deploy IPv6 infrastructure to support these IPv6 devices.
We have added IPv6 support to enable our customers to deliver exceptional user experiences with the Couchbase Data Platform.
See xref:install:ipv6-setup.adoc[Using IPv6 With Couchbase] for more information.

*SDK enhancements*

Many improvements are exposed through the Couchbase SDK, therefore update to the latest versions to ensure maximum compatibility.
See the xref:java-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc[SDK documentation] for details.
