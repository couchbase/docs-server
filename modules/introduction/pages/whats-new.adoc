*Flexible way to Extract Identity from Client Certificates*

While release 4.5 added the ability to use client certificates, it required the identity to be encoded in a particular way.
However, the identity in client certificates can be encoded in different ways for different kinds of users.
This release (version 5.1) adds a flexible scheme to extract the identity from client certificates.
See xref:security:security-certs-auth.adoc[Certificate-Based Authentication] for details.

[#tools]
== Tools

The [.cmd]`cbbackupmgr` utility stores and restores the bucket configuration along with the backed-up data.
If your bucket configuration settings have been updated since your last backup, then restoring a previous backup will overwrite these settings by default.
Now you can choose to not restore the bucket configuration by setting the "`--disable-bucket-config`" flag.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr] for details.

[#platforms]
== Supported Platforms

Support for Debian 9 has been added.
