== New Features and Enhancements

This section describes the new features and enhancements in this release.
See also xref:introduction:whats-new.adoc#features-added-in-712[Features Added in 7.1.2], below.

=== Analytics Service: High Availability

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, Analytics Service data was not replicated.
This meant that when an Analytics node failed over, the Analytics Service stopped working cluster-wide.
If the failed-over Analytics node was then recovered, data ingestion had to begin again from scratch.

Analytics shadow data may now be replicated up to 3 times.
When replicas exist, and an Analytics node fails over, the Analytics Service continues to work: one of the replicas is promoted to serve the shadow data stored on the failed over node.
If the failed-over Analytics node is then recovered, the shadow data on the recovered node is updated from the promoted replica.

Analytics replicas can be managed using the user interface, the `setting-analytics` command line tool, or the Analytics Settings REST API.
For further details, refer to xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General Settings].

Analytics replicas can also be monitored using the Analytics Cluster Status REST API.
Refer to xref:analytics:rest-admin.adoc#cluster-status[Cluster Status].

=== Analytics Service: Analytics Views and Tabular Analytics Views

Analytics now supports _Analytics views_, which are virtual Analytics collections derived from actual stored Analytics collections.
Analytics views might be used to present a subset of the stored data, or to present a join or other transformation of stored data for some particular purpose.
Queries may operate on Analytics views in exactly the same way as they do on real stored data.

Analytics also supports _tabular Analytics views_, a type of view that presents data in the form of a table with uniform rows and columns and with a well-defined schema.
Tabular views enable Analytics to interact with software tools that are designed for relational databases, such as https://www.tableau.com[Tableau^].

For further details on Analytics views and tabular Analytics views, refer to xref:analytics:5a_views.adoc[].

=== Tableau Connector

The new Tableau Connector provides integration between Couchbase Analytics tabular views and the Tableau interactive data visualization platform.
Refer to xref:tableau-connector::index.adoc[].

=== Analytics Service: External Datasets on Azure Blob Storage

The Analytics Service now supports external datasets on Azure Blob storage.
These may be managed using the UI or the Analytics Links REST API.
Refer to xref:analytics:manage-links.adoc[] and xref:analytics:rest-links.adoc[].

=== Analytics Service: Array Indexes

Analytics now provides _array indexes_, which enable you to index values within an array, or fields within an object nested in an array.
In Analytics, array indexes are not meant to serve as covering indexes.
Instead, array indexes are simply meant to accelerate queries involving multi-valued fields.
For further details, refer to xref:analytics:7_using_index.adoc[].

The data definition language has been extended to support the creating and dropping of array indexes.
Refer to xref:analytics:5_ddl.adoc[].

=== Query Service: Join Enumeration

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, the cost-based optimizer was unable to rewrite queries to use the optimal join order.
Joins were performed in the order in which they are specified in the query, and no reordering of joins was considered.

The cost-based optimizer may now consider different join orders, and can choose the optimal join order based on cost information.
This is the default behavior when the cost-based optimizer is active and the optimizer statistics are up-to-date.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/cost-based-optimizer.adoc[].

You can use an optimizer hint, if required, to over-ride the cost-based optimizer and specify that the query should use the join order as written.
Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/query-hints.adoc[].

=== Query Service: Optimizer Hints

You can now include optimizer hints within queries to supply directives to the optimizer.
Optimizer hints request that the optimizer should consider specific indexes, join methods, join ordering, and so on, when creating the plan for a query.
This may be useful in situations where the optimizer is not able to come up with the preferred plan, due to lack of optimizer statistics, high level of skew in data, data correlations, and so on.

You can supply hints to the operator within a specially-formatted hint comment, similar to the type of hint comment found in many relational databases.
Many optimizer hints have legacy equivalents using the USE clause.
For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/optimizer-hints.adoc[].

=== Multiple Root Certificates

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, a Couchbase-Server cluster could maintain at most _one_ root certificate: all nodes and all clients were obliged to rely on this certificate's authority.
From version 7.1, Couchbase Server permits multiple root certificates to be maintained in a _trust store_ for the cluster.
This allows an individual node either to use a CA that is also used by one or more other nodes; or to use a CA that is used by no other node.
This procedure may be used during CA certificate rotation: a new CA is uploaded, node certificates are changed one by one, and finally, the old CA is removed.

Couchbase Server additionally uses its list of trusted certificates to verify:

* Client certificates (when client certificate authentication is enabled).

* The identities of cluster nodes (when node-to-node encryption is enabled).

* The identities of nodes that join the cluster (when the server has been provisioned with certificates).

* The identity of LDAP servers (when TLS has been turned on, in the LDAP settings).

For more information, see xref:learn:security/using-multiple-cas.adoc[Using Multiple Root Certificates].

Note that prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, node-to-node encryption, which is managed by means of the Couchbase CLI, needed to be _disabled_ before management of either _root_ or _intermediate_ certificates could be performed.
This restriction is lifted in version 7.1: therefore, root and intermediate certificates _can_ now be managed while node-to-node encryption is enabled.

=== Eventing Service: Full Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) support

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, running Functions under the Eventing Service required admin permissions of either "Full Admin" or "Full Eventing Admin".

This limiting restriction is lifted in version 7.1.  Now any user can securely create or manage Eventing Functions provided they have proper RBAC permissions configured.

=== Encrypted Private Keys

Use of encrypted private keys is now supported for certificate management.

In version 7.1, Couchbase Server supports _PKCS #1_ and _PKCS #8_ &#8212; in each case, only for use with private keys:

* _PKCS #1_ can be used for _unencrypted_ private keys only.

* _PKCS #8_ can be used for both _unencrypted_ and _encrypted_ private keys: note that the user-specified `EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo` must use _PKCS #5 v2_ algorithms.

If a node-certificate to be loaded is associated with an encrypted private key, a procedure can be defined to allow Couchbase Server to access and use the keyâ€™s passphrase, when use of the key is required: the passphrase can be registered by means of a JSON object.
For information, see xref:rest-api:upload-retrieve-node-cert.adoc#json-passphrase-registration[JSON Passphrase Registration].

=== System Events

_System events_ are generated to record significant occurrences on the cluster.
Events are provided for the Cluster Manager, the Data Service, the Index Service, the Search Service, the Eventing Service, the Backup Service, and the Analytics Service.
Events are also generated for XDCR, security, and Views.

Each event is provided as a JSON document containing a number of key-value pairs: some key-value pairs are included in all system events, others are specific to the service for which the event is generated.
Each key-value pair provides definitive information on the event.

For detailed information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/system-events.adoc[System Events].

=== Sync Gateway Roles

New roles are provided for the administration of _Sync Gateway_, especially in the context of Couchbase Capella.
These roles are listed at xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

=== TLS

TLS 1.3 cipher-suites can now be used by all services; and by the Cluster Manager, XDCR, and Views.
For information, see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc#tls-3-cipher-suite-limitations[On the Wire Security].

=== XDCR

XDCR checkpointing is now entirely persistent through topology-changes on the source cluster.
This provides improved performance when failover and rebalance occur on the source cluster.

=== ARM Support

Amazon Linux is now supported on the ARM platform.
See xref:release-notes:relnotes.adoc[] and xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[].

=== Magma Storage Engine
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

The new Magma Storage Engine has been added to 7.1 as an Enterprise Edition feature, allowing for higher performance with very large datasets.
Magma is a disk-based engine, so is highly suited to datasets that will not fit in available memory.
You can find more details on Magma in xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage-engines.adoc[].

=== Plasma Storage Engine

The Plasma Storage Engine has been enhanced, with _per page Bloom filters_ and _in-memory compression_.
For information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#plasma-memory-enhancements[Plasma Memory Enhancements].

=== Improved Auto-Failover

Automatic Failover can now fail several nodes over concurrently; additionally, automatic failover of index services is supported.
Improvements have also been made to rebalancing algorithms, so that active buckets, services, and replicas will be spread across different server groups, even when server groups are unequal.

See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[] and xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[].


=== Improvements to JavaScript User-Defined Functions

//TODO: Add links to the documents when they're merged.

Scope Hierarchy Support::
The JavaScript libraries can now be stored within collection scopes, allowing access to be restricted to users with the necessary security permissions.
For more information, see the section on xref:javascript-udfs:javascript-functions-with-couchbase.adoc#libraries-and-scopes[libraries and scopes] in xref:javascript-udfs:javascript-functions-with-couchbase.adoc[].

N1QL Support::
JavaScript functions can run N1QL statements using either a function call (`N1QL(â€¦)`) or by embedding the N1QL statement directly in the JavaScript code.
See xref:javascript-udfs:calling-n1ql-from-javascript.adoc[] for more information.

UI Support::
Javascript libraries and functions can now be added through the Query tool in the administration console.
For more details, see the xref:tools:udfs-ui.adoc[] page.

=== Improvements to Full-Text Search

A number of improvements have been made to Full-Text Search:

Croatian Language Support::
The FTS engine now supports the Croatian language for search-term input.

Improved Search in the UI::
The FTS UI will now accept complex full text search terms as well as basic search strings.

File-Based Rebalance in FTS::
Prior to version{nbsp}7.1, FTS index partitions were rebuilt from scratch on each node during rebalance operations.
Under version{nbsp}7.1, the index partition files are copied to the nodes, allowing for faster rebalancing.
File-based rebalancing can be enabled and disabled through a REST-API call described in the xref:fts:fts-advanced-settings-disable-file-transfer-rebalance.adoc[Disable File Transfer Balance API call] document.

Increase in the Number of Full-Text Indexes Supported::
FTS now supports up to 500 index partitions per cluster.
Note also that for version 7.0.3 or greater, Search indexes may use up to 90% less disk space.
For the potential savings to take effect, the index will need to be rebuilt; or at least will need to ingest data for the segments to be merged and rebuilt on the disk.

=== Index Service Enhancements

The Index Service now provides:

Smart Batching::
Allows the rebuilding of indexes, during rebalance, to be maintained at an optimal performance-level.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#smart-batching[Smart Batching].

Array Flattening::
Whereby the elements of arrays can be more efficiently indexed.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.adoc#query-predicate-format[Format of Query Predicate].

Indexing documents with Missing Key Fields::

Prior to version 7.1.2, documents that did not hold a field given as part of an index definition where not included in index. +
Couchbase 7.1.2{plus} will include these documents if the optional `INCLUDE MISSING` clause is used when the index is defined. +
See the xref:guides:create-index.adoc#indexes-for-missing-leading-key[Creating Indexes guide] for more information.

=== Backup/Recovery Enhancements

Direct Backup to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Storage::
The cbbackupmr CLI and the Backup Service now supports direct backup to GCP cloud storage.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-cloud.adoc[].

Resume option for cbbackupmgr restore::
The --resume option for cbbackupmgr restore allows you to resume a restore that has failed due to a temporary environmental issue.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-restore.adoc[].

[Developer Preview] Direct Backup to Azure Blob Containers::
The cbbackupmgr CLI direct backup to Azure blob containers is available for Developer Preview in 7.1.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-cloud.adoc[].

[Developer Preview] Encrypted Backups::
Encrypted backups is available for Developer Preview in 7.1 with both cbbackupmgr CLI and the Backup Service.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-encryption.adoc[].

[Deprecation Reminder] cbbackup and cbrestore::
The cbbackup and cbrestore utilities have been deprecated for the Community Edition (CE) since 7.0, and they will be removed in the future.
(For the Enterprise Edition, cbbackup and cbrestore have been deprecated since 5.0.)
The cbbackupmgr CLI can be used on both CE and EE.
