== New Features and Enhancements

This section describes the new features and enhancements in this release.

=== Multiple Root Certificates

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, a Couchbase-Server cluster could maintain at most _one_ root certificate: all nodes and all clients were obliged to rely on this certificate's authority.
From version 7.1, Couchbase Server permits multiple root certificates to maintained in a _trust store_ for the cluster.
This allows an individual node either to use a CA that is also used by one or more other nodes; or to use a CA that is used by no other node.
This may be used during CA certificate rotation: a new CA is uploaded, node certificates are changed one by one, and finally, the old CA is removed.

Couchbase Server additionally uses its list of trusted certificates to verify:

* Client certificates (when client certificate authentication is enabled).

* The identities of cluster nodes (when node-to-node encryption is enabled).

* The identities of nodes that join the cluster (when the server has been provisioned with certificates).

* The identity of LDAP servers (when TLS has been turned on, in the LDAP settings).

For more information, see xref:learn:security/using-multiple-cas.adoc[Using Multiple Root Certificates].

=== Private Key Formats

In version 7.1, Couchbase Server supports _PKCS #1_ and _PKCS #8_ &#8212; in each case, only for use with private keys:

* _PKCS #1_ can be used for _unencrypted_ private keys only.

* _PKCS #8_ can be used for both _unencrypted_ and _encrypted_ private keys: note that the user-specified `EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo` must use _PKCS #5 v2_ algorithms.

=== JSON Passphrase Registration

If a node-certificate to be loaded is associated with an encrypted private key, a procedure can be defined to allow Couchbase Server to access and use the keyâ€™s passphrase, when use of the key is required: the passphrase can be registered by means of a JSON object.
For information, see xref:rest-api:upload-retrieve-node-cert.adoc#json-passphrase-registration[JSON Passphrase Registration].
