*Couchbase Analytics*

Couchbase Server 6.0 delivers the first production release of Couchbase Analytics.
Our Analytics service enables you to analyze your JSON data in real time without the need to extract, transform, load (ETL) your data into a separate system.
It allows you to develop insight-driven applications quickly and easily using the same SDKs.
It removes the need for ETL and the complexity of managing a separate analytics system.
Couchbaseâ€™s unique architecture for Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) allows operational and analytical queries to run concurrently without impacting one another, providing the workload isolation required for production deployments.
To learn more about this service, or to see what's new in this production release, see xref:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics].

*Support for Timers in Couchbase Functions*

This release adds support for timers in Couchbase Functions.
Timers enable asynchronous compute in reference to wall-clock events.
They are constructs which developers can use to specify a routine (business logic) to be triggered at a future time.
For more information, see xref:eventing:eventing-language-constructs.adoc#timers[Timers].
