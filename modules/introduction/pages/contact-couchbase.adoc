== Options for Making Contact

You can get in touch with Couchbase in any of the following ways:

* _Contact Couchbase Support_: If you are a customer of Couchbase Server _Enterprise Edition_, and have a support contract, you can log into the Couchbase Customer Support Portal, and so make contact with Couchbase staff-members, who will provide guidance and assist with any problems you are encountering.
Email and phone support are also available.
* _Participate in a Forum_: Multiple online forums are available, whereby you can post a question, and get answers; both from Couchbase employees and from members of the Couchbase community of developers and administrators.
* _Submit a ticket_: Couchbase lets you use _JIRA_ software, to report issues as individual _tickets_.
* _Submit documentation changes_: If you find errors in Couchbase documentation, you can make your own edits to the source; and directly submit your changes to the Couchbase documentation team.

Further details are provided below.

[#submit_a_ticket]
== Submit a Ticket

If you have a JIRA account, you can submit tickets to Couchbase.
When submitting, include all information that might be appropriate.
For example:

* A description of your environment (package installation, build number, operating system, etc).
* All steps required to reproduce the issue.
This should include all relevant expression-names, parameters, flags, and values; with sample output in verbose mode from repeated executions, using different values.
* Logs from all cluster-nodes.
* Query-results from the command-line, when failures have occurred through use of the UI; and _vice versa_.

[#submit_documentation_changes]
== Submit Documentation Changes

If you find a documentation-error, to fix it, you can left-click on the link at the upper right of each page:

[#edit_on_git_hub]

This takes you to an interactive edit-pane, in which the page-source can be directly edited:

When you have made your edits, left-click on the btn:[Commit changes] button, at the lower left:

This allows you to open a _pull request_, which will be reviewed by Couchbase staff-members, prior to integration of your submitted changes into the documentation-set.
