=== Cluster Manager
* *https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-34155[MB-34155]:*
New auto-failover setting `failoverOnDataDiskNonResponsiveness` marks a node running the Data Service as unhealthy and allows auto-failover to kick in when all current IO operations on Reader and Writer threads have not completed for a specified number of seconds.
This allows a node to auto-failover if the underlying storage device becomes read-only.
