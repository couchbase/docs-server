=== Vector Search

* On x86 platforms, Vector Search now uses the processor's Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) feature to improve performance. 
Because of this change,  Couchbase Server running on x86 platforms requires a processor that supports these AVX2 instructions.
For more information, see xref:install:pre-install.adoc#vector_cpu_requirements[Vector Search CPU Requirements].
