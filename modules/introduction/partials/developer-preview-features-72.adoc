=== Support for Python Machine Learning Models (Python UDFs)

Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) enable the evaluation of Python functions in the context of an {sqlpp} query.
The complexity of these UDFs can range from simple Python code snippets to trained models that are based on machine-learning frameworks like scikit-learn or PyTorch.

=== Encrypted Backups

Encrypted backups are available with both cbbackupmgr CLI and the Backup Service.
See xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-encryption.adoc[].
