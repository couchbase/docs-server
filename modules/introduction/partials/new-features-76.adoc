* A required minimum can be established for the number of replicas configured for a bucket.
See xref:rest-api:setting-minimum-replicas.adoc[Setting a Replica-Minimum].

* In each user-created or sample bucket, a `_system` scope is created and maintained by default. This scope contains collections used by Couchbase services, for service-specific data.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#system-scope-and-its-collections[_system Scope and its Collections].

* Node-connectivity can be checked, prior to the creation of an XDCR reference.
See xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-connection-precheck.adoc[Checking Connections].

* Binary documents can optionally be included in, or excluded from XDCR replications.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-filter-binary[Filtering Binary Documents].

* Security settings now provide additional parameters, for the configuration of Couchbase-Server user-password hashing.
See xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

* Credentials for Couchbase-Server internal users can now be rotated at any time, by means of the REST API.
See xref:rest-api:rest-rotate-internal-credentials.adoc[Rotate Internal Credentials].
