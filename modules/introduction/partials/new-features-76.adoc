* A required minimum can be established for the number of replicas configured for a bucket.
See xref:rest-api:setting-minimum-replicas.adoc[Setting a Replica-Minimum].

* In each user-created or sample bucket, a `_system` scope is created and maintained by default. This scope contains collections used by Couchbase services, for service-specific data.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#system-scope-and-its-collections[_system Scope and its Collections].

* Node-connectivity can be checked, prior to the creation of an XDCR reference.
See xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-connection-precheck.adoc[Checking Connections].

* Binary documents can optionally be included in, or excluded from XDCR replications.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-filter-binary[Filtering Binary Documents].

* A _rank_ can be assigned to each bucket on the cluster, whereby each bucket's handling by the _rebalance_ process is appropriately prioritized.
Assignment can be made by means of either the CLI or the REST API.
This feature allows the cluster's most mission-critical data to be rebalanced most quickly.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

* Security settings now provide additional parameters, for the configuration of Couchbase-Server user-password hashing.
See xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

* Credentials for Couchbase-Server internal users can now be rotated at any time, by means of the REST API.
See xref:rest-api:rest-rotate-internal-credentials.adoc[Rotate Internal Credentials].

* By default, `cbbackupmgr` now backs up and restores user groups and users, including roles and permissions. User passwords are saved in the backup in a hashed format. When restoring a backup, `cbbackupmgr` defaults to not overwriting existing users in the database with identically named users in the backup. You can change these default `cbbackupmgr` behaviors using the new `--disable-users` and `--overwrite-users` command-line arguments. See  xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-config.adoc[cbbackupmgr config] and xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr restore] for more about these new arguments.

* The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) REST API has a new `backup` endpoint that lets you backup and restore user and user groups. See xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc#backup-and-restore-users-and-groups[Backup and Restore Users and Groups]. 

* LDAP authentication now supports using regular expressions to map users to LDAP users and groups. 
You can supply multiple regular expressions that Couchbase attempts to match against the user name supplied during an authentication attempt. 
This feature gives you greater flexibility when authenticating users. 
For example, you can use a regular expression to map the domain name in an email address to an LDAP organization.
