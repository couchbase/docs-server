* Couchbase Server 7.6 adds support for the following platforms:
+
--
** Debian Linux 12 (Bookworm)
** macOS 13 "Ventura"
** macOS 14 "Sonoma"
--
+
See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[] for a full list of supported platforms.

* A required minimum can be established for the number of replicas configured for a bucket.
See xref:rest-api:setting-minimum-replicas.adoc[Setting a Replica-Minimum].

* In each user-created or sample bucket, a `_system` scope is created and maintained by default. This scope contains collections used by Couchbase services, for service-specific data.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#system-scope-and-its-collections[_system Scope and its Collections].

* You can now migrate buckets from one storage backend to another. 
This feature supports migrating buckets from Couchstore to Magma and from Magma to Couchstore. 
You can migrate buckets while the database continues running.
To complete the migration you must trigger a swap rebalance or a graceful failover followed by a full recovery on each node that contains the bucket.
See xref:manage:manage-buckets/migrate-bucket.adoc[].

* Node-connectivity can be checked, prior to the creation of an XDCR reference.
See xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-connection-precheck.adoc[Checking Connections].

* Binary documents can optionally be included in, or excluded from XDCR replications.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-filter-binary[Filtering Binary Documents].

* A _rank_ can be assigned to each bucket on the cluster, whereby each bucket's handling by the _rebalance_ process is appropriately prioritized.
Assignment can be made by means of either the CLI or the REST API.
This feature allows the cluster's most mission-critical data to be rebalanced most quickly.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].



* The `cbbackupmgr` command has a new `--enable-users` flag that backs up user groups and users including roles and permissions. 
When you supply the new argument, `cbbackupmgr` saves user passwords in the backup in a hashed format. 
When restoring a backup, `cbbackupmgr` defaults to not overwriting existing users in the database with identically named users in the backup. 
You can change this default behavior using the new `--overwrite-users` command-line argument. 
See  xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-config.adoc[cbbackupmgr config] and xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr restore] for more about user backup.



* You can choose to have the rebalance process move an index's files between nodes instead of rebuilding them from scratch. 
This setting improves rebalance performance as moving the files is faster than rebuilding them. 
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#index-rebalance-methods[Index Rebalance Methods]

* LDAP authentication now supports using regular expressions to map users to LDAP users and groups. 
You can supply multiple regular expressions that Couchbase attempts to match against the user name supplied during an authentication attempt. 
This feature gives you greater flexibility when authenticating users. 
For example, you can use a regular expression to map the domain name in an email address to an LDAP organization. 
See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#ldap-advanced-mapping[Advanced Query] under xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#enable-ldap-user-authentication[User Authentication Enablement].

* You can now have Couchbase Server prune rotated audit logs after a period of time. 
You set how long  Couchbase Server should keep audit logs by using the new `pruneAge` parameter for the `/settings/audit` endpoint. 
The default value of 0 means that Couchbase Server does not prune audit logs. 
See xref:rest-api:rest-auditing.adoc[Configure Auditing].

* Couchbase Server has a new service discovery endpoint to help you configure the Prometheus event monitoring system.
The old endpoint, named `/prometheus_sd_config.yaml` is now deprecated. 
The new endpoint is able to produce the same output as the old endpoint and has additional features.
See xref:manage:monitor/set-up-prometheus-for-monitoring.adoc[Configure Prometheus to Collect Couchbase Metrics].

* Disk usage statistics now  include transient files in progress, state files, and configuration files.

* Two changes in Couchbase Server 7.6 affect the `maxTTL` setting for collections:
+
--
** In earlier versions, you could only set a collection's `maxTTL` setting when creating the collection. 
You can now change the `maxTTL` setting on a collection after creation.
** You can now set a collection's `maxTTL` to -1 to prevent a bucket's non-zero `maxTTL` setting from causing documents in the collection to expire automatically. 
This new setting is useful if you want most of the documents in a bucket to automatically expire, but want to prevent the documents in one or more collections from expiring by default.

+
See xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[] for more information.

=== Security and Authentication Changes

Couchbase Server 7.6 has following security and authentication related changes:

* Couchbase Server now supports using Public-Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #12 format certificates for node certificates. 
This format lets you bundle the node's private key, public key, and certificate chain into a single file.  
See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[] for more information.

* Couchbase Server now supports the X.509 Elliptic Curve Key cipher suites.
Elliptic Curve Key ciphers are less resource-intensive than other cipher suites. 
They're useful when communicating with resource-constrained devices such as IoT hardware.

* Couchbase Server no longer supports TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. 
When upgrading to version 7.6 or later, the upgrade process automatically sets  `minTLSVersion` to `tlsv1.2` if it's set to `tlsv1` or `tlsv1.1`.
Before you upgrade, be sure all the clients you use support TLS 1.2 or greater.
See xref:earn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc[] for more information.

* To prevent https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Thirteen_attack[LUCKY13 attacks^], Couchbase Server 7.6 removes the following ciphers from the default cipher list:
** TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
** TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
** TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHAa

* The Couchbase Server Web Console now supports using Structured Authentication Markup Language (SAML) for authentication. 
When you enable SAML authentication, a btn:[Sign In Using SSO] button appears on the Web Console login screen. 
This button lets users who have already authenticated with the SAML identity provider (Okta, for example) to skip having to enter credentials.  
See xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc#saml-authentication[SAML Authentication] for more information.

* Security settings now provide additional parameters, for the configuration of Couchbase-Server user-password hashing.
See xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

* Credentials for Couchbase-Server internal users can now be rotated at any time, by means of the REST API.
See xref:rest-api:rest-rotate-internal-credentials.adoc[Rotate Internal Credentials].

* The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) REST API has a new `backup` endpoint that lets you backup and restore user and user groups. 
See xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc#backup-and-restore-users-and-groups[Backup and Restore Users and Groups]. 

* You can now enable alerts for certificate expiration. 
When enabled, Couchbase Server alerts you when server, node, or client certificates are within 30 days of expiration. 
It sends a second alert when certificates expire.
