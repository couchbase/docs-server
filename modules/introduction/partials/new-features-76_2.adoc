=== Backup

* Users with the xref:learn:security/roles.adoc#read-only-admin[Read-Only Admin] role can now read backup information from the following Backup Service REST API endpoints:

** xref:rest-api:backup-get-cluster-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-manage-config.adoc[`/api/v1/config`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-repository-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/{repo-state}`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-task-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/{repo-state}/{task-name}/taskHistory`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-plan-info.adoc[`/api/v1/plan/`]

=== Cluster Manager

* Version 7.6.2 adds Cluster Manager metrics to help you monitor failovers and rebalances:
+
--
** `cm_auto_failover_count`: the number of auto-failovers that occurred. 
** `cm_auto_failover_enabled`: whether auto-failover is enabled.
** `cm_auto_failover_max_count`: the maximum number of auto-failovers allowed before Cluster Manager disables auto-failover.
** `cm_failover_total`: The total number of non-graceful failovers that have occurred.
** `cm_graceful_failover_total`: The total number of graceful failovers that have occurred.
** `cm_is_balanced`: Whether the Cluster Manager is balanced. Only reported by orchestrator nodes and only reported every 30 seconds.
** `cm_rebalance_in_progress`: Whether there is a rebalance occurring. Only reported by the orchestrator node.
** `cm_rebalance_progress`: An estimate of the progress of the current rebalance. Only reported by the orchestrator.
** `cm_rebalance_total`: The total number of rebalances that have occurred.

* You can now set the number of threads each Backup Service node uses when backing up data.
For example, if you find backups cause performance issues on your cluster, you can reduce the number of threads the Backup Service uses.
Reducing the number of threads also reduces the number of concurrent client connections the Backup Service makes to retrieve data.
See xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc#threads[Thread Usage] for more information.
