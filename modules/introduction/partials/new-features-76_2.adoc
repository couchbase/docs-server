[#backup_762]
=== Backup

* Users with the xref:learn:security/roles.adoc#read-only-admin[Read-Only Admin] role can now read backup information from the following Backup Service REST API endpoints:

** xref:rest-api:backup-get-cluster-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-manage-config.adoc[`/api/v1/config`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-repository-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/{repo-state}`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-task-info.adoc[`/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/{repo-state}/{task-name}/taskHistory`]
** xref:rest-api:backup-get-plan-info.adoc[`/api/v1/plan/`]

* You can now set the number of threads each Backup Service node uses when backing up data.
For example, if you find backups cause performance issues on your cluster, you can reduce the number of threads the Backup Service uses.
Reducing the number of threads also reduces the number of concurrent client connections the Backup Service makes to retrieve data.
See xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc#threads[Thread Usage] for more information.

=== Cluster Manager

* Version 7.6.2 adds Cluster Manager metrics to help you monitor failovers and rebalances:
+
--
** `cm_auto_failover_count`: the number of auto-failovers that occurred. 
** `cm_auto_failover_enabled`: whether auto-failover is enabled.
** `cm_auto_failover_max_count`: the maximum number of auto-failovers allowed before Cluster Manager disables auto-failover.
** `cm_failover_total`: The total number of non-graceful failovers that have occurred.
** `cm_graceful_failover_total`: The total number of graceful failovers that have occurred.
** `cm_is_balanced`: Whether the Cluster Manager is balanced. Only reported by orchestrator nodes and only reported every 30 seconds.
** `cm_rebalance_in_progress`: Whether there is a rebalance occurring. Only reported by the orchestrator node.
** `cm_rebalance_progress`: An estimate of the progress of the current rebalance. Only reported by the orchestrator.
** `cm_rebalance_total`: The total number of rebalances that have occurred.

[#query_762]
=== Query Service

* In Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 and later, language constructs that may allow for code injection, speculative execution attacks, or side channel attacks have been removed from JavaScript user-defined functions in the Query service.
For details, see xref:javascript-udfs:javascript-functions-with-couchbase.adoc#restricted-features[JavaScript Functions for Query].

[#index_762]
=== Index Service

* From version 7.6.2, index creation operates in deferred build mode by default.
In deferred build mode, creating an index does not trigger the index build phase: you must trigger the index build before you can use the index.
For details, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createindex.adoc[CREATE INDEX].

[#search_762]
=== Search Service

* Version 7.6.2 adds multiple improvements to the Search Service, including xref:vector-search:vector-search.adoc[Vector Search]:
+
** xref:vector-search:vector-search.adoc[Vector Search] now automatically adds a xref:search:search-request-params.adoc#match_none[match_none] query object to your Vector Search queries.
This means you can run a pure Vector Search without adding a `query` object to your Search request.
** The total dimension support for xref:vector-search:vector-search.adoc[Vector Search] has been increased from 2048 to 4096 array elements.
** xref:vector-search:vector-search.adoc[Vector Search] now supports vectors encoded as base64 strings.
+
Add a base64-encoded vector to your Search index with the new `vector_base64` field data type, then use the `vector_base64` object in your Search request. 
** Use the Couchbase Server Web Console to edit and generate a full curl command for a Search request, with a new built-in code editor.
Use the curl command to run a Search query with the Search REST API.
** Use the Search Service to index and search for metadata stored in Extended Attributes (XATTRs) fields inside your documents.
+
Use the new xref:search:create-xattrs-mapping.adoc[XATTRs mapping type] in a Search index, then add the prefix `_$xattrs.` to a xref:search:search-request-params.adoc#field[field object] in your Search request.
You can also use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc[] from {sqlpp} to search for XATTRs data.
+
TIP: You must use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc[META function] to select the XATTRs field you want to search for an uncovered query, or any {sqlpp} query without a suitable Search index.
Use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/searchfun.adoc#search_meta[SEARCH_META function] to select XATTRs fields when you do have a suitable Search index. 

[#eventing_762]
=== Eventing Service

* Version 7.6.2 adds the following improvements to the Eventing Service:
+
** The new xref:eventing:eventing-language-constructs.adoc#base64_call[`base64Encode()` and `base64Decode()` functions] let you pack large arrays of floats as base64-encoded strings when you use Eventing to generate vector embeddings.
+
* The new xref:eventing:eventing-advanced-keyspace-accessors.adoc#advanced-subdoc-array-op-lookupin[Sub-Document LOOKUPIN operation] lets you search for a specific field in a document without having to search and retrieve the entire document.
+
You can now fetch and modify a document's Extended Attributes (XATTRs) in xref:eventing:eventing-advanced-keyspace-accessors.adoc#advanced-subdoc-array-op-lookupin[Sub-Document LOOKUPIN] and xref:eventing:eventing-advanced-keyspace-accessors.adoc#advanced-subdoc-array-op-mutatein[Sub-Document MUTATEIN] operations.

[#tools_762]
=== Tools

* From version 7.6.2, the Couchbase Server tools package includes the `cbq` shell, alongside the previously-provided tools such as `cbimport`, `cbexport`, and `cbbackupmgr`.
For details, see xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc#server-tools-packages[CLI Reference].
