* The following new platforms are supported:

** RHEL 9

** Oracle Linux 9

** Ubuntu 22 LTS

+
See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms, and notes on deprecated platforms.

* _Per Collection Change-History_.
A _change history_ can be maintained for all collections within a bucket.
Every change made to a document within the collection is included in the change history for the bucket.
A maximum size for the change history can be specified; in bytes, and also in seconds.
+
For an overview, see xref:learn:data/change-history.adoc[Change History].
For information on establishing change-history default settings, at bucket-creation time, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
For information on switching change-history _deduplication_ on or off for a specific collection, see xref:rest-api:creating-a-collection.adoc[Creating and Editing a Collection].
To examine the change-history de-duplication status for each collection in a bucket, see the xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections] option for `cbstats`.
To read the change history, use the xref:4.1@kafka-connector::index.adoc[Kafka 4.1 Connector].

* New alerts are provided for _change-history size threshold_ and _Index Service low residence threshold_.
See xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-email-notifications.adoc[Setting Alerts].

* Block size for _Magma_ storage can now be configured, when a bucket is created.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

* The tools `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport` can now specify that an alternate address be used, using the `network=external` option, when connecting from an external network.
See *Host Formats* information in xref:backup-restore:backup-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr], xref:tools:cbimport.adoc[cbimport], and xref:tools:cbexport.adoc[cbexport].

* New metrics are provided for tracking XDCR _conflict resolution_ on the target cluster.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc#monitoring-conflict-resolution[Monitoring Conflict Resolution on the Target Cluster].

* The `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport` tools are available in a tools package that can be downloaded.
See xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc#server-tools-packages[Server Tools Packages].

* Capella CAs are automatically trusted by XDCR, and so do not need to be specified when enabling fully secure replications from Couchbase Enterprise Server to Capella.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc#capella-trusted-cas[Capella Trusted CAs].
