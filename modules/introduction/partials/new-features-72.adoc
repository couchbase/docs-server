* _Per Collection Change-History_.
A _change history_ can be maintained for all collections within a bucket.
Every change made to a document within the collection is included in the change history for the bucket.
A maximum size for the change history can be specified; in bytes, and also in seconds.

For information on establishing change-history default settings, at bucket-creation time, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
For information on switching change-history _deduplication_ on or off for a specific collection, see xref:rest-api:creating-a-collection.adoc[Creating and Editing a Collection].
To examine the change-history' de-duplication status for each collection in a bucket, see the xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections] option for `cbstats`.
