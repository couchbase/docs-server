* _Per Collection Change-History_.
A _change history_ can be maintained for all collections within a bucket.
Every change made to a document within the collection is included in the change history for the bucket.
A maximum size for the change history can be specified; in bytes, and also in seconds.

For information on establishing change-history default settings, at bucket-creation time, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
For information on switching change-history _deduplication_ on or off for a specific collection, see xref:rest-api:creating-a-collection.adoc[Creating and Editing a Collection].
To examine the change-history de-duplication status for each collection in a bucket, see the xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections] option for `cbstats`.
For instructions on reading the change history, see the xref:4.1@kafka-connector:release-notes.adoc#v4.1.11[Release Notes for Kafka 4.1.11].

* Block size for _Magma_ storage can now be configured, when a bucket is created.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

* The tools `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport` can now specify that an alternate address be used, when connecting from an external network. See xref:backup-restore:backup-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr], xref:tools:cbimport.adoc[cbimport], and xref:tools:cbexport.adoc[cbexport].
