See xref:install:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Platforms] for the complete list of supported platforms, and notes on deprecated platforms.

* _Cost Based Optimizer for Analytics_ (_CBO_).
The cost-based optimizer for Analytics chooses the optimal plan to execute an Analytics query.
The cost-based optimizer gathers and utilizes samples from Analytics collections, and then queries the samples at query planning time to estimate the cost of each operation.
+
The Analytics Service introduces new syntax for managing samples, and provides parameters and hints to help specify the behavior of the cost-based optimizer.
See xref:analytics:5b_cbo.adoc[Cost-Based Optimizer for Analytics].

* _Time Series Queries_.
Time series data is any data which changes over time.
It is usually collected frequently, in regular or irregular intervals, from a device or a process.
+
The Query Service provides a standard format for time series data, which promotes compact storage and quick processing, and introduces a _TIMESERIES function to query time series data.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/time-series.adoc[Time Series Data] and the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/timeseries.adoc[_TIMESERIES Function].

* _Change History_.
A change history can be maintained for collections in a bucket.
Changes to documents within the collections are included in the change history.
A maximum size for the change history can be specified in bytes or seconds.
See xref:learn:data/change-history.adoc[Change History].
+
For information on establishing change-history default settings, at bucket-creation time, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
For information on switching the change history on or off for a specific collection, see xref:rest-api:creating-a-collection.adoc[Creating and Editing a Collection].
To examine the change-history status for each collection in a bucket, see the xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections] option for `cbstats`.
To read the change history, use the xref:4.1@kafka-connector::index.adoc[Kafka 4.1 Connector].

* New alerts are provided for _change-history size threshold_ and _Index Service low residence threshold_.
See xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-email-notifications.adoc[Setting Alerts].

* You can now configure block size for _Magma_ storage when you create a bucket.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

* New metrics are provided for tracking XDCR _conflict resolution_ on the target cluster.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc#monitoring-conflict-resolution[Monitoring Conflict Resolution on the Target Cluster].

* Couchbase Server now checks node certificates to ensure a node-name is correctly identified with a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) when certificates are uploaded and when a node is added or joins a cluster.
See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#node-certificate-validation[Node-Certificate Validation].

* The Analytics Service now supports external datasets on _Google Cloud Platform_ (GCP) storage.
You can manage these datasets using the UI or the Analytics Links REST API.
See xref:analytics:manage-links.adoc[] and xref:analytics:rest-links.adoc[].

* When connecting from an external network, you can now use the `network=external` option to specify an alternate address when using `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport`.
See *Host Formats* information in xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr], xref:tools:cbimport.adoc[cbimport], and xref:tools:cbexport.adoc[cbexport].

* You can now download the `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport` tools from a tools package.
This enables developers or testers to use the tools from machines on which Couchbase Server is not installed.
See xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc#server-tools-packages[Server Tools Packages].

* _Capella_ databases use Certificate Authorities (CAs), to establish secure connections: these CAs are now automatically trusted when you use Couchbase Web Console or the REST API to establish _fully secure_ XDCR connections between Capella databases and Couchbase Enterprise Server 7.2+.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc#capella-trusted-cas[Capella Trusted CAs].
