* _Time Series Queries_.

* _Per Collection Change-History_.
Maintain a _change history_ for all collections in a bucket.
Changes to documents in collections are included in the change history for the bucket.
A maximum size for the change history can be specified in bytes or seconds.
See xref:learn:data/change-history.adoc[Change History].
+
For information on establishing change-history default settings, at bucket-creation time, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
For information on switching change-history _deduplication_ on or off for a specific collection, see xref:rest-api:creating-a-collection.adoc[Creating and Editing a Collection].
To examine the change-history status for each collection in a bucket, see the xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections] option for `cbstats`.
To read the change history, use the xref:4.1@kafka-connector::index.adoc[Kafka 4.1 Connector].

* New alerts are provided for _change-history size threshold_ and _Index Service low residence threshold_.
See xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-email-notifications.adoc[Setting Alerts].

* You can now configure block size for _Magma_ storage when you create a bucket.
See xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

* New metrics are provided for tracking XDCR _conflict resolution_ on the target cluster.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc#monitoring-conflict-resolution[Monitoring Conflict Resolution on the Target Cluster].

* Couchbase Server now checks node certificates to ensure a node-name is correctly identified with a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) when certificates are uploaded and when a node is added or joins a cluster.
See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#node-certificate-validation[Node-Certificate Validation].

* The Analytics Service now supports external datasets on _Google Cloud Platform_ (GCP) storage.
You can manage these datasets using the UI or the Analytics Links REST API.
See xref:analytics:manage-links.adoc[] and xref:analytics:rest-links.adoc[].

* When connecting from an external network, you can now use the `network=external` option to specify an alternate address when using `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport`.
See *Host Formats* information in xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr], xref:tools:cbimport.adoc[cbimport], and xref:tools:cbexport.adoc[cbexport].

* You can now download the `cbbackupmgr`, `cbimport`, and `cbexport` tools from a tools package.
This enables developers or testers to use the tools from machines on which Couchbase Server is not installed.
See xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc#server-tools-packages[Server Tools Packages].

* _Capella_ uses Certificate Authority (CA).
CAs are automatically trusted when you use Couchbase Web Console or the REST API to establish _fully secure_ XDCR connections between Capella databases and Couchbase Enterprise Server 7.2+.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc#capella-trusted-cas[Capella Trusted CAs].
