= General tips

[abstract]
General tips include various initial diagnostics activities.

The following are some general tips that may be useful before performing any more detailed investigations:

* Try pinging the node.
* Try connecting to Couchbase Server Web Console on the node.
* Try to use `telnet` to connect to the various ports that Couchbase Server uses.
* Try reloading the web page.
* Check firewall settings (if any) on the node.
Make sure there isn’t a firewall between you and the node.
On a Windows system, for example, the Windows firewall might be blocking the ports (*Control Panel > Windows Firewall*.
* Make sure that the documented ports are open between nodes and make sure the data operation ports are available to clients.
* Check your browser’s security settings.
* Check any other security software installed on your system, such as antivirus programs.
* Generate a Diagnostic Report for use by Couchbase Technical Support to help determine what the problem is.
There are two ways of collecting this information:
 ** Click the [.uicontrol]*Collect info* tab on the [.uicontrol]*Log* page and select the nodes to obtain a snapshot of your system’s configuration and log information for deeper analysis.
Send the collected log files to the Couchbase support.
 ** Run [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` on each node within your cluster.
This command requires the name of the zip file, and it must be run individually on each node within the cluster.

To run, you must specify the name of the file to be generated:
