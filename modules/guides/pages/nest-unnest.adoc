:description: How to nest and unnest arrays of embedded objects.

{description}

== Introduction

Couchbase Server is a document database.
Data is stored as JSON documents in keyspaces, rather than as rows in tables.
This means that documents can contain arrays of embedded subdocuments.
// tag::intro[]
{sqlpp} provides syntax which enables you to _nest_ (create) or _unnest_ (flatten) arrays of embedded documents in a query.
// end::intro[]

== Nesting Data

Nesting is like creating a join from a document to documents from another data source.
However, in the resultset, the nested documents are embedded in an array within the parent document.

{sqlpp} offers several types of nest syntax.
This guide focuses on ANSI nest, which is the recommended nest syntax.
It enables you to nest objects from one data source within objects from another, using arbitrary fields.

To create a nest:

1. Use the FROM clause to specify the data source on the left-hand side of the nest.
This may be a keyspace identifier, a subquery, or a subquery.

2. Use the NEST clause to specify the data source on the right-hand side of the nest.
This must be a keyspace reference.

3. Use the ON keyword to specify the nest predicate.
This is a condition that must be met in order to nest an object on the right-hand side within an object on the left-hand side.

TIP: To use a xref:learn:data/data.adoc#keys[document key] in the nest predicate, use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc#meta[META()] function to return the `id` field from the document metadata.

====
For example, the following query selects a route and the associated airline.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$query/ansi-nest-example.n1ql[]
----

<.> The `route` keyspace is the left-hand side of the nest.
<.> The `airline` keyspace is the right-hand side of the nest.
<.> The `airlineid` field on the left-hand side must be equal to the document key on the right-hand side.
====

NOTE: Before running a query containing a nest, make sure all the required indexes exist.
To check which indexes may be required, use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/advise.adoc[Index Advisor].

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/nest.adoc#section_tc1_nnx_1db[ANSI NEST Clause].

== Nest Types

ANSI nests support two types of nest: _inner nests_ and _left outer nests_.
(There is no provision for right outer nests, because objects from the right-hand side cannot be nested within an object that doesn't exist.)

=== Inner Nests

The default nest type is an inner nest.
An inner nest returns nested objects _only_ where a source object from the left-hand side of the nest matches a source object from the right-hand side of the nest.

image::inner-nest.png['Inner nest: the result contains only matching objects from the left-hand side and right-hand side']

To create an inner nest, omit the nest type, or optionally include the `INNER` keyword before the NEST clause.

====
For example, the following query lists only airports in Toulouse which have routes starting from them, and nests details of the routes.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-nest-inner.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-nest-inner.jsonc[tags=extract;ellipsis]
----
====

=== Left Outer Nests

A left outer nest returns nested objects using _all_ the source objects from the left-hand side of the nest, but only including source objects from the right-hand side of the nest if they match.

image::left-nest.png['Left outer nest: the result contains all objects from the left-hand side, and only matching objects from the right-hand side']

To create a left outer nest, include the `LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER` keywords before the NEST clause.

====
For example, the following query lists all airports in Toulouse, and nests details of any routes that start from each airport.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-nest-left.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-nest-left.jsonc[tags=extract;ellipsis]
----

<.> If there is no corresponding data object on the right-hand side of the nest, fields from the right-hand side are missing or null.
====

== Unnesting Data

Unnesting data is the opposite of nesting.
Unnesting is like creating a join from a parent document to subdocuments in an array within that document.
In the resultset, the subdocuments are flattened and joined to the parent document.

image::unnest.png['Unnest: the result contains subdocuments flattened and joined to their parent documents']

To unnest subdocuments from an array:

1. Use the FROM clause to specify the parent data source on the left-hand side of the unnest.
2. Use the UNNEST clause to specify the nested data on the right-hand side of the unnest.

====
For example, the following query unnests the schedule data from within the route document to get details of flights on Monday (day `1`).

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/unnest.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/unnest.jsonc[]
----
====
