== Creating the N1QL User-Defined Function

Before you can run the JavaScript function you have created (see xref:create-javascript-library.adoc[]), you will need to create a N1QL User-Defined Function to reference it. 
You can create a N1QL User-Defined Function by using:

* the UDF UI in the Query Workbench.
* the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc[standard N1QL `CREATE FUNCTION` DDL], using the _External Functions_ option to reference the Javascript function.
* the REST-API to execute a xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc[`CREATE FUNCTION`] call.

For more information on N1QL User Defined Functions in general, read xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/userfun.adoc[]

====
Query Workbench::
+
--
. Access the `UDF` screen from the administration console.

. Click on the `{plus}{nbsp}add function` link from the `UDFs` screen.

+
which will display the `Add Function` screen.

. Use the `Namespace` drop-down lists to select the bucket and scope where your Javascript function resides.

. Fill in the `Function Name` of your referencing function.

. Leave the `Parameters` as they are.
+
NOTE: The `...` in the parameters box denotes a variable length list of parameters.
This is why you don't have to fill in this field.

. Select `Javascript` for the function type.
A field will appear in the dialog with a list of available libraries in the namespace you selected.
+

+
From this list select the library containing your function. 

. Enter the name of the JavaScript function in the `Library Function Name` field.

REST API::
+
--
Run a `curl` command from the shell to add a N1QL User-Defined Function that calls your Javascript function.

[source, console]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/create-scoped-n1ql-udf-with-rest.sh[]
----
--

N1QL::
+
--
Execute the `CREATE FUNCTION` in the CBQ Shell to create the N1QL User-Defined Function:

[source, n1ql]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/create-scoped-n1ql-udf.n1ql[]
----
--
====

NOTE: The N1QL User-Defined Function will take the same scope as the JavaScript UDF it is referencing.

Having created your N1QL User-Defined Function, the xref:call-user-defined-function.adoc[next step] is to use a N1QL statement to call the function.
