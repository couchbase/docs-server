= Search Index JSON Properties

When you xref:guides:search/create-search-index-rest-api.adoc[create a Search index with the REST API], you need to add a JSON payload with the settings for your index.

Your JSON payload must contain the properties described in <<initial,>>, including the <<params,>>.

[#initial]
== Initial Settings 

The start of the JSON payload for a Search index contains important settings for your index: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$search/complex-search-index-payload.jsonc[tag=initial]

It contains the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|type |String |Yes a|

The type of index you want to create: 

* `fulltext-index`: Create a search index.
* `fulltext-alias`: Create an alias for a search index. 
For more information about search index alias, see xref:[]

The Search Service automatically generates a UUID for an index.

|sourceType |String |Yes |The `sourceType` is always `"gocbcore"`.

|sourceName |String |Yes a|
The name of the bucket where you want to create the index. 

The Search Service automatically finds the UUID for the bucket.

|sourceUUID |String |No |The UUID of the bucket where you want to create the index.

|sourceParams |Object |? |

|planParams |Object |Yes |An object that sets the index's partitions and replications. 
For more information, see <<planparams,>>.

|params |Object |Yes |An object that sets the index's type identifier, type mappings, and analyzers. 
For more information, see <<params,>>.
