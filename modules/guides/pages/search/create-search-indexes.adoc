= Create a Search Index 
:page-topic-type: concept 

You can create a Search index with: 

* The Couchbase Server Web Console or Couchbase Capella UI. 
* The Search Service REST API. 

TIP: If you're new to developing with the Search Service, xref:guides:search/create-search-index-ui.adoc[create a Search Index with the UI]. 
You can copy the JSON payload from the UI to create your index with the REST API. 

== Creating a Search Index With The UI

To xref:guides:search/create-search-index-ui.adoc[create a basic Search index], you only need to provide the following information: 

* The name of the index. 
* The bucket where you want to create the index. 

If you want to restrict the documents you add to an index, you can also: 

* Specify a scope or collection. 
* xref:guides:search/create-child-field.adoc[Add child fields] to add or remove fields from the index. 

For more information about how you can customize a Search index, see xref:guides:search/customize-index.adoc[].
