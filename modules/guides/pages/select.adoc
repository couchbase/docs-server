== Introduction

The xref:n1ql:query.adoc[Query Service] enables you to create, read, update, and delete data by means of xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[{sqlpp}], the Couchbase Server query language.
// tag::intro[]
To read data from a data source using {sqlpp}, you must use a selection query; that is, a query using the `SELECT` statement.
// end::intro[]

== Selecting

A selection query enables you to read information from a data source, perform operations on the data, and return the results.

To specify what the query should return, use the SELECT clause.

The following example uses the SELECT clause by itself to evaluate an expression.

== Specifying a Data Source

To specify the data source for a query, use the FROM clause.
For example, to get data from a collection, specify the path to that collection.

When you specify a FROM clause, you can use the SELECT clause to specify the fields that you want to return from that data source.
The set of fields returned by the query is known as the _projection_.

NOTE: Before you can query a data source, there must be an index on that data source.
The sample dataset already contains all the indexes you need to run the example queries in this guide.

====
The following query gets the name and city of every airport.

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$query/from-clause.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::example$query/from-clause.jsonc[tags=extract;ellipsis]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc[FROM Clause].

== Setting the Query Context

The query context enables you to specify a bucket and scope to resolve partial keyspace references within your queries.
When the query context is set, you can specify the data source in your queries using the collection name only.
This enhances the portability of your queries.

NOTE: The query context is only used to resolve partial keyspace references.
When a query specifies a data source using the full path to a keyspace, the query context is not used to resolve that keyspace.

[tabs]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
To set the query context:

. Using the *context* controls at the top right of the Query Editor, open the bucket drop-down menu and select the required bucket.
+
When a bucket is selected, a scope drop-down menu is displayed to the right.

. Open the scope drop-down menu and select the required scope.

image::tools:query-workbench-context.png["The query context menu with `travel-sample.inventory` selected"]
--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
To set the query context, use the `\SET` command with the `query_context` parameter.

'''

For example, the following command sets the query context to `travel-sample.inventory`.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$query/context-set.n1ql[]
----
--
====

Some legacy queries contain keyspace references consisting of the bucket name only, referring to the default collection in the default scope.
To specify the data source using the bucket name only, you must unset the query context.

[tabs]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
To unset the query context, using the *context* controls at the top right of the Query Editor, open the bucket drop-down menu and select `unset`.

The scope drop-down menu disappears.

image::tools:query-workbench-context-unset.png["The context controls with the query context unset"]
--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
To unset the query context, use `\UNSET` command with the `query_context` parameter.

'''

For example, the following command unsets the query context.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$query/context-unset.n1ql[]
----
--
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#query-context[Query Context].

== Filtering

To filter the results of the query, use the WHERE clause to specify a comparison expression.
Only records that satisfy the comparison expression are returned.

====
For example, the following query finds the name and city of every airport in the Anchorage timezone whose altitude is greater than or equal to 2100.

.Context
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/query-keyspace-idx.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/query-keyspace-idx.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE Clause].

== Limiting Results

To limit the number of documents returned by a query, use the `LIMIT` clause.

====
For example, the following query finds only 2 hotels with an empty room.

.Context
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/limit-number.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/limit-result.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/limit.adoc[LIMIT Clause].

== Ordering Results

To sort the documents in the resultset by one or more fields, use the `ORDER BY` clause.

====
For example, the following query lists cities in descending order and then landmarks in ascending order.

.Context
include::ROOT:partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/order-by.n1ql[]
----

.Results:
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/order-by.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/orderby.adoc[ORDER BY Clause].
