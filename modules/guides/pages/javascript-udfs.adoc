== Introduction

N1QL includes a large number of xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[operations and generic functions] that cover every aspect of data manipulation. 
In addition to the built-in functions, Couchbase also allows you to create your own extensions to the language.
Using User-Defined Functions, you can:

* Create reuseable, domain-specific functions for use in your applications.
* Execute complex logic that may be difficult to do in N1QL.
* Migrate from RDBMS stored procedures.

== User-Defined Functions with JavaScript

When you use JavaScript for the User Defined Function, the JavaScript that is supported in Couchbase shares the same constructs of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript[ECMAScript], though there are a number of restrictions and also extensions with the Couchbase JavaScript implementation.

== Next Steps

If you're looking to creating your own JavaScript libraries then there are number of guides to get you started.

* xref:call-user-defined-function.adoc[]

If you wish to look into the constructs and available in the language itself, then you can have a look through the following pages:
