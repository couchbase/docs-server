== Introduction

N1QL includes a large number of xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[operations and generic functions] that cover every aspect of data manipulation. 
In addition to the built-in functions, Couchbase also allows you to create your own extensions to the language using JavaScript.
Using JavaScript user-defined functions, you can:

* Create reuseable, domain-specific functions for use in your applications.
* Execute complex logic that may be difficult to do in N1QL.
* Migrate from RDBMS stored procedures.
* Use  N1QL statements embedded in your JavaScript to access and modify your data.
