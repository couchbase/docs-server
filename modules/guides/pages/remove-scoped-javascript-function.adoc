== Introduction

Removal of the JavaScript function is best carried out using the Query Workbench, especially if you have other functions contained in the same library.

== Remove a JavaScript Function

Use the Query WorkBench to remove a function from a library.

. Access the admin console of your server.
. From the `Dashboard` select btn:[Query] to access the Query WorkBench, then select btn:[UDF] from the menu running along the top of the dashboard area.
