:description: How to calculate aggregates and group the results.

== Introduction

You can use aggregate functions to perform calculations over multiple values.
Grouping enables you to display the results in groups.

== Aggregate Functions

To take multiple values from documents, perform calculations, and return a single value as the result, use an aggregate function.

For example, the following query finds the average altitude of airports in the airport keyspace.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT AVG(geo.alt) AS AverageAltitude FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airport;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "AverageAltitude": 870.1651422764228
  }
]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[Aggregate Functions].

=== Aggregating Distinct Values

To aggregate all values, omit the aggregate quantifier, or optionally include the `ALL` keyword before the function arguments.

For example, the following query finds the average number of airline route stops.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT AVG(stops) FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS AverageStops;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "AverageStops": 0.0002
  }
]
----
====

To aggregate distinct values only, include the `DISTINCT` keyword before the function arguments.

For example, the following query finds the average of distinct numbers of airline route stops.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT AVG(DISTINCT stops) FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS AverageStops;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "AverageStops": 0.5
  }
]
----
====

For more information, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc#aggregate-quantifier[Aggregate Quantifier].

=== Filtering the Aggregates

To filter the values used by an aggregate function, use the FILTER clause after the function.

For example, the following query finds the minimum value of a string field, only including strings that start with `"A"` or greater.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT MIN(name) FILTER (WHERE SUBSTR(name,0)>="A") AS MinName
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.hotel;
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "MinName": "AIRE NATURELLE LE GROZEAU Aire naturelle"
  }
]
----
====

For more information, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc#filter-clause[FILTER Clause].

== Grouping the Results

By default, an aggregate function returns a single result for all the documents that the query selects.
It is often more useful to group the documents (by a different field) and return the aggregate result for each group.

To group the results of an aggregate query, use the GROUP BY clause.
The following query groups unique landmarks by city.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/groupby.adoc[GROUP BY Clause].

=== Filtering the Groups

To filter the groups by an aggregate function, use the HAVING clause within the GROUP BY clause.
The following query groups unique landmarks by city, and specifies cities that have more than 180 landmarks.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by-having.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by-having.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/groupby.adoc#having-clause[HAVING Clause].

=== Defining an Expression within the GROUP BY Clause

To define an expression for use within the GROUP BY clause, use the LETTING clause before the HAVING clause.
The following clause uses an alias to define the minimum number of landmarks for each city.

====
[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by-letting.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/group-by-letting.jsonc[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/groupby.adoc#letting-clause[LETTING Clause].
