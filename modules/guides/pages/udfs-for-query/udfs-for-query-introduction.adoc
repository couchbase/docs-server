== Introduction

SQL++ includes a large number of xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[operations and generic functions] that cover every aspect of data manipulation. 
In addition to the built-in functions, Couchbase also allows you to create your own functions to extend the language, allowing you to build and re-use specialized functions in your application.

== Before you begin

You're going to be running through some live examples, so will need access to a Couchbase server. 
If you don't have one available then you have a number of options:

* You can https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[sign up to Capella], the Couchbase cloud service.
* You can xref:install:install-intro.adoc[install a standalone server on your local machine].
* You can run Couchbase as a xref:install:getting-started-docker.adoc[Docker instance].

NOTE: User-defined functions require the Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
This guide assumes that you are running version 7.1 or greater.

You will also need a basic understanding of Couchbase SQL++. (You can find tutorials for the query language xref:n1ql:tutorial.adoc[here]).

== Getting started
First, you will need to log into the administration console of your server:

.Login screen

Select btn:[Query] to access the Query Workbench, then select btn:[UDF] Query Workbench menu.

You are now in the User-Defined Functions screen.

== Next Steps

It's recommended that you follow these steps in order.
