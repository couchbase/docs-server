== Introduction

{sqlpp} includes a large number of xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[operations and generic functions] that cover every aspect of data manipulation. 
In addition to the built-in functions, Couchbase also allows you to create your own extensions to the language using JavaScript.
Using JavaScript user-defined functions, you can:

* Create reuseable, domain-specific functions for use in your applications.
* Execute complex logic that may be difficult to do in {sqlpp}.
* Migrate from RDBMS stored procedures.
* Use  {sqlpp} statements embedded in your JavaScript to access and modify your data.

// tag::what-you-need[]
If you're going to be following the examples, you'll need access to a Couchbase server. 
If you don't have one available then you have a number of options:

* You can https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[sign up to Capella], the Couchbase cloud service.
* You can xref:install:install-intro.adoc[install a standalone server on your local machine].
* You can run Couchbase as a xref:install:getting-started-docker.adoc[Docker instance].

NOTE: User-defined functions require the Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
This guide assumes that you are running version 7.1 or greater.


You can also xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Install Sample Buckets] which will be helpful for running some of the examples or testing code of your own.
 
You will need a basic understanding of Couchbase {sqlpp}. (You can find tutorials for the query language xref:n1ql:tutorial.adoc[here]).

You'll also find instructions for getting started with the CBQ Shell in xref:tools:cbq-shell.adoc[].

You're going to need a basic working knowledge of https://www.w3schools.com/js/[Javascript^].
