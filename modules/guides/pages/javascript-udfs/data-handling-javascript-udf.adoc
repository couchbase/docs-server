== Introduction

Javascript is procedural object-based language, and {sqlpp} is declarative in nature. 
Moreover, Couchbase naturally works with https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp[json] in its data handling, so the data returned from {sqlpp} statements are json objects. 

== Packing and unpacking JSON data in Javascript

If we look back at the `add` function:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add.js[]
----

When it's called as part of a {sqlpp} statement:

[source, n1ql]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-statement.n1ql[]
----

It returns its result packaged as a `json` object instead of a Javascript number:

[source, json]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-response.json5[]
----

When using the function as part of a statement call, the unpacking processing is handled by the query engine, so that a query such as:

[source, N1SQL]
----
select "true" as response where MyAdd(2000, 1) > 2000
----

will unpack the result of `MyAdd(2,2)` and apply the result to the `WHERE` clause:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "response": "true"
  }
]
----

== Transforming data in a Javascript UDF

If you're using a user-defined function, then the chances are that you want to perform some kind of transformation on the data received back from the function
