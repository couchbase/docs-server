== Introduction

Javascript is procedural object-based language, and {sqlpp} is declarative in nature. 
Moreover, Couchbase naturally works with https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp[json] in its data handling, so the data returned from {sqlpp} statements are json objects. 

If we look back at the `add` function:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add.js[]
----

When it's called as part of a {sqlpp} statement:

[source, n1ql]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-statement.n1ql[]
----

It returns its result packaged as a `json` object instead of a Javascript number:

[source, json]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-response.json5[]
----
