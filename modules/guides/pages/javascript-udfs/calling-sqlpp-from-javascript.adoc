== Introduction

As well as being able to call Javascript functions from {sqlpp}, you can also call {sqlpp} statements from inside your Javascript functions.

== Calling an {sqlpp} statement inline

You can embed an {sqlpp} statement directly in your Javascript code:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-airline.js.txt[]
----

Statements called in this way are executed synchronously; the statement will run to completion before the next line of code is run.
