== Introduction

As well as being able to call Javascript functions from N1QL, you can also call N1QL statements from inside your Javascript functions.

[#calling-statements-inline]
== Calling {sqlpp} statements inline

You can embed an {sqlpp} statement directly in your Javascript code:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-airline-inline-call.js[]
----

== Executing {sqlpp} statements  using the N1QL() call

In addition to the inline call, you can also execute an {sqlpp} statement by calling it from the `N1QL(…)` function.
[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-airline-n1sql-call.js[]
----

NOTE: Behind the scenes, the inline call method will generate the equivalent `N1QL` call, so whichever you choose to use will come down to personal preference.

== Returning values from {sqlpp} statements

As shown in the <<calling-statements-inline, examples above>>, embedded {sqlpp} statements  return values which can be used later on in your code.

The values returned from the statement calls are Javascript https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_iterables.asp[iterators^]: lists of values or documents returned from the database. 
In the next example, we're going to retrieve a list of the hotels stored in the `travel-sample` database:

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/select-hotels.js[]
----

<.> The inline {sqlpp} statement returns an iterator containing the items retrieved by the query.
<.> Using the standard Javascript iterator pattern to loop through the items returned in `q`.
<.> Add the current document from the iterator to the result array `res`.
<.> Once all the items have been retrieved, return the result array.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If an inline statement/N1QL call does not return a value, then the associated {sqlpp} statement is executed as part of a synchronous operation. i.e. the runtime will wait until the statement completes before moving on to the next line of Javascript.

If the inline statement/N1QL call returns a value then it is executed _asynchronously_: execution continues before the iterator is returned.
Each document is fetched from the bucket as it requested by the iterator.

== Passing Parameters to {sqlpp} statements

You can pass parameters from your Javascript to your {sqlpp} statements.
Parameters can either be `positional` or `named`.

Positional:: The parameters are applied to the statement in the order they appear in the list.
+
[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-airline-positional-pararamers.js[]
----

Named:: The parameters are given a mnemonic name attached to the value, so they can be included directly in the {sqlpp} statement.
+
[source, javascript]
----
include::example$javascript-udfs/add-airline-named-parameters.js[]
----
+
Note that the names of the parameters passed into the Javascript function are used in the {sqlpp} statement without any need to assign the parameters in a separate step.

[NOTE]
====
N1QL calls support both `named` and `positional` parameters.
Inline calls only support `named` parameters.
