:description: How to use the Index Advisor to recommend indexes for your queries.

[abstract]
{description}

== Introduction

You must create an index on a keyspace to be able to query that keyspace.
You can improve the performance of your query by using a well-designed index.
// tag::intro[]
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, the Index Advisor can analyze your queries and provide recommended indexes to optimize query response time.
// end::intro[]

The Index Advisor works with
xref:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc[SELECT],
xref:n1ql-language-reference/update.adoc[UPDATE],
xref:n1ql-language-reference/delete.adoc[DELETE], or
xref:n1ql-language-reference/merge.adoc[MERGE] queries.

[[advice-single]]
== Advice for a Single Query

To get index recommendations for a single query, you can use the Index Advisor in the Query Workbench, the `ADVISE` statement, or the `ADVISOR()` function.

[{tabs}]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
To get index recommendations for a single query, do one of the following:

* Enter the query in the Query Editor and click btn:[Index Advisor].
* Alternatively, if the query has already been executed, click *Advice* in the *Results* area.

The *Results* area displays the details of any current indexes used by the query, and any indexes that the Index Advisor recommends.
If there are any recommended indexes, you can click btn:[Create & Build Indexes] to create them.
Similarly, if there are any recommended covering indexes, you can click btn:[Create & Build Covering Indexes] to create them.

For more details, refer to xref:tools:query-workbench.adoc#index-advisor[Index Advisor].
--

ADVISE Statement::
+
--
To get index recommendations for a single query, use the `ADVISE` statement, followed by the query for which you want advice.

The `ADVISE` statement returns a JSON object containing the details of any current indexes used by the query, and any indexes that the Index Advisor recommends, along with the reasons for recommendation.
For each index, a N1QL statement is provided: you can copy and run this index statement to create the recommended index.

'''

The following query gets index advice for a single query.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/advise-indexes.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/advise-indexes.jsonc[]
----

For more details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/advise.adoc[ADVISE].
--

ADVISOR() Function::
+
--
To get index recommendations for a single query, use the `ADVISOR()` function with a string argument, representing the query.

The `ADVISOR()` function returns a JSON object containing the details of any current indexes used by each query, and any indexes that the Index Advisor recommends.
For each index, a N1QL statement is provided: you can copy and run this index statement to create the recommended index.

'''

The following query gets index advice for a single query.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-single.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-single.jsonc[]
----

For more details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/advisor.adoc#advisor-string[ADVISOR(string)].
====

[[advisor-function-multiple]]
== Advice for Multiple Queries

The `ADVISOR()` function also enables you to get index recommendations for multiple queries.

To get advice for multiple queries, use the `ADVISOR()` function with an array argument containing strings which represent each query.

TIP: You can query the xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc#sys-completed-req[system:completed_requests] catalog to get a list of recently-completed queries.

====
The following query gets index advice for recently-completed queries.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-recent.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-recent.jsonc[tags=current;recommended;ellipsis]
----
====

For more details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/advisor.adoc#advisor-array[ADVISOR(array)].

[[advisor-function-session]]
== Advice for a Session

The `ADVISOR()` function also enables you to get index recommendations for all the queries that you run in an Index Advisor session.

To run an Index Advisor session:

. Use the `ADVISOR()` function with a start object argument to start the session.
The object argument must contain the property `"action": "start"`, and must also contain a `"duration"` property, specifying the duration of the session.
+
The query returns a session ID, which you must use to get the results for this session, and to perform other actions on this session.

. Run all the queries for which you require index recommendations.

. If you want to stop the session early, use the `ADVISOR()` function with a stop object argument.
The object argument must contain the property `"action": "stop"`, and must also contain a `"session"` property, specifying the session ID.

. When the session is complete, use the `ADVISOR()` function with a get object argument to get the index recommendations.
The object argument must contain the property `"action": "get"`, and must also contain a `"session"` property, specifying the session ID.

NOTE: You can also use the `ADVISOR()` function to abandon a session without recording any results; to list active and completed sessions; and to purge the results of an Index Advisor session.

====
The following query starts an Index Advisor session with a duration of 1 hour.
All queries taking longer than 0 seconds will be collected.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-start.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-start.jsonc[]
----

'''

The following query stops the Index Advisor session early and saves the results.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-stop.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-stop.jsonc[]
----

'''

The following query returns index recommendations for the queries in the Index Advisor session.

[source,n1ql]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-get.n1ql[]
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$functions/advisor-get.jsonc[tags=current;covering;recommended;ellipsis]
----
