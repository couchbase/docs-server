== Introduction

A JavaScript function can be called like any other N1QL function using a suitable N1QL statement.
The Javascript function is not called directly; it is called through a N1QL User-Defined Function.

== Calling the N1QL User-Defined Function

A N1QL User-Defined Function can be called from anywhere that a standard N1QL function can be called.

. Enter the N1QL statement in the query editor to run your function:

--

REST API::
+
--
. Open up a shell session.
. Execute a `curl` command to run the function:
+
[source, console]
----

N1QL::
+
--

Run the `EXECUTE FUNCTION` function in the CBQ Shell.

[NOTE]
=====
The N1QL User-Defined Function can be used in any N1QL statement in exactly the same way as a standard built-in function.
