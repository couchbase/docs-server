:description: How to join data sources for a {sqlpp} selection query.

[abstract]
{description}

== Introduction

// tag::intro[]
You can use a _join_ to read objects from one data source, combine them with corresponding objects from another data source, and return the joined objects.
// end::intro[]
The first data source is said to be on the _left-hand side_ of the join and the second is said to be on the _right-hand side_ of the join.

== Creating a Join

{sqlpp} offers several types of join syntax.
This guide focuses on ANSI join, which is the recommended join syntax.
It enables you to join one data source to another using arbitrary fields.

To create a join:

1. Use the FROM clause to specify the data source on the left-hand side of the join.
This may be a keyspace identifier, a subquery, or a generic expression.

2. Use the JOIN clause to specify the data source on the right-hand side of the join.
For ANSI joins, this may be a keyspace identifier, a subquery, or a generic expression.

3. Use the ON keyword to specify the join predicate.
This is a condition that must be met to join an object on the right-hand side to an object on the left-hand side.

TIP: To use a xref:learn:data/data.adoc#keys[document key] in the join predicate, use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc#meta[META()] function to return the `id` field from the document metadata.

====
For example, the following query selects a route and the associated airline.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$query/ansi-join-example.n1ql[]
----

<.> The `route` keyspace is the left-hand side of the join.
<.> The `airline` keyspace is the right-hand side of the join.
<.> The `airlineid` field on the left-hand side must be equal to the document key on the right-hand side.
====

NOTE: Before running a query containing a join, make sure all the required indexes exist.
To check which indexes may be required, use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/advise.adoc[Index Advisor].

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/join.adoc#section_ek1_jnx_1db[ANSI JOIN Clause].

== Join Types

ANSI joins support three types of join: _inner joins_, _left outer joins_, and _right outer joins_.

=== Inner Joins

The default join is an inner join.
An inner join returns joined objects _only_ where a source object from the left-hand side of the join matches a source object from the right-hand side of the join.

To create an inner join, omit the join type, or optionally include the `INNER` keyword before the JOIN clause.

====
For example, the following query lists all the source airports and airlines that fly into San Francisco.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-inner.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-inner.jsonc[tags=extract;ellipsis]
----
====

=== Left Outer Joins

A left outer join returns joined objects using all the source objects from the left-hand side of the join, but only including source objects from the right-hand side of the join if they match.

image::left-join.png['Left outer join: the result contains all objects from the left-hand side, and only matching objects from the right-hand side']

To create a left outer join, include the `LEFT` or `LEFT OUTER` keywords before the JOIN clause.

====
For example, the following query lists all airports in the United States, and for each airport gives the first listed landmark in the same city, if any.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-left.n1ql[]
----

<.> The `airport` keyspace is on the left-hand side of the join.
<.> The `landmark` keyspace is on the right-hand side of the join.

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-left.jsonc[]
----

<.> If there is no corresponding data object on the right-hand side of the join, fields from the right-hand side are missing or null.
====

=== Right Outer Joins

A right outer join returns joined objects using all the source objects from the right-hand side of the join, but only including source objects from the left-hand side of the join if they match.

image::right-join.png['Right outer join: the result contains only matching objects from the left-hand side, and all objects from the right-hand side']

To create a right outer join, include the `RIGHT` or `RIGHT OUTER` keywords before the JOIN clause.

====
For example, the following query lists all landmarks in the United States, and for each landmark gives the first listed airport in the same city, if any.

.Context
include::partial$query-context.adoc[tag=step]

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-right.n1ql[]
----

<.> The `airport` keyspace is on the left-hand side of the join.
<.> The `landmark` keyspace is on the right-hand side of the join.

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$select/ansi-join-right.jsonc[]
----

<.> If there is no corresponding data object on the left-hand side of the join, fields from the left-hand side are missing or null.
