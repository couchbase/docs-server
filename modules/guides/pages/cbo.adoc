:description: How to use the Cost-Based Optimizer and manage optimizer statistics.

[abstract]
{description}

== Introduction

// tag::intro[]
In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, the Cost-Based Optimizer enables the Query service to create the most efficient plan to execute a query.
// end::intro[]
The Cost-Based Optimizer analyzes keyspace statistics, index statistics, and distribution statistics to select the optimal indexes and create the query execution plan.

The Cost-Based Optimizer can generate a query plan for
xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc[SELECT],
xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/update.adoc[UPDATE],
xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/delete.adoc[DELETE],
xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/merge.adoc[MERGE], and
xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/insert.adoc[INSERT INTO with SELECT] queries.

NOTE: If the Cost-Based Optimizer is unavailable or inactive, or if statistics are not available, the Query service falls back on the legacy _rules-based optimizer_ to generate the query execution plan.

== Activating the Cost-Based Optimizer

The Cost-Based Optimizer is active by default.
This section shows how to activate or deactivate the Cost-Based Optimizer for a request.
You can also activate or deactivate the Cost-Based Optimizer for a query node, or for all the query nodes in the cluster.

[tabs]
====
Query Workbench::
+
--
To activate or deactivate the Cost-Based Optimizer for a request, use the Query Run-Time Preferences window.

. Click the cog icon icon:cog[] to display the Run-Time Preferences window.

. Check or uncheck the *Use Cost-Based Optimizer* box as required.

. Choose btn:[Save Preferences] to save the preferences and return to the Query Workbench.

'''

The following setting deactivates the Cost-Based Optimizer for subsequent requests on this Query node.

The following setting activates the Cost-Based Optimizer for subsequent requests on this Query node.

image::cbo-active.png['The Run-Time Preferences dialog, with Use Cost-Based Optimizer checked']
--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
To activate or deactivate the Cost-Based Optimizer for a request, use `\SET` command with the `use_cbo` parameter.

NOTE: The parameter name must be prefixed by a hyphen.
The parameter is set to `true` by default.

'''

For example, the following code deactivates the Cost-Based Optimizer for subsequent requests on this Query node.

[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -use_cbo false;
----

The following code activates the Cost-Based Optimizer for subsequent requests on this Query node.

[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -use_cbo true;
----

== Updating Statistics

Before you can use the Cost-Based Optimizer with a query, you _must_ first gather the statistics that it needs.

include::n1ql:page$n1ql-language-reference/statistics-expressions.adoc[tags=overview]

=== Updating Statistics for Expressions

To gather statistics for specified expressions, use the `UPDATE STATISTICS` command.

====
The following example creates two indexes, gathers statistics for the index key expressions _and_ for predicate required by the query, and then runs the query.

.Create indexes
[source,sqlpp]

include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-expr.n1ql[tag=indexes]
----

.Update statistics
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-expr-predicate.n1ql[tag=update]
----

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-expr-predicate.n1ql[tag=query]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/statistics-expressions.adoc[Update Statistics for Index Expressions].

=== Updating Statistics for an Index

To gather statistics for all the index key expressions used by an index, use the `UPDATE STATISTICS` command with the `INDEX` clause.

====
For example, the following query gathers statistics for all the index expressions used by the specified index.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-index.n1ql[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/statistics-index.adoc[Update Statistics for a Single Index].

=== Updating Statistics for Multiple Indexes

To gather statistics for all the index key expressions used by multiple indexes, use the `UPDATE STATISTICS` command with the `INDEX` clause and a list of index names.

====
For example, the following query gathers statistics for the index expressions used by the specified indexes.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-indexes.n1ql[]
----

The following query gathers statistics for the index expressions used by all indexes in the specified keyspace.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-indexes-all.n1ql[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/statistics-indexes.adoc[Update Statistics for Multiple Indexes].

=== Deleting Statistics

To delete statistics, use the `UPDATE STATISTICS` command with the `DELETE` clause.

NOTE: Deleting statistics for a set of index expressions effectively turns off the Cost-Based Optimizer for queries which use predicates on those expressions.

====
For example, the following query deletes statistics for the specified index expressions.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-delete.n1ql[]
----

The following query deletes statistics for the index expressions used by all indexes in the specified keyspace.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/statistics-delete-all.n1ql[]
----
====

For more information and examples, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/statistics-delete.adoc[Delete Statistics].
