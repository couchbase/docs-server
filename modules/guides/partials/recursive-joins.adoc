== Chaining {clauses}

To chain joins, nests, and unnests, use the right-hand side of one JOIN, NEST, or UNNEST clause as the left-hand side of the next.

For example, the following query joins routes to airports by destination airport, and then nests landmarks in the same city as each airport.

[source,N1QL]
----
SELECT *
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.route AS rte -- <.>
JOIN `travel-sample`.inventory.airport AS apt -- <.>
  ON rte.destinationairport = apt.faa
NEST `travel-sample`.inventory.landmark AS lmk -- <.>
  ON apt.city = lmk.city
LIMIT 5;
----

<.> The `route` keyspace is on the left-hand side of the join.
<.> The `airport` keyspace is on the right-hand side of the join and the left-hand side of the nest.
<.> The `landmark` keyspace is on the right-hand side of the nest.
