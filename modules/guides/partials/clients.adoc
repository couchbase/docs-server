=== Couchbase Clients

// tag::body[]
Clients access data by connecting to a Couchbase cluster over the network.
The most common type of client is a Couchbase SDK, which is a full programmatic API that enables applications to take the best advantage of Couchbase.
This developer guide focuses on the most commonly-used SDKs, but full explanations and reference documentation for all SDKs is available.

The command line clients also provide a quick and streamlined interface for simple access and are suitable if you just want to access an item without writing any code.

[NOTE]
====
With some editions, the command line clients are provided as part of the installation of Couchbase Server.
Assuming a default installation, you can find them in the following location, depending on your operating system:

[horizontal]
Linux:: `/opt/couchbase/bin`
Windows:: `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin`
macOS:: `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin`

If the command line client is not provided with your installation of Couchbase Server, you must install the C SDK in order to use the command line clients.
