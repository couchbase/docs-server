=== Couchbase Clients

// tag::body[]
Clients access data by connecting to a Couchbase cluster over the network.
The most common type of client is a Couchbase SDK, which is a full programmatic API that enables applications to take the best advantage of Couchbase.
The command line clients also provide a quick and streamlined interface for simple access and are suitable if you just want to access an item without writing any code.

NOTE: The Command Line Clients are provided as part of your Couchbase Server installation in `/opt/couchbase/bin`.

For further information see:

* xref:home::sdk.adoc[SDK Clients]

* It is also possible to access document data via the Couchbase Server UI.
