You're going to need a basic working knowledge of https://www.w3schools.com/js/[Javascript^].

You're going to be running through some live examples, so will need access to a Couchbase server. 
If you don't have one available then you have a number of options:

* You can https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[sign up to Capella], the Couchbase cloud service.
* You can xref:install:install-intro.adoc[install a standalone server on your local machine].
* You can run Couchbase as a xref:install:getting-started-docker.adoc[Docker instance].

NOTE: User-defined functions require the Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
This guide assumes that you are running version 7.1 or greater.

If you need to create a cluster on your server, then follow the instructions in xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[].

You will also need the `travel-sample` bucket to work through the examples.
You will find instructions for installing the `travel-sample` in xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Install Sample Buckets]. 
 
You will also need a basic understanding of Couchbase {sqlpp}. (You can find tutorials for the query language xref:n1ql:tutorial.adoc[here]).
