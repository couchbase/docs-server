// tag::couchbase-setup[]
If you're going to be following the examples, you'll need access to a Couchbase server. 
If you don't have one available then you have a number of options:

* You can https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[sign up to Capella], the Couchbase cloud service.
* You can xref:install:install-intro.adoc[install a standalone server on your local machine].
* You can run Couchbase as a xref:install:getting-started-docker.adoc[Docker instance].

NOTE: User-defined functions require the Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
This guide assumes that you are running version 7.1 or greater.


You can also xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Install Sample Buckets] which will be helpful for running some of the examples or testing code of your own.
 
You will need a basic understanding of the N1QL language. (You can find tutorials for the query language xref:n1ql:tutorial.adoc[here]).

You'll also find instructions for getting started with the CBQ Shell in xref:tools:cbq-shell.adoc[].
