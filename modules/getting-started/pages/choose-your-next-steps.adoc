The Couchbase documentation set provides detailed information on all aspects of the platform; and this topic lists some of the important areas you can visit.

== Where to Learn More

By navigating to the sections in this topic, you can increase your knowledge in the areas you've already looked at — installation, configuration, and N1QL — and also learn about new and (in some cases) quite advanced topics; such as multi-node clustering, failover, replication, and statistical analysis.

== Installation and Configuration

Couchbase Server can be deployed and installed in several different ways, including on traditional bare-metal servers, virtual machines, containers, and in the cloud.
Take a look at the information provided in xref:install:get-started.adoc[Couchbase Server Deployment Options] to find the right deployment for you.

Couchbase Server can be configured in a variety of ways.
You can perform the configuration using the Couchbase Server Web Console, the Couchbase Command Line Interface (CLI), or with the Couchbase REST API.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for details.

Periodically, you will need to stop and start individual server nodes.
Information on doing this is provided in the section xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Couchbase Server Startup and Shutdown].

== Development

The xref:tutorials:couchbase-tutorial-student-records.adoc[] provides an introductory worked example for developers, showing how to use a software development kit with a simple database.

The xref:guides:intro.adoc[Developer Guides] section contains practical how-to guides that walk you through common Couchbase Server development tasks.

The Developer Information section contains important background detail that you will need for development using Couchbase Server.
Refer to xref:n1ql:query.adoc[Query] for details about querying Couchbase Server using the N1QL query language;
xref:fts:fts-introduction.adoc[Full Text Search] for information on text search and geospatial queries;
xref:eventing:eventing-overview.adoc[Eventing] for server-side programming using Eventing functions;
or xref:analytics:introduction.adoc[Analytics] for ad-hoc analytical queries.

== Using the Couchbase SDK

The Couchbase SDK is available for several different programming languages.
Take a look at the section xref:home:ROOT:sdk.adoc[].
You can select a language, and the page for that language provides information on installing supportive modules and libraries, and also includes code-examples to help you with development.

== Concepts and Architecture

Your hands-on progress with Couchbase Server will be greatly helped by a good _conceptual_ knowledge.
Start by looking at the xref:learn:architecture-overview.adoc[Architecture Overview], and then go from there.

== Authorization

Couchbase Server resources are protected by means of _role-based access control_ (RBAC).
This means that different _roles_ are assigned to different _users_, each role being associated with a subset of _privileges_ on one or more resources.
This makes it possible, for example, for one user to be granted read-access on a particular bucket, while another user is granted both read and write-access on the same bucket.
For a detailed explanation, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== Administration

If you are an administrator, your priority will be to learn about system setup and cluster management.
Start by reading an overview of management tasks in xref:manage:management-overview.adoc[Management Overview].

== Integration

In some cases, you may wish to integrate Couchbase Server with another, different data-repository.
For example, you might wish to continue using your current Elasticsearch database for the performance of free text searches, and extend these searches to Couchbase Server-data, so that Couchbase-documents can be retrieved.
For this to be possible, data must be shared between the repositories, and your querying coordinated between them.

See xref:connectors:intro.adoc[Connector Guides] for information about Elasticsearch and all other repositories with which you can integrate Couchbase Server.

== Additional Reference Information

When you start interacting with Couchbase in more advanced ways, make sure to explore some of the reference documentation, such as xref:rest-api:rest-intro.adoc[REST API reference] and  xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI Reference].
