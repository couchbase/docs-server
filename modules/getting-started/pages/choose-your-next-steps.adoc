The Couchbase documentation set provides detailed information on all aspects of the platform; and this topic lists some of the important areas you can visit.

== Where to Learn More

By navigating to the sections in this topic, you can increase your knowledge in the areas you've already looked at — installation, configuration, and N1QL — and also learn about new and (in some cases) quite advanced topics; such as multi-node clustering, failover, replication, and statistical analysis.

== Installation and Configuration

Couchbase Server can be deployed and installed in several different ways, including on traditional bare-metal servers, virtual machines, containers, and in the cloud.
Take a look at the information provided in xref:install:get-started.adoc[Couchbase Server Deployment Options] to find the right deployment for you.

Couchbase Server can be configured in a variety of ways.
You can perform the configuration using the Couchbase Server Web Console, the Couchbase Command Line Interface (CLI), or with the Couchbase REST API.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for details.

Periodically, you will need to stop and start individual server nodes.
Information on doing this is provided in the section xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Couchbase Server Startup and Shutdown].

== Authorization

Couchbase Server resources are protected by means of _role-based access control_ (RBAC).
This means that different _roles_ are assigned to different _users_, each role being associated with a subset of _privileges_ on one or more resources.
This makes it possible, for example, for one user to be granted read-access on a particular bucket, while another user is granted both read and write-access on the same bucket.
For a detailed explanation, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== Querying with N1QL

As you've already seen, you can query Couchbase Server manually, using the N1QL query language and the xref:tools:query-workbench.adoc[Query Workbench].
A full introduction to N1QL can be found in the section xref:java-sdk::n1ql-query.adoc[Querying with N1QL], including information on using `cbq`, which allows N1QL queries to be entered at the command line.

Additionally, N1QL queries can be specified by means of the Couchbase REST API.
For information on doing so, see the section xref:n1ql:n1ql-rest-api/index.adoc[N1QL REST API].

== Using the Couchbase SDK

The Couchbase SDK is available for several different programming languages.
Take a look at the section xref:nodejs-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK].
You can select a language, and the page for that language provides information on installing supportive modules and libraries, and also includes code-examples to get you started with development.

== Concepts and Architecture

Your hands-on progress with Couchbase Server will be greatly helped by a good _conceptual_ knowledge.
Start by looking at the xref:learn:architecture-overview.adoc[Architecture Overview], and then go from there.

== Administration

If you are an administrator, your priority will be to learn about system setup and cluster management.
Start by reading an overview of management tasks in xref:manage:management-overview.adoc[Management Overview].

== Integration

In some cases, you may wish to integrate Couchbase Server with another, different data-repository.
For example, you might wish to continue using your current Elasticsearch database for the performance of free text searches, and extend these searches to Couchbase Server-data, so that Couchbase-documents can be retrieved.
For this to be possible, data must be shared between the repositories, and your querying coordinated between them.

See xref:connectors:intro.adoc[Connector Guides] for information about Elasticsearch and all other repositories with which you can integrate Couchbase Server.

== Additional Reference Information

When you start interacting with Couchbase in more advanced ways, make sure to explore some of the reference documentation, such as xref:rest-api:rest-intro.adoc[REST API reference] and  xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI Reference].
