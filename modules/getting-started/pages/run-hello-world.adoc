= Run _Hello World!_

[abstract]
You can run queries on Couchbase Server _programmatically_, as well as manually.
A Software Development Kit (_SDK_) is provided in support of commonly used programming languages, to enable the execution of queries against Couchbase Server.
This section provides a brief introduction to this area; and also features an off-the-shelf program that you can study and run.

== Understand the Couchbase SDK

Couchbase provides a _Software Development Kit_ (SDK), to make it easy to create applications that use Couchbase Server as a data-repository.
The SDK comes in different versions, each of which supports a popular programming language.
Supported languages are _node.js_, _Java_, _.NET_, _PHP_, _Python_, _Go_, and _C_.

Using the SDK, you make N1QL queries programmatically.
For example, your application might provide a client-side UI, whereby the user selects one or more values: the application puts the values into a N1QL query-string, and passes this to a server-side program that is supported by the Couchbase SDK.
The server-side program performs a N1QL query against Couchbase Server, and returns what it retrieves to your client-side.

This section provides a simple, off-the-shelf example, which works in the way just described.
The example uses _node.js_: this may or may not be the SDK-version you choose to use in the long term; but it allows creation of a server-side program that is easy to read and run, and is therefore a good example with which to start.

== Install node.js

To install node.js, use the appropriate installer for your platform; which is available from https://nodejs.org/en/download/[nodejs.org].

== Install the Couchbase SDK for node.js

Bring up a command tool.
Then, on all platforms, against the prompt, type the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install couchbase
----

Then, on non-Windows platforms, add `node-gyp`:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install node-gyp
----

== Obtain the _Hello World!_ Example

The program you are to run is located https://github.com/couchbaselabs/helloWorldCouchbaseQueryDemo[here].
It consists of only two program files, and you can save them anywhere you want.
There are also five supportive graphics files: these must be saved in the same directory as the html file.

The file `nodeJSQueryAgent.js` is the server-side program that runs queries on Couchbase Server.
The file `helloWorldCouchbaseQuery.html` is the html client that you bring up in your browser.

We refer to this program as _Hello World!_ simply because it fits an established tradition of introductory code examples.
In fact, the words "Hello World" do not appear: instead, you see data retrieved from Couchbase Server's `travel-sample` bucket.

== Examine the Code

Before running the program, take a look at the principal elements within the code.

* helloWorldCouchbaseQuery.html *

Bring up `helloWorldCouchbaseQuery.html` in a text editor.
As you inspect the file, note that the user makes a selection on strings to be searched on, by means of radio-buttons:

[source,javascript]
----
if (selectedCountryValue == 0)
{
	selectedCountry = "United States";
} 
else 
{
	if (selectedCountryValue == 1)
	{
		selectedCountryStyle = "United Kingdom";
	}
	else
	{
		if (selectedCountryValue == 2)
		{
			selectedCountryStyle = "France";
		}
	}	
}
----

The selected value is made part of a query-string that returns all documents within the `travel-sample` bucket that provide a match:

[source,javascript]
----
var selectedQuery = 'SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE country = ' + '\"' + selectedCountryName + '\"';
----

The query-string is then itself appended to a URL, which features the hostname and port-number at which the node.js server-side program listens:

[source,javascript]
----
var nodeJsAddress = "http://localhost:8082/";
				
var nodeJsTargetURL = nodeJsAddress + '?' + "myQuery=" + selectedQuery;
----

A `getJSON` call passes the query-string to the server-side program, and receives a return-value that contains documents:

[source,javascript]
----
$.getJSON(nodeJsTargetURL, function(dataReturnedFromCouchbase) 
{
----

Returned documents, up to a specified numeric maximum (configurable, but here 10), are added to a display-string, which is then shown in the dedicated pane:

[source,javascript]
----
for (var currentKeyPosition = 0; currentKeyPosition < 10; currentKeyPosition++)
{	
					
	$.each(dataReturnedFromCouchbase[currentKeyPosition], function(key, val) 
	{	
						
		$.each(val, function(newKey, newVal)
		{			
			cbDataDisplayString = cbDataDisplayString + \"<i>\" + JSON.stringify(newKey) + "</i>" + " : " 
				+ "<b>" + JSON.stringify(newVal) + "</b>" + '</p>' + '<p>';
		});
	});

	cbDataDisplayString = cbDataDisplayString + '</br></br></br>';
}

document.getElementById('CouchbaseRetrievalsContent').innerHTML = cbDataDisplayString;
----

* nodeJsQueryAgent.js *

Now bring up `nodeJsQueryAgent.js` in your text editor.
Note that the node.js `require` construct is used to ensure that the program has access to the right supportive modules.
These include the one for Couchbase Server:

[source,javascript]
----
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');
.
.
var couchbase = require("couchbase");
----

Variables are initialized for referencing the Couchbase Server-cluster and the `travel-sample` bucket:

[source,javascript]
----
var myCluster = new couchbase.Cluster('couchbase://localhost');
var myBucket = myCluster.openBucket('travel-sample');
----

The Couchbase SDK is now used to query Couchbase Server.
A _Primary Index_ is created, to allow a N1QL query to access the data that the cluster contains.
Then, a N1QL query is made, specifying the query-string received from the html client.
The values returned are passed back to the client, as a JSON string.

[source,javascript]
----
myBucket.get(theQueryString, function(err, res)  
{
	myBucket.manager().createPrimaryIndex(function()
	{
		myBucket.query(
			couchbase.N1qlQuery.fromString(theQueryString),
			function (err, rows) 
			{
				console.log("Got rows: %j", rows);	

				response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json", 
							"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"});
				console.log("Returning...");	
				response.end(JSON.stringify(rows));
			});
		});
	});		

}).listen(8082);
----

*Note:* The node.js program is specified to listen on port 8082.
If you should happen already to have a program listening on that port, change this number to specify a port that is free.
You must change the number both here and in the client html file.

== Run the Program

In a command tool, navigate to the folder that contains the file `nodeJsQueryAgent.js`.
Then, type the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ node nodeJsQueryAgent.js
----

This starts the node.js server.
Now, bring up the file `helloWorldCouchbaseQuery.html` in a browser.
The initial appearance is as follows:

[#hello_world_initial]
image::helloWorldInitial.png[,660,align=left]

Select a string to be queried on, by means of the radio buttons in the [.uicontrol]*Airline Countries* panel.
Then, left-click on the btn:[Query Couchbase] button.
The query is executed, and the returned values are displayed in the [.uicontrol]*Travel-Sample Retrievals* panel:

[#hello_world_subsequent]
image::helloWorldSubsequent.png[,660,align=left]

The program you've just run, and the other activities provided throughout the _Getting Started_ sequence, have given you an initial indication of the rich array of features offered by Couchbase Server.
You can learn more about all aspects of the system from the Couchbase documentation-set: and in the final stage of this _Getting Started_ sequence, xref:choose-your-next-steps.adoc[Choose Your Next Steps] suggestions are provided as to locations you can visit next.
