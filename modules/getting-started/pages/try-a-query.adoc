= Run Your First N1QL Query

[abstract]
Now that you have a basic understanding of buckets and documents, you can try querying them using N1QL (pronounced "nickel"), the Couchbase Server query language.

== About N1QL

N1QL embraces the JSON document model and uses SQL-like syntax.
In N1QL, you operate on JSON documents, and the result of your operation is another JSON document.
You can run N1QL queries from the command line, using the `cbq` tool; or from the Query Workbench in the Couchbase Server Web Console.

A basic N1QL query has the following parts:

* `SELECT` — The fields of each document to return.
* `FROM` — The data bucket in which to look.
* `WHERE` — The conditions that the document must satisfy.

Here's an example of a basic N1QL query and the JSON document it returns.
The query asks for the country that is associated with the airline _Excel Airways_:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM `travel-sample` WHERE name = "Excel Airways";
----

Note that for all identifiers (bucket names) that contain a hyphen character, you need to enclose the name with backtick (`) characters.

The results:

[source,json]
----
{
    "requestID": "9e1cd084-f45e-4059-9e7a-edec30f60dd2",
    "signature": {
        "country": "json"
	},
    "results": [
        {
            "country": "United Kingdom"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
	"metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "7.42097249s",
        "executionTime": "7.420925841s",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 51
    }
}
----

The country is thus specified as `United Kingdom`.

== Try the Interactive Query Shell

[#run-cbq]
To run the interactive query shell, `cbq`, open a console window on your computer and enter the following:

[source,bash]
----
bash -c "clear && docker exec -it db sh"
----

Then, navigate to the Couchbase `bin` directory, and start `cbq`:

[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/couchbase/bin
./cbq -u Administrator -p password -engine=http://127.0.0.1:8091/
----

This displays the `cbq` shell prompt, against which you can enter N1QL commands, specifying your currently installed buckets.
For example, the following query returns the different values that are used by the documents in the `travel-sample` bucket for the `callsign` field, limiting the number of results to five:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "ae6fcd5b-e7f0-4725-ae1d-a38678c13a3e",
    "signature": {
        "callsign": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "TXW"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "atifly"
        },
        {
             "callsign": null
        },
        {
             "callsign": "LOCAIR"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "33.748019ms",
        "executionTime": "33.673901ms",
        "resultCount": 5,
        "resultSize": 215
    }
}
----

The results thus contain five `callsign` values.
A `callsign` is associated with an `airline`; and `airline` is one of the document types that the `travel-sample` bucket contains.
Others are `airport` and `hotel`.

You can also search on a type.
For example, the following query returns a maximum of one `airport` document, and lists all of the fields that it contains:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="airport" LIMIT 1;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "c49a5885-9fde-40e3-871f-699f211078cc",
    "signature": {
        "*": "*"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "travel-sample": {
                "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
                "city": "Calais",
                "country": "France",
                "faa": "CQF",
                "geo": {
                    "alt": 12,
                    "lat": 50.962097,
                    "lon": 1.954764
                },
                "icao": "LFAC",
                "id": 1254,
                "type": "airport",
                "tz": "Europe/Paris"
            }
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "16.272029ms",
        "executionTime": "16.216091ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 489
    }
}
----

The following query returns the names of (at a maximum) ten hotels that accept pets, in the city of Medway:

----
cbq> SELECT name FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel" AND city="Medway" and pets_ok=true LIMIT 10;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "b6dc75dd-4ed2-40de-83c8-9aebb3820ad8",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "name": "Medway Youth Hostel"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "45.380072ms",
        "executionTime": "45.326531ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 53
    }
}
----

The following query returns the `name` and `phone` fields for up to 10 documents for hotels in Manchester, where directions are not missing, and orders the results by name:

----
cbq> SELECT name,phone FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel" AND city="Manchester" and directions IS NOT MISSING ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "a3561cba-2377-4282-9c0f-68fc627950f6",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json",
        "phone": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    	{
            "name": "Hilton Chambers",
            "phone": "+44 161 236-4414"
    	},
        {
            "name": "Sachas Hotel",
            "phone": null
    	},
        {
            "name": "The Mitre Hotel",
            "phone": "+44 161 834-4128"
        },

    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "22.211069ms",
        "executionTime": "22.108582ms",
        "resultCount": 3,
        "resultSize": 253,
        "sortCount": 3
    }
}

== Try the Query Workbench

The Couchbase Server Web Console includes the Query Workbench, an interactive tool that lets you compose and execute N1QL queries.
To use the Query Workbench, log into the Couchbase Server Web Console, and then click [.ui]*Query*:

[#query_workbench]
image::queryWorkbench.png[,720,align=left]

The Query Workbench has three principal areas:

* [.ui]*Query Editor*: Where you will type your N1QL query
* [.ui]*Bucket Insights*: Provides information on the buckets that are currently maintained by your system.
Right now, it shows that just one exists; the bucket `travel-sample`.
* [.ui]*Query Results*: Shows query results and provides a number of options for their display.
To start with, you will use the default option, which is selectable by the btn:[JSON] button, and duly displays results in JSON-format.

Use the Query Workbench to enter the following N1QL query:

----
SELECT name FROM `travel-sample` WHERE callsign = "MILE-AIR";
----

[#first_query]
image::firstQuery.png[,660,align=left]

To execute your query, click [.ui]*Execute*.

The results now appear in the [.ui]*Query Results* panel:

[#query_results_json]
image::queryResultsJSON.png[,660,align=left]

As you can see, a single document was found to match your specified criterion — the document whose `name` value is `40-Mile Air` (which is, in fact, the document you took an initial look at during the previous step in this _Getting Started_ sequence).
