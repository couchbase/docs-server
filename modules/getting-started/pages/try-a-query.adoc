== About N1QL

N1QL embraces the JSON document model and uses SQL-like syntax.
In N1QL, you operate on JSON documents, and the result of your operation is another JSON document.
You can run N1QL queries from the command line, using the xref:cli:cbq-tool.adoc[cbq] tool, or from the Query Workbench in the Couchbase Server Web Console.

A basic N1QL query has the following parts:

* `SELECT` — The fields of each document to return.
* `FROM` — The data source in which to look.
* `WHERE` — The conditions that the document must satisfy.

In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, documents are stored in _collections_, which are stored in _scopes_, which are in turn stored in _buckets_ within a _namespace_.
The query engine needs to be aware of the full path of the collection.
The fully qualified path of a collection has the following format:

`namespace:bucket.scope.collection`

Here's an example of a basic N1QL query and the JSON document it returns.
The following query asks for the country that is associated with the airline _Excel Airways_ in the collection `pass:c[default:`travel-sample`.inventory.airline]`.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT a.country FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.airline a
WHERE a.name = "Excel Airways";
----

Note that if any part of the collection path contains a hyphen character, you need to enclose that part of the path with backtick `{backtick}` characters.
(Also note that with the introduction of scopes and collections, you no longer need to specify the `type` field in your queries.)

The results:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "country": "United Kingdom"
    }
]
----

The country is thus specified as `United Kingdom`.

To save you from having to enter the full path of the collection for every query, you can specify the _query context_ using the SDK, REST, cbq, or the Query Workbench in the Web Console.
You can then reference a collection using its relative path.
We'll cover this in more detail in the following sections.

[#run-cbq]
== Try the Interactive Query Shell

To run the interactive query shell, `cbq`, open a console window on your computer and enter the following:

[source,console]
----
bash -c "clear && docker exec -it db sh"
----

Then, navigate to the Couchbase `bin` directory, and start `cbq`:

[source,console]
----
cd /opt/couchbase/bin
./cbq -u Administrator -p password -engine=http://127.0.0.1:8091/
----

This displays the `cbq` shell prompt, against which you can enter N1QL commands, specifying your currently installed buckets.
For example, the following query returns the different values that are used by the documents in the `airline` collection for the `callsign` field, limiting the number of results to five:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT a.callsign FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.airline a LIMIT 5;
----

The results:

[source,json]
----
{
    "requestID": "cfc095c5-d23b-4a81-a4b5-990ad445559f",
    "signature": {
        "callsign": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    {
        "callsign": "MILE-AIR"
    },
    {
        "callsign": "TXW"
    },
    {
        "callsign": "atifly"
    },
    {
        "callsign": null
    },
    {
        "callsign": "LOCAIR"
    }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "3.197119ms",
        "executionTime": "3.086979ms",
        "resultCount": 5,
        "resultSize": 175,
        "serviceLoad": 3
    }
}
----

The results thus contain five `callsign` values.
A `callsign` is associated with an `airline`; and `airline` is one of the collections that the `travel-sample` bucket contains.

The following query returns the names of (at a maximum) ten hotels that accept pets, in the city of Medway:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT h.name FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel h
WHERE h.city="Medway" AND h.pets_ok=true LIMIT 10;
----

The results:

[source,json]
----
{
    "requestID": "4a6035c9-07af-43d1-be3f-0993957739f2",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    {
        "name": "Medway Youth Hostel"
    }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "16.742672ms",
        "executionTime": "16.624542ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 45,
        "serviceLoad": 3
    }
}
----

The following query returns the `name` and `phone` fields for up to 10 documents for hotels in Manchester, where directions are not missing, and orders the results by name:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT h.name, h.phone FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel h
WHERE h.city="Manchester" AND h.directions IS NOT MISSING ORDER BY h.name LIMIT 10;
----

The results:

[source,json]
----
{
    "requestID": "56781015-c66c-4ceb-9e46-36e90cfa1bae",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json",
        "phone": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    {
        "name": "Hilton Chambers",
        "phone": "+44 161 236-4414"
    },
    {
        "name": "Sachas Hotel",
        "phone": null
    },
    {
        "name": "The Mitre Hotel",
        "phone": "+44 161 834-4128"
    }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "3.541059ms",
        "executionTime": "3.407636ms",
        "resultCount": 3,
        "resultSize": 217,
        "serviceLoad": 3,
        "sortCount": 3
    }
}
----

In the cbq shell, you can set the _query context_ by setting the `query_context` parameter.
For example, the following cbq command sets the query context to `travel-sample.inventory`.
(Note that with this command, you don't need to enclose any part of the path with backticks; and the `default:` namespace is always optional.)

[source,n1ql]
----
\SET -query_context travel-sample.inventory;
----

Having set the query context, you can now reference a collection using just the collection name.

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT a.country FROM airline a WHERE a.name = "Excel Airways";
----

This query has the same result as the first example query above.

== Try the Query Workbench

The Couchbase Server Web Console includes the Query Workbench, an interactive tool that lets you compose and execute N1QL queries.
To use the Query Workbench, log into the Couchbase Server Web Console, and then click menu:Query[]:

[#query_workbench]
image::queryWorkbench.png["The Query Workbench with no query or results",720]

The Query Workbench has three principal areas:

* [.ui]*Query Editor*: Where you type your N1QL query.
* [.ui]*Explore Your Data*: Provides information on the buckets that are currently maintained by your system.
Right now, it shows that just one exists; the bucket `travel-sample`.
* [.ui]*Results*: Shows query results and provides a number of options for their display.
To start with, you will use the default option, which is selectable by the btn:[JSON] button, and duly displays results in JSON-format.

Use the Query Workbench to enter the following N1QL query:

[source,n1ql]
----
SELECT a.name FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline a WHERE a.callsign = "MILE-AIR";
----

[#first_query]
image::firstQuery.png["The Query Editor showing a query",660]

To execute your query, click btn:[Execute].

The results now appear in the [.ui]*Results* panel:

[#query_results_json]
image::queryResultsJSON.png["The Query results showing query results",660]

As you can see, a single document was found to match your specified criterion -- again, it's the document whose `name` value is `40-Mile Air`.

On the Query Workbench, you can set the _query context_ by selecting a bucket and scope from the drop-down at the top right of the Query Editor.
You can then reference a collection using just its relative path.
