= Run Your First N1QL Query

[abstract]
N1QL (pronounced "nickel") is the Couchbase Server query language.

== About N1QL

N1QL embraces the JSON document model and uses SQL-like syntax.
In N1QL, you operate on JSON documents, and the result of your operation is another JSON document.
N1QL queries can be run from the command line, using the `cbq` tool; or by means of the Query Workbench, provided by the Couchbase Web Console.

A basic N1QL query has the following parts:

* `SELECT` — The fields of each document to return.
* `FROM` — The data bucket in which to look.
* `WHERE` — The conditions that the document must satisfy.

Here's an example of a basic N1QL query and the JSON document it returns.
The query asks for the country associated with the airline _Excel Airways_ — note that for all identifiers (bucket names) that contain a hyphen character, you need to enclose the name with backtick (`) characters:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM `travel-sample` WHERE name = "Excel Airways";
----

The result is as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
    "requestID": "9e1cd084-f45e-4059-9e7a-edec30f60dd2",
    "signature": {
        "country": "json"
	},
    "results": [
        {
            "country": "United Kingdom"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
	"metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "7.42097249s",
        "executionTime": "7.420925841s",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 51
    }
}
----

The country is thus specified as `United Kingdom`.

== Making N1QL queries

After you install Couchbase Server, you can start using N1QL right away; either with the interactive query shell, `cbq`; or with the Query Workbench, which is provided by the Couchbase Web Console.

== Try the Interactive Query Shell

[#run-cbq]
To run the interactive query shell, `cbq`, bring up a console window on your machine, and enter the following against the prompt:

[source,bash]
----
$ bash -c "clear && docker exec -it db sh"
----

Then, navigate to the Couchbase `bin` directory, and start `cbq`:

[source,bash]
----
# cd /opt/couchbase/bin
# ./cbq -u Administrator -p password -engine=http://127.0.0.1:8091/
----

This displays the `cbq` shell prompt, against which you can enter N1QL commands, specifying your currently installed buckets.
For example, the following query returns the different values used by documents in the `travel-sample` bucket for the `callsign` field, limiting the number of results to 5:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5;
----

The result is as follows:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "ae6fcd5b-e7f0-4725-ae1d-a38678c13a3e",
    "signature": {
        "callsign": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "callsign": "MILE-AIR"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "TXW"
        },
        {
            "callsign": "atifly"
        },
        {
             "callsign": null
        },
        {
             "callsign": "LOCAIR"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "33.748019ms",
        "executionTime": "33.673901ms",
        "resultCount": 5,
        "resultSize": 215
    }
}
----

The result thus contains five callsign-values.
A callsign is associated with an airline; and `airline` is one of the document-types that the `travel-sample` bucket contains.
Others are `airport` and `hotel`.
You can search on a type: for example, the following query returns a maximum of one `airport` document, and lists all the fields it contains.

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="airport" LIMIT 1;
----

The query-result is as follows:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "c49a5885-9fde-40e3-871f-699f211078cc",
    "signature": {
        "*": "*"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "travel-sample": {
                "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
                "city": "Calais",
                "country": "France",
                "faa": "CQF",
                "geo": {
                    "alt": 12,
                    "lat": 50.962097,
                    "lon": 1.954764
                },
                "icao": "LFAC",
                "id": 1254,
                "type": "airport",
                "tz": "Europe/Paris"
            }
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "16.272029ms",
        "executionTime": "16.216091ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 489
    }
}
----

The following query returns the names of (at a maximum) ten hotels that accept pets, in the city of Medway.

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT name FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel" AND city="Medway" and pets_ok=true LIMIT 10;
{
    "requestID": "b6dc75dd-4ed2-40de-83c8-9aebb3820ad8",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "name": "Medway Youth Hostel"
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "45.380072ms",
        "executionTime": "45.326531ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 53
    }
}
----

The following query returns the `name` and `phone` fields for up to 10 documents for hotels in Manchester, where directions are not missing; and orders the results by name:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT name,phone FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel" AND city="Manchester" and directions IS NOT MISSING ORDER BY name LIMIT 10;
{
    "requestID": "a3561cba-2377-4282-9c0f-68fc627950f6",
    "signature": {
        "name": "json",
        "phone": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    	{
            "name": "Hilton Chambers",
            "phone": "+44 161 236-4414"
    	},
        {
            "name": "Sachas Hotel",
            "phone": null
    	},
        {
            "name": "The Mitre Hotel",
            "phone": "+44 161 834-4128"
        },

    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "22.211069ms",
        "executionTime": "22.108582ms",
        "resultCount": 3,
        "resultSize": 253,
        "sortCount": 3
    }
}

== Try the Query Workbench

The Couchbase Web Console provides a _Query Workbench_, at which you can compose and execute N1QL queries.
Left-click on the [.ui]*Query* tab, located on the horizontal control-bar, near the top of the Couchbase Web Console:

[#query_button]
image::queryButton.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the Query Workbench.

[#query_workbench]
image::queryWorkbench.png[,720,align=left]

The workbench has three principal areas, which are:

* An upper [.ui]*Query Editor* panel, which is where you will type your N1QL query.

* A [.ui]*Bucket Insights* panel, at the right.
This provides information on the buckets currently maintained by your system.
Right now, it shows that just one exists; the bucket `travel-sample`.

* A [.ui]*Query Results* panel, at the bottom-left.
This shows query-results; and provides a number of options for their display.
To start with, you will use the default option, which is selectable by the btn:[JSON] button, and duly displays results in JSON-format.

You can now use the Query Workbench to enter a N1QL query.
In the upper panel, enter the following:

[#first_query]
image::firstQuery.png[,660,align=left]

To execute your query, left-click on the btn:[Execute] button, at the upper-left:

[#execute_button]
image::executeButton.png[,100,align=left]

Query-results now appear in the [.ui]*Results* panel:

[#query_results_json]
image::queryResultsJSON.png[,660,align=left]

As you can see, a single document was found to match your specified criterion: which was the document whose `name` value is `40-Mile Air` (which is, in fact, the document you took an initial look at, during the previous stage of the _Getting Started_ sequence).
