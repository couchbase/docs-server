= Run Your First N1QL Query
:description: Now that you have a basic understanding of buckets, scopes and collections, and documents, you can try querying them using N1QL (pronounced "nickel"), the Couchbase Server query language.

== About N1QL

N1QL embraces the JSON document model and uses SQL-like syntax.
In N1QL, you operate on JSON documents, and the result of your operation is another JSON document.
You can run N1QL queries from the command line, using the xref:cli:cbq-tool.adoc[`cbq`] tool; or from the Query Workbench in the Couchbase Server Web Console.

A basic N1QL query has the following parts:

* `SELECT` — The fields of each document to return.
* `FROM` — The data bucket in which to look.
* `WHERE` — The conditions that the document must satisfy.

With the introduction of scopes and collections, querying using N1QL is simplified as you no longer need to specify the `type` field in your queries. 

The query engine needs to be aware of the full path of the collection name. This is because a collection name does not need to be unique in a bucket, but only in its own scope. A fully qualified collection name has the following format:

`namespace:bucket.scope.collection`

You can reference a collection with its relative path by setting the query_context using the SDK, REST, cbq, or the Query Workbench in the Web Console. 

Here's an example of a basic N1QL query and the JSON document it returns.

With the query_context set to `travel-sample.inventory`, the following query asks for the country that is associated with the airline _Excel Airways_:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT a.country FROM airline a WHERE a.name = "Excel Airways";
----

[#travel_sample_query_context]
image::travelSampleQueryContext.png[,720,align=left]

Note that for all identifiers that contain a hyphen character, you need to enclose the name with backtick (`) characters.

The results:

[source,json]
----
[
    {
        "country": "United Kingdom"
    }
]
----

The country is thus specified as `United Kingdom`.


== Try the Interactive Query Shell

[#run-cbq]
To run the interactive query shell, `cbq`, open a console window on your computer and enter the following:

[source,bash]
----
bash -c "clear && docker exec -it db sh"
----

Then, navigate to the Couchbase `bin` directory, and start `cbq`:

[source,bash]
----
cd /opt/couchbase/bin
./cbq -u Administrator -p password -engine=http://127.0.0.1:8091/
----

This displays the `cbq` shell prompt, against which you can enter N1QL commands, specifying your currently installed buckets.
For example, the following query returns the different values that are used by the documents in the `airport` collection for the `callsign` field, limiting the number of results to five:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT a.callsign FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.airport  a LIMIT 5;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "cfc095c5-d23b-4a81-a4b5-990ad445559f",
    "signature": {
        "callsign": "json"
    },
    "results": [
    {
        "callsign": "MILE-AIR"
    },
    {
        "callsign": "TXW"
    },
    {
        "callsign": "atifly"
    },
    {
        "callsign": null
    },
    {
        "callsign": "LOCAIR"
    }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "3.197119ms",
        "executionTime": "3.086979ms",
        "resultCount": 5,
        "resultSize": 175,
        "serviceLoad": 3
    }
}
----

The results thus contain five `callsign` values.
A `callsign` is associated with an `airline`; and `airline` is one of the collections that the `travel-sample` bucket contains.

////
You can also search on a type.
For example, the following query returns a maximum of one `airport` document, and lists all of the fields that it contains:

[source,sql]
----
cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="airport" LIMIT 1;
----

The results:

[source,sql]
----
{
    "requestID": "c49a5885-9fde-40e3-871f-699f211078cc",
    "signature": {
        "*": "*"
    },
    "results": [
        {
            "travel-sample": {
                "airportname": "Calais Dunkerque",
                "city": "Calais",
                "country": "France",
                "faa": "CQF",
                "geo": {
                    "alt": 12,
                    "lat": 50.962097,
                    "lon": 1.954764
                },
                "icao": "LFAC",
                "id": 1254,
                "type": "airport",
                "tz": "Europe/Paris"
            }
        }
    ],
    "status": "success",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "16.272029ms",
        "executionTime": "16.216091ms",
        "resultCount": 1,
        "resultSize": 489
    }
}

The following query returns the names of (at a maximum) ten hotels that accept pets, in the city of Medway:

----
cbq> SELECT h.name FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel h WHERE h.city="Medway" and h.pets_ok=true LIMIT 10;
----

The results:

[source,sql]

{
    "requestID": "4a6035c9-07af-43d1-be3f-0993957739f2",
    "signature": {

The following query returns the `name` and `phone` fields for up to 10 documents for hotels in Manchester, where directions are not missing, and orders the results by name:

----
cbq> SELECT h.name,h.phone FROM default:`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel h WHERE h.city="Manchester" and h.directions IS NOT MISSING ORDER BY h.name LIMIT 10;

        "name": "Sachas Hotel",
        "phone": null

== Try the Query Workbench

The Couchbase Server Web Console includes the Query Workbench, an interactive tool that lets you compose and execute N1QL queries.
To use the Query Workbench, log into the Couchbase Server Web Console, and then click [.ui]*Query*:

[#query_workbench]
image::queryWorkbench.png[,720,align=left]

The Query Workbench has three principal areas:

* [.ui]*Query Editor*: Where you will type your N1QL query
* [.ui]*Data Insights*: Provides information on the buckets that are currently maintained by your system.
Right now, it shows that just one exists; the bucket `travel-sample`.
* [.ui]*Query Results*: Shows query results and provides a number of options for their display.
To start with, you will use the default option, which is selectable by the btn:[JSON] button, and duly displays results in JSON-format.

Before running a query, set the query_context to reference a collection with its relative path. On the Query Workbench, set the query_context by selecting the bucket and scope from the drop-down.

[#travel_sample_query_context]
image::travelSampleQueryContext.png[,720,align=left]

Use the Query Workbench to enter the following N1QL query:

----
SELECT a.name FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline a WHERE a.callsign = "MILE-AIR";
----

[#first_query]
image::firstQuery.png[,660,align=left]

To execute your query, click [.ui]*Execute*.

The results now appear in the [.ui]*Query Results* panel:

[#query_results_json]
image::queryResultsJSON.png[,660,align=left]

As you can see, a single document was found to match your specified criterion — the document whose `name` value is `40-Mile Air` (which is, in fact, the document you took an initial look at during the previous step in this _Getting Started_ sequence).
