[abstract]
Using the Couchbase .NET SDK in an ASP.NET Core application to create new database records in Couchbase and look them up. 

== Prerequisite: Run Couchbase Server

1. Couchbase Server 6.5 is already running.

** An empty bucket named "default" has been created.

** Both a primary index and an adaptive index have been created and built on the default bucket.

** If you still need to perform these tasks please use the following:

*** xref:quickstart-docker-image-manual.adoc[10-minute Couchbase Docker Container Configuration]
//*** */ or run the following command(s) to run an automatically-configured CE docker image
//<commands>

2. Visual Studio is installed. This tutorial uses link:https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/[Visual Studio] 2019 16.5.

3. link:https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core[.NET Core Runtime] is installed. This tutorial uses .NET Core 3.1

4. A tool to make HTTP requests (e.g. link:https://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] or link:https://www.postman.com/[Postman]).

== Step 1: Start a New Project in Visual Studio

Open Visual Studio 2019 and create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project.

Select the API template.

Install the latest link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions[Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection] package from NuGet. This will install both the Couchbase .NET SDK and a Dependency Injection extension for ASP.NET Core.

[Note]
====
This open-source project is part of Couchbase Labs, and is not commercially supported by Couchbase, Inc.
====

You can do this via Visual Studio's Package Manager Console like so:

[source,Powershell]
----
Install-Package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection -Version 2.0.2
----

[Note]
====
Alternatively, you can use the NuGet UI by right-clicking "Dependencies" in Solution Explore and then "Manage NuGet Packages".
====

== Step 2: ASP.NET Core Configuration

There are two steps to configure your new ASP.NET Core application.

First, add a "Couchbase" section to the appsettings.json file. If you've followed along with the xref:quickstart-docker-image-manual.adoc[10-minute Couchbase Docker Container Configuration], then edit your appsettings.json file to add a Couchbase section as follows:

[source,JavaScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/appsettings.json[]
----

The next step is to setup Couchbase in Startup.cs.

To do this, first add `services.AddCouchbase(Configuration.GetSection("Couchbase"));` to the `ConfigureServices` method. Make sure to close the connection as well. You can do this in the `Configure` method by adding an `IHostApplicationLifetime` parameter. Here is the complete Startup.cs:

[source,C#]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/Startup.cs[]
----
<1> Add Couchbase service to ASP.NET Core
<2> Dispose of Couchbase on ASP.NET Core shutdown

At this point, your ASP.NET Core application is now configured to use Couchbase.

== Step 3: Create new documents

Start by creating a simple "model" class to represent a user. (Right Click on the project -> Add New Item -> Class -> User.cs)

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/User.cs[tag=user]
----

Let's create two controller actions. These will correspond to two API endpoints: one will create a document and one will query a document.

Replace the `WeatherForecastController` with a `UserController`. Create a constructor in that controller which has an `IBucketProvider` parameter. Use the bucketProvider to get an instance of a Couchbase bucket: `_bucket = bucketProvider.GetBucket("default")`.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/Controllers/UserController.cs[tag=ctor]
----

Use this bucket object to insert plain C# objects into Couchbase. They will be serialized into JSON and stored with a key: `_bucket.Insert(key, user);`. Create an `InsertData` POST method in `UserController` like so:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/Controllers/UserController.cs[tag=insert]
----

Compile and run your ASP.NET Core program locally with CTRL+F5. Use cURL or Postman or the HTTP tool of your choice to create three POSTs with JSON content to the specified route. The body of the posts should look something like these:

[source,JavaScript]
----
// first POST
{
    "firstName" : "Major",
    "lastName" : "Tom",
    "email" : "major.tom@acme.com",
    "tagLine" : "Send me up a drink"
}

// second POST
{
    "email": "perry.mason@acme.com",
    "firstName": "Perry",
    "lastName": "Mason",
    "tagLine": "Who can we get on the case?"
}
 
// third POST
{
    "email": "jerry.wasaracecardriver@acme.com",
    "firstName": "Jerry",
    "lastName": "Wasaracecardriver",
    "tagLine": "el sob number one"
}
----

And example of a cURL command to make this request would be:

[source,PowerShell]
----
curl --location --request POST 'https://localhost:44316/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName" : "Major",
    "lastName" : "Tom",
    "email" : "major.tom@acme.com",
    "tagLine" : "Send me up a drink"
}'
----

[Note]
====
If you're using Postman, you can copy and paste the above cURL command into Postman. (File->Import->Paste Raw Text)
====

When the request is successful, the response will contain the generated ID:

[source]
----
Inserted user with ID: d28a19d4-0c37-447f-b0c0-66a7f2af3c97
----

Now there are three documents in the default bucket. Next, let's query them back out.

== Step 4: Query the documents

Open the Query Workbench in the Couchbase UI. Enter a query to select everything from the default bucket:

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT d.*
FROM default d
----

You should see the inserted documents in the results:

[source,JavaScript]
----
[
  {
    "email": "perry.mason@acme.com",
    "firstName": "Perry",
    "lastName": "Mason",
    "tagLine": "Who can we get on the case?",
    "type": "user"
  },
  {
    "email": "major.tom@acme.com",
    "firstName": "Major",
    "lastName": "Tom",
    "tagLine": "Send me up a drink",
    "type": "user"
  },
  {
    "email": "jerry.wasaracecardriver@acme.com",
    "firstName": "Jerry",
    "lastName": "Wasaracecardriver",
    "tagLine": "el sob number one",
    "type": "user"
  }
]
----

Next, create a second controller action called `GetUserByEmail` in UserController.cs. This will be for an API endpoint to retrieve documents, given an email address, using a query like:

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT d.*
FROM default d
WHERE d.email = "major.tom@acme.com"
----

To execute a query in .NET, start by creating a query string with a named parameter for email: `var n1ql = "SELECT d.* FROM default d WHERE d.email = $email";`.

Use the string with `QueryRequest.Create(...)` to create a query object. Parameters and other settings can be supplied using this query object. Finally, use the `_bucket` object to execute the query.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/quickstart-aspnetcore31-cb65/Controllers/UserController.cs[tag=getdata]
----

Compile and run your ASP.NET Core program locally with CTRL+F5. Use cURL or Postman or the HTTP tool of your choice to create a GET with a querystring variable of `email` with the specified email address. Example of a cURL request:

[source,PowerShell]
----
curl --location --request GET 'https://localhost:44316/?email=major.tom@acme.com'
----

[Note]
====
Since this is a GET, you can make this request from a web browser instead.
====

The body of a successful response should look something like this:

[source,JavaScript]
----
[
    {
        "firstName" : "Major",
        "lastName" : "Tom",
        "email" : "major.tom@acme.com",
        "tagLine" : "Send me up a drink"
    }
]
----

== Done

If you've written SQL before, the N1QL queries in this example should look familiar. Instead of querying a table, `default` is the name of a bucket.
