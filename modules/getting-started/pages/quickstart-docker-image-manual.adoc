= Couchbase Server CE Docker Container - Example Manual Configuration
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

[abstract]
For the QuickStart exercises, a Couchbase CE 6.5 docker container can be configured with minimal system footprint using the following steps.

Alternatively, a completely automated configuration can be run instead by following <link to automated instructions>. 


== Prerequisite: Download and Install Docker

If Docker is not already running, go to the https://www.docker.com/get-docker[Docker installation page^] and follow the instructions.


== Step 1: Run the Couchbase Server CE container image, and load the WebUI
Open a console window on your computer and enter the following command.  Docker will pull the image from Docker Hub and run it:

----
docker run -d --name ce-6.5 -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 couchbase:community-6.5.0
----

Open the Couchbase webUI by navigating your web browser to this address:
http://localhost:8091

== Step 2: Configure Couchbase as a minimal single node cluster

Click the "Setup New Cluster" button.

<screen cap of 'New Cluster' page>

Enter any cluster name and password.  Click "Next.."

Checking the "I accept..." box to indicate your acceptance of the terms and conditions.  Click the "Finish With Defaults" button. You will be presented with a blank Dashboard screen.

Click "Settings" in the left-hand navigation bar. Under "Memory Quotas" set all to 256 MB.  Click "Save", and then "Confirm".

== Step 3: Create a new data bucket

Click "Buckets" in the left-hand navigation bar, then "ADD BUCKET" in the upper right corner.

Enter "default" for the Name, and 100 MB for the Memory Quota.

Click the "Add Bucket" button.

NOTE: You can ignore the "At least two servers..." warning. 


== Step 4: Create secondary indexes

The CREATE INDEX statement is used for creating secondary indexes.  We will use the query workbench to create 2 indexes to facilitate our exercises: 

* one "primary index" to make initial queries easy to execute
* one "adaptive index" to help with filtered queries 

Click "Query" in the left-hand navigation bar.

Paste both following statements into the Query Editor and click "Execute":

----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX on default;
CREATE INDEX adaptive_default ON default(DISTINCT PAIRS(self));
----

<screen cap of query workbench, post-execute>

Click "Indexes" in the left-hand navigation bar to see the indexes. 

== Done!  

You can close out of the WebUI.
