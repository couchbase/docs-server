:description: First-time users can get Couchbase Server running simply and rapidly by using Docker.

[abstract]
{description}
Once you install Docker, you can use a single command to download and install a pre-configured version of Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition on your computer.

NOTE: The Docker container image that is used in this topic is meant to set up a 'sandbox' version of Couchbase Server.
It's based on the Enterprise Edition and contains scripts that automatically configure several Couchbase components during installation.
Although this particular image works great for a demo, it is not meant for production.
For information about using containers to run Couchbase Server in production, see the xref:cloud:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc[Cloud and Container Deployment Overview].

== Install Couchbase Server

Prerequisite::
Ensure that you have Docker set up on your computer before proceeding to install Couchbase Server. Refer to the https://www.docker.com/get-docker[Docker documentation^] for instructions to set up Docker.


NOTE: You may need administrative or root privileges on your computer to complete the installation.

Open a console window on your computer and enter the following command:

----
docker run -t --name db -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 couchbase/server:enterprise-7.0.0
----

When you run the command, Docker downloads and installs Couchbase Server. You should see the following message once Couchbase Server is started in a Docker virtual environment:

----
Starting Couchbase Server -- Web UI available at http://<ip>:8091
and logs available in /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs
----

From this point onward, don't close the console while you're using Couchbase Server; this terminates both Docker and Couchbase Server.

You must now configure the server and load the `travel-sample` dataset.

== Configure Couchbase Server 

For simplicity when getting started, we will provision a single node cluster from the Web Console. The Web console can be accessed over the network at http://<machine-ip-address>:8091/ or http://<machine-hostname>:8091/. It can be accessed from the machine on which Couchbase Server was installed at http://localhost:8091.

Once you have connected, the Welcome screen appears:

Click *Setup New Cluster* and provide a name for your cluster. For the purpose of getting started, set the full administrator credentials to "Administrator" and "password".

[#console_new_cluster_screen]

Accept the Terms and Conditions and click *Finish with Defaults* to complete configuration with default values. You can also choose to *Configure Disk, Memory, Services* to select only a subset of services for the purpose of this getting started. 

[#console_configure_services_screen]

When you have finished entering your configuration-details, click the *Save & Finish* button, at the lower right. This configures the server accordingly, and brings up the Couchbase Web Console Dashboard, for the first time.

== Load the Sample Dataset

You must load the sample `travel-sample` dataset to work through the rest of the geting started topics.

On the initial screen of the Web Console Dashboard, click the link *Sample Buckets*. 

On the *Sample Buckets* screen, select the checkbox for `travel-sample` and then click *Load Sample*. The `travel-sample` dataset is now displayed under *Installed Samples*.

This is the procedure you will certainly use in production; as well as for testing different configurations.
The available options include use of the Couchbase Server Web Console, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase Command Line Interface.
