= Do a Quick Install

[abstract]
First-time users can get Couchbase Server running simply and rapidly by using _Docker_.
After it has been downloaded, a single command is all you need; to obtain, install, configure, and run Couchbase Server.

[#initialize-cluster-web-console]
== Download Docker

Docker is a freely available application that lets you install a fully configured Couchbase Server with a single command.
To download Docker, go to the https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform[Docker^] installation page.
This displays an [.ui]*Install the Platform* pane:

[#docker_download_page]
image::docker-download-page.png[,560,align=left]

Pick the version of Docker that is appropriate for your platform: Mac, Windows, or Linux.
Then, left-click on the corresponding [.ui]*Download* or btn:[Install] button:

* On *Mac*, the `Docker.dmg` package is now downloaded.
When the download has completed, open the package by double left-clicking on the icon.
An interactive screen is then displayed: follow the instruction it provides, and drag-and-drop Docker into your Applications folder.

* On *Windows*, when you left-click on the [.ui]*Download*, button, a `.msi` file is downloaded.
When the download has completed, open the file, and proceed as directed with installation.

* On *Linux*, a list of Docker-supported distributions is displayed.
From this list, pick the entry that corresponds to your current platform.
You now see an instruction-page, provided by Docker.
Follow these instructions, to perform installation.

*Note:* For installation, you may need  supervisor privileges on your machine (obtained, for example, by means of the `sudo` command, on MacOS and Linux).

== Run Docker, to Install Couchbase Server

First, bring up an interactive console on your screen.
Then, against the console-prompt, enter the following command:

 $ docker run -t --name db -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase/server:sandbox

Docker now obtains, downloads, installs, and configures Couchbase Server.
During the download process, you see output like the following, in your console:

 $ docker run -t --name db -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase/server:sandbox

Eventually, Couchbase Server is started, in a Docker virtual environment:

When start-up is thus concluded, Couchbase Server is running in a default configuration, and can be accessed.

*Note:* From this point, while you are using Couchbase Server, don't close the console; since this terminates both Docker and Couchbase Server.

== Next

You can now proceed directly to the next stage of the _Getting Started_ sequence, and xref:look-at-the-results.adoc[Look at the Results] of your installation and configuration, using the _Couchbase Web Console_.

== Other Destinations

At the end of the _Getting Started_ sequence, you'll find a comprehensive list of links; which allow you to investigate in greater detail all the subjects introduced on this page.
However, if you don't want to wait, you can learn more about Couchbase Server installation and configuration right away, by visiting the following locations:

* xref:install:install-intro.adoc[Installing On-Premises] explains how to install Couchbase Server directly onto your host, without the use of Docker or any other virtual environment.
This kind of direct install is the one you will certainly use for production-deployments, and possibly for additional development and testing activities.

* xref:install:init-setup.adoc[Initialize the Cluster] provides a detailed explanation of how to custom-configure Couchbase Server at start-up.
This is the procedure you will certainly use in production; as well as for testing different configurations.
The available options include use of the Couchbase Web Console UI, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase Command Line Interface.

* xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Couchbase Server Startup and Shutdown] tells you how to start and stop the server, using commands specific to your underlying platform.

Optionally, when you have inspected these other destinations, you can return to the current page, and continue working through the _Getting Started_ sequence.
