:description: First-time users can get Couchbase Server running simply and rapidly by using Docker.

[abstract]
{description}
Once you install Docker, you can use a single command to download and install a pre-configured version of Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition on your computer.

NOTE: The Docker container image that is used in this topic is meant to set up a 'sandbox' version of Couchbase Server.
It's based on the Enterprise Edition and contains scripts that automatically configure several Couchbase components during installation.
Although this particular image works great for a demo, it is not meant for production.
For information about using containers to run Couchbase Server in production, see the xref:cloud:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc[Cloud and Container Deployment Overview].

== Install Couchbase Server

Prerequisite::
Ensure that you have Docker set up on your computer before proceeding to install Couchbase Server. Refer to the https://www.docker.com/get-docker[Docker documentation^] for instructions to set up Docker.


NOTE: You may need administrative or root privileges on your computer to complete the installation.

Open a console window on your computer and enter the following command:

[source,console]
----
docker run -t --name db -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 couchbase/server:enterprise-7.1.0
----

When you run the command, Docker downloads and installs Couchbase Server. You should see the following message once Couchbase Server is started in a Docker virtual environment:

----
Starting Couchbase Server -- Web UI available at http://<ip>:8091
and logs available in /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs
----

From this point onward, don't close the console while you're using Couchbase Server; this terminates both Docker and Couchbase Server.

You must now configure the server and load the `travel-sample` dataset.

== Configure Couchbase Server 

For simplicity when getting started, we will provision a single node cluster from the Web Console. The Web console can be accessed over the network at http://<machine-ip-address>:8091/ or http://<machine-hostname>:8091/. It can be accessed from the machine on which Couchbase Server was installed at http://localhost:8091.

Once you have connected, the Welcome screen appears:

[#console_setup_screen]

Click btn:[Setup New Cluster] and provide a name for your cluster.
For the purpose of getting started, set the full administrator credentials to `Administrator` and `password`.

[#console_new_cluster_screen]
image::consoleNewCluster.png["The Couchbase > New Cluster dialog",397]

Accept the Terms and Conditions and click btn:[Finish with Defaults] to complete configuration with default values.
You can also choose to btn:[Configure Disk, Memory, Services] to select only a subset of services for the purpose of this getting started. 

[#console_configure_services_screen]
image::consoleConfigureServices.png["The Couchbase > New Cluster > Configure dialog",399]

When you have finished entering your configuration-details, click the btn:[Save & Finish] button, at the lower right.
This configures the server accordingly, and brings up the Couchbase Web Console Dashboard, for the first time.

== Load the Sample Dataset

You must load the sample `travel-sample` dataset to work through the rest of the _Getting Started_ topics.

On the initial screen of the Web Console Dashboard, click the link *Sample Buckets*. 

On the *Sample Buckets* screen, select the checkbox for `travel-sample` and then click *Load Sample*. The `travel-sample` dataset is now displayed under *Installed Samples*.

* xref:install:install-intro.adoc[Installing the Couchbase Server Cluster]: Explains how to install Couchbase Server directly onto your host, without the use of Docker or any other virtual environment.
This kind of direct install is very common for production-deployments, as well as development and testing activities.

* xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster]: Provides a detailed explanation of how to provision a Couchbase Server-node, and thereby create a one-node Couchbase cluster.
This is the procedure you will certainly use in production; as well as for testing different configurations.
The available options include use of the Couchbase Server Web Console, the Couchbase REST API, and the Couchbase Command Line Interface.

* xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Couchbase Server Startup and Shutdown]: Explains how to start and stop the server using the commands that are specific to your underlying platform.
