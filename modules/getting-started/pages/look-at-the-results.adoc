= Explore the Server Configuration

[abstract]
Once you have Couchbase Server running, you can log into the _Couchbase Server Web Console_, and start to examine the different features that it provides.
These features include an interface for inspecting Couchbase _documents_, organized within _buckets_.

== Access the Console and Log In

The default address for the Couchbase Server Web Console (whether it is running in a Docker virtual environment, or directly on your platform) is `localhost:8091`.
Enter the address into the address bar of a xref:install:install-platforms.adoc#supported-browsers[supported Web browser], and hit return.
The Couchbase Server log-in screen is displayed:

[#console_login]
image::consoleLogin.png[,320,align=left]

The Docker image that you installed comes pre-configured with a default username and password:

* Username: `Administrator`
* Password: `password`

Type these credentials into the appropriate fields and click [.ui]*Sign In*.

== Examine the Cluster Dashboard

Every time you log into the Web Console, you are brought to the [.ui]*Cluster Dashboard*:

[#cluster_overview]
image::ClusterOverview.png[,720,align=left]

The [.ui]*Cluster Dashboard* provides a graphical summary of the current state of your Couchbase cluster.
The term _cluster_ might seem unexpected at this point, since you are only running a single instance of Couchbase Server; but nevertheless, it counts as a cluster of one.

All of the values that are displayed on this screen were automatically configured by the sandbox container image during installation.
In production, you will specify these values individually according to your needs.

Notice the information panel at the very bottom.
This shows that you have a single active bucket on the system â€” _bucket_ meaning a logical group of data-items.
Taking a closer look at this bucket will give you some idea of how Couchbase stores data, and prepare you to make your first data-queries.

== Examine Your Bucket and Its Documents

Click [.ui]*Buckets* in the left-hand navigation bar to bring up the [.ui]*Buckets* screen.

The [.ui]*Buckets* screen shows that you have a single active bucket on the system (_bucket_ meaning a logical group of data-items).
Taking a closer look at this bucket will give you some idea of how Couchbase stores data, and prepare you to make your first data-queries:

[#travel_sample_bucket_screen_initial]
image::travelSampleBucketScreenInitial.png[,720,align=left]

The name of the single bucket (`travel-sample`) appears towards the left of the single row.
Additional information is provided in columns, across the row.

Click [.ui]*Documents*, which is located towards the right of the `travel-sample` row, to go to the [.ui]*Documents* screen.

The [.ui]*Documents* screen lets you inspect the individual documents that are contained within the bucket:

[#travel_sample_bucket_screen]
image::travelSampleBucketScreen.png[,720,align=left]

The [.ui]*Documents* screen shows, in a succession of page-views, the documents that are contained within the bucket.
The following document retrieval controls are provided:

* *Bucket*: A drop-down menu that displays the name of the bucket whose documents are currently being viewed.
You can use the drop-down menu to select other available buckets.
* *Limit*: The maximum number of rows (documents) to retrieve and display at once.
* *Offset*: The number of documents in the entire set of the current bucket that should be skipped, before display begins.
Notice that when you click [.ui]*Next Batch >*, the [.ui]*Offset* increases by the same value that is specified in [.ui]*Limit*.
* *Document ID*: Accepts the ID of a specific document.
Leave this field blank to retrieve documents based on *Limit* and *Offset*.
* *Where*: Accepts a _N1QL_ query â€” specifically a WHERE clause â€” which determines the subset of documents to be displayed.
(You will learn more about N1QL in a later step of this _Getting Started_ sequence.)

In the results, each document is represented by an individual row that contains its ID and a summary of its contents.
You can switch between two views: [.ui]*simple* and [.ui]*spreadsheet*.
In the [.ui]*spreadsheet* view, you can edit the document fields directly, since each key has its own column in which the corresponding value for each document is provided, row by row.

The following buttons appear on the left side of each row:

* *Edit document as JSON*: Click this button to bring up the [.ui]*Edit Document* dialog, which allows you to make direct edits to the document:
+
image::editDocumentDialog.png[,480,align=left]
+
The document consists of a series of _key-value_ pairs (or, as they are sometimes expressed, _name-value_ pairs).
You can make modifications to key-values directly in this editor.
As will be demonstrated later, Couchbase Server allows you to search for keys, and return the corresponding values, by means of a _query_.
For example, here, if you searched on the name `country`, you would return the value `United States`; if on the name `icao`, the value `MLA`.
+
If you make changes in the [.ui]*Edit Document* dialog, click [.ui]*Save* to save your changes.
If you want to create a new document based on an existing document, you can click the *Make a copy of this document* button (described next).
If you want to create an entirely new document, you can click the btn:[ADD DOCUMENT] button in the upper-right.
+
Note that Couchbase Web Console supports the editing of documents that are up to 10 MB in size (although documents on Couchbase Server can be up to 20 MB in size).

* *Make a copy of this document*: Click this button to bring up the [.ui]*Save As* dialog, which allows you to create a new document based on the existing one:
+
[#save_as_dialog]
image::saveAsDialog.png[,280,align=left]
+
Either click the btn:[Save] button to save the copy under the placeholder name that is provided, or edit the placeholder-name before saving.
+

* *Delete this document*: Click this button to delete the document.
* *Save changes to document*: If you make changes in the [.ui]*spreadsheet* view, this button becomes active for the current row.
Click it to save your changes to the document.

Note that if you are using the [.ui]*spreadsheet* view, any unsaved changes that you have made to document key-values will be saved in the copied document and not the original, much like the behavior of traditional text editing software.

To view successive sets of documents, use the [.ui]*Next Batch >* and [.ui]*< Prev Batch* buttons.

== Next

Now that you have a basic familiarity with the way in which Couchbase Server organizes data, you can start to define and execute queries to return specific data subsets.
You'll experiment with this in the next section: xref:try-a-query.adoc[Run Your First N1QL Query].
