== PCRE LICENCE

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England.

The source is available at ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/[^].
