== Beta Release

// tag::admonition[]
[CAUTION]
--
This is a pre-release (Beta) version of Couchbase Server 6.5 and is intended for development purposes only.
We consider Beta releases to have some rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release. 

This release is not supported in production, and cannot be upgraded to any other release, including the GA release.
Ensure that you record any configurations that you might want to re-create with future releases.

No Enterprise Support is provided for pre-release (Developer Preview and Beta) versions of the software.
