= Query Settings

[abstract]
Description of Service-level query settings and methods to set and use them.

The Couchbase Query Service is made of two components, Service-level query settings and Request-level parameters, which are set, used, and behave differently:

.Comparison of Query Settings and Parameters
[#table_hkz_dlp_j1b,cols="216,145,145,145,230"]
|===
|  | Setting Per | Set By | Set On | Set Via

| *Service-level Query Settings*
| Service Node
| The administrator at the system level
| Server side
| curl statements

| *Request-level Parameters*
| Request (statement)
| Each user
| Client side
| cbq command-line parameters, curl or client programming
|===

NOTE: The Request-level Parameters overwrite their Service-level Query Setting equivalents.

NOTE: The Service-level settings will dictate the upper-bound values of the Request-level parameters.
For example, if the Service-level `timeout` is set to 500, then the Request-level parameter cannot be set to 501 or any value higher.

To set a Service-level query setting, while the Query Service is running, use the /admin/settings REST API endpoint with a curl statement.

To see a list of the current Query Settings, enter:

----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -u user:pword
----

This will output to the screen the entire list of service-level query settings:

----
{"completed-limit":7000,"completed-threshold":0,"controls":false,"cpuprofile":"","debug":false,"keep-alive-length":16384,"loglevel":"INFO","max-parallelism":1,"memprofile":"","pipeline-batch":16,"pipeline-cap":512,"prepared-limit":16384,"pretty":false,"profile":"off","request-size-cap":67108864,"scan-cap":512,"servicers":32,"timeout":0}
----

To output to a file for editing multiple settings at a single time, add the [.var]`-o filename` option, for example:

----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -u user:pword -o settings.txt
----

To instantly change one setting, see details of each setting in the below <<table_kgw_2lr_hz,Service-Level Query Settings>> table.

== Service-Level Query Settings

Below is a description of each query setting along with examples.
While `cbq`  is a sandbox to test code on your local machine, your production query settings are set with the  `curl`  commands on your server.
These are the only two ways to set these settings, and not all settings can be set by `cbq`.

.Service-Level Query Settings
[#table_kgw_2lr_hz,cols="185,100,130,260,341,571"]
|===
| Setting | Type | Default 3+| Description

| `completed-limit`
| int
| `4000`
3+a|
Maximum number of completed requests.
As new completed requests are added, old ones are removed.

Increase this when the completed request keyspace is not big enough to track the slow requests, such as when customers want a larger sample of slow requests.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"completed-limit":7000}' -u user:pword
----

| `completed-threshold`
| int
| `1000`
3+a|
Cache completed query lasting longer than this many milliseconds.

Specify 0 to track all requests independent of duration.

Specify any negative number to track none.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"completed-threshold":7000}' -u user:pword
----

| `controls`
| bool
| `false`
3+a|
[Optional] Specifies if there should be a controls section returned with the request results.

When set to `true`, the query response document includes a controls section with runtime information provided along with the request, such as positional and named parameters or settings.

NOTE: If the request qualifies for caching, these values will also be cached in the `completed_requests` system keyspace.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -controls true;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"controls":true}' -u user:pword
----

| `cpuprofile`
| string
| `""`
3+a|
The absolute path and filename to write the CPU profile to a local file.

The output file includes a controls section and performance measurements, such as memory allocation and garbage collection, to pinpoint bottlenecks and ways to improve your code execution.

To stop `cpuprofile`, run with the empty setting of `""`.

NOTE: If `cpuprofile` is left running too long, it can slow the system down as its file size increases.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"cpuprofile":"/tmp/info.txt"}' -u user:pword
----

// Do we want to add this engineering method?
// <note>For another way to set this, see the Capturing Profiling Info
// section.</note>

| `debug`
| bool
| `false`
3+a|
Use debug mode.

When set to `true`, extra logging is provided.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"debug":true}' -u user:pword
----

| `keep-alive-length`
| int
| `16384`
3+a|
Maximum size of buffered result.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"keep-alive-length":7000}' -u user:pword
----

.9+| `loglevel`
.9+| string
.9+| `"INFO"`
3+| Log level used in the logger.
All values in descending order of data:

a|
* DEBUG
| For developers
| Writes everything.

a|
* TRACE
| For developers
| Less info than debug.

a|
* INFO
| For admin & customers
| Lists warnings & errors.

a|
* WARN
| For admin
| Only abnormal items.

a|
* ERROR
| For admin
| Only errors to be fixed.

a|
* SEVERE
| For admin
| Major items, like crashes.

a|
* NONE
| 
| Doesn't write anything.

3+a|
.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"loglevel":"DEBUG"}' -u user:pword
----

| `max-parallelism`
| int
| `1`
3+a|
[Optional] Specifies the maximum parallelism for the query.

A zero or negative value means the number of logical CPUs will be used as the parallelism for the query.

A server-wide `max_parallelism` parameter defaults to "1" and will be used when a request does not include this parameter.

If a request includes `max_parallelism`, it will be capped by the server `max_parallelism`.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -max-parallelism 3;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"max-parallelism":0}' -u user:pword
----

| `memprofile`
| string
| `""`
3+a|
Filename to write the diagnostic memory usage log.

To stop `memprofile`, run with the empty setting of `""`.

NOTE: If `memprofile` is left running too long, it can slow the system down as its file size increases.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"memprofile":"/tmp/memory-usage.log"}' -u user:pword
----

// To be added after deciding whether to add this engineering method.
// <note>For another way to set this, see the Capturing Profiling Info
// section.</note>

| `pipeline-batch`
| int
| `16`
3+a|
[Optional] Controls the number of items execution operators can batch for Fetch from the KV.

.Example

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"pipeline-batch":64' -u user:pword
----

| `pipeline-cap`
| int
| `512`
3+a|
[Optional] Maximum number of items each execution operator can buffer between various operators.

----

| `prepared-limit`
| int
| `16384`
3+a|
The number of bytes the Prepared Limit sizes the prepared statement cache.

When this cache reaches the limit, the least recently used prepared statements will be discarded as new prepared statements are created.

.Example
----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"prepared-limit":65536}' -u user:pword
----

| `pretty`
| bool
| `false`
3+a|
[Optional] Specifies the query results returned in pretty format.

There is also a server-wide `pretty` parameter which defaults to `true`.
If a request does not include pretty, the server-wide `pretty` will be used.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -pretty true;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"pretty":false}' -u user:pword
----

| `profile`
| string
| `off`
3+a|
[Optional] Specifies if there should be a profile section returned with the request results.
The valid values are:

`off`:: No profiling information is added to the query response.

`phases`::
The query response includes a profile section with stats and details about various phases of the query plan and execution.
Three phase times will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` monitoring keyspaces.

`timings`::
Besides the phase times, the profile section of the query response document will include a full query plan with timing and information about the number of processed documents at each phase.
This information will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` keyspaces.

NOTE: If `profile` is not set as one of the above values, then the profile setting does not change.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -profile "phases";

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"profile":"phases"}' -u user:pword
----

| `request-size-cap`
| int

----
curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"request-size-cap":70000}' -u user:pword
----

| `scan-cap`
| int
| `512`
3+a|
[Optional] Maximum buffered channel size between the indexer client and the query service for index scans.
This parameter controls when to use scan backfill.

Use `0` or a negative number to disable.

Smaller values reduce GC while larger values reduce indexer backfill.

The index channel capacity is configurable per request.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -scan_cap 1024;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"scan-cap":1024}' -u user:pword
----

| `servicers`

----

| `timeout`
| string (duration format)
| `"0s"`
3+a|
[Optional] Maximum time to spend on the request before timing out.

The default value means no timeout is applied and the request runs for however long it takes.

NOTE: There is also a server-wide `timeout` parameter, and the minimum of that and the request `timeout` is what gets applied.

Its format includes an amount and a mandatory unit.
Valid units are:

[#ul_cym_xhc_m1b]
* `ns` (nanoseconds)
* `us` (microseconds)
* `ms` (milliseconds)
* `s` (seconds)
* `m` (minutes)
* `h` (hours)

Ex: "10ms" (10 milliseconds) and "0.5s" (half a second).

Specify `0` or a negative integer to disable.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -timeout "30m";

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"timeout":"30m"}' -u user:pword

== Request-Level Parameters

This table contains details of all the parameters that can be passed in a request to the /query/service endpoint:

.Request-Level Parameters
[#table_fbs_vjk_k1b,cols="185,100,180,110,824"]
|===
| Parameter Name | Type | Default 2+| Description

| `args`
| list
| 
2+a|
[Optional] If the statement has 1 or more positional parameters, this parameter needs to be in the request; this is a list of JSON values, one for each positional parameter in the statement.

NOTE: Positional parameters apply to `prepared` also.

.Example
----
cbq > \set -args ["LAX", 6];
----

See section <<section_srh_tlm_n1b,Named Parameters VS.
Positional Parameters>> for details.

| `batch_args`
| list of list
| 
2+a|
[Optional] Applies to POST requests containing UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statements.

DML statements containing _positional_ parameters.

.Example
----
INSERT INTO location (id, name) VALUES ($1, $2)
----

These require the values to be given in `batch_args`, which contains a list of lists.

NOTE: The inner lists need to match the positional parameters in the `statement`.

| `batch_named_args`
| list of object
| 
2+a|
[Optional] Applies to POST requests only, containing a UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statement.

DML statements containing _named_ parameters.

.Example
----
INSERT INTO location (id, name) VALUES ($id, $n)
----

These require the values to be given in `batch_named_args`, which contains a list of objects.

NOTE: The keys in each object need to match the named parameters in the `statement`.

| `client_context_id`
| string
| 
2+| [Optional] A piece of data supplied by the client that is echoed in the response, if present.
N1QL is agnostic about the content of this parameter; it is just echoed in the response.

Note:

1) Maximum allowed size is 64 characters; all others will be cut.

2) If it contains an escape character (‘/’) or quote ("), it will be rejected as Error code 1110.

| `compression`
| string
| `"NONE"`
2+a|
[Optional] Compression format to use for response data on the wire.

Possible values are `ZIP`, `RLE`, `LZMA`, `LZO`, or `NONE`.

Values are case-insensitive.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -compression "zip";
----

| `controls`
| bool
| `false`
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies if there should be a controls section returned with the request results.

When set to `true`, the query response document includes a controls section with runtime information provided along with the request, such as positional and named parameters or settings.

NOTE: If the request qualifies for caching, these values will also be cached in the `completed_requests` system keyspace.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -controls true;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"controls":true}' -u user:pword
----

| `creds`
| list
| 
2+a|
[Optional] Specify the login credentials in the form of `user:password`.

You can specify credentials for different buckets by separating them with a comma.

If credentials are supplied in the request header, then `creds` is ignored since HTTP Basic Authentication takes precedence and overrides `creds`.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -creds travel-sample user:pword, beer-sample user:pword;
----

// To be added after confirming the latest info
// <p>See Authentication Parameters
// section <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>at GD:
// N1QL Query API<?oxy_custom_end?> for full spec.</p>

| `encoded_plan`
| string
| 
2+a|
[Optional] For later, multiple executions, a query can be prepared, which results in five properties, of which one is called encoded_plan.
This can then be used to execute the query.

*Example*: Prepare the query result of the most expensive hotel.

 $ curl -v http://localhost:8093/query/service \
 -d 'statement=PREPARE pricy_hotel FROM SELECT name, max(price) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel";

Response:

----
{
  "requestID": "a339a496-7ed5-4625-9c64-0d7bf584a1bd",
  "signature": "json",
  "results": [
  {   "encoded_plan": "H4sIAAAJbogA/5yRQU/6QBDFvwpZ/gdIIAAA==",
        "name": "fave_tweets",
----

Use the `encoded_plan` to execute that prepared statement.

 $ curl -v http://localhost:8093/query/service -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
 '{ "prepared":"pricy_hotel", "encoded_plan":"H4sIAAAJbogA/5yRQU/6QBDFvwpZ/gdIIAAA==", "$r":9.5 }'

Both the encoded plan and the prepared N1QL statement output the same.

| `encoding`
| string
| `"UTF-8"`
2+| [Optional] Desired character encoding for the query results.

Only possible value is `UTF-8` and is case-insensitive.

| `format`
| string
| `"JSON"`
2+a|
[Optional] Desired format for the query results.

Possible values are `JSON`, `XML`, `CSV`, and `TSV`.

Values are case-insensitive.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -format "XML";
----

| `max_parallelism`
| string
| `"1"`
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies the maximum parallelism for the query.

A zero or negative value means the number of logical CPUs will be used as the parallelism for the query.

A server-wide `max_parallelism` parameter defaults to "1" and will be used when a request does not include this parameter.

If a request includes `max_parallelism`, it will be capped by the server `max_parallelism`.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -max-parallelism 3;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"max-parallelism":0}' -u user:pword
----

| `metrics`
| bool
| `false`
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies that metrics should be returned with query results.

There is also a server wide `metrics` parameter which defaults to `true`.
If a request does not include `metrics`, the server wide metrics will be used.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -metrics false;

curl http://localhost:8093/query/service -u user:pword -d 'statement=select * from default&metrics=true'
----

| `namespace`
| string
| 
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies the namespace to use.

There is a server-wide namespace parameter, which is used if a request does not specify a namespace.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -namespace travel-sample;
----

| `pipeline_batch`
| int
| 
2+a|
[Optional] Controls the number of items execution operators can batch for Fetch from the KV.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -pipeline_batch 64;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"pipeline-batch":64}' -u user:pword

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"pipeline-cap":1024}' -u user:pword
----

| `prepared`
| string
| 
2+a|
[Required if `statement` not provided]

The prepared form of the N1QL statement to be executed.

NOTE: If both `prepared` and `statement` are present and non-empty, an error is returned.

*Example*: Prepare the query result of the most expensive hotel.

 $ curl -v http://localhost:8093/query/service \
 -d 'statement=PREPARE pricy_hotel FROM SELECT name, max(price) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="hotel";

Response:

----
{
  "requestID": "a339a496-7ed5-4625-9c64-0d7bf584a1bd",
  "signature": "json",
  "results": [
  {   "encoded_plan": "H4sIAAAJbogA/5yRQU/6QBDFvwpZ/gdIIAAA==",
        "name": "fave_tweets",
----

Use the `encoded_plan` to execute that prepared statement.

 $ curl -v http://localhost:8093/query/service -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  \
 '{ "prepared":"pricy_hotel", "encoded_plan":"H4sIAAAJbogA/5yRQU/6QBDFvwpZ/gdIIAAA==", "$r":9.5 }'

Both the encoded plan and the prepared N1QL statement output the same.

| `pretty`
| bool
| `true`
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies the query results returned in pretty format.

NOTE: There is also a server-wide `pretty` parameter which defaults to `true`.
If a request does not include pretty, the server-wide `pretty` will be used.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -pretty true;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"pretty":false}' -u user:pword
----

| `profile`
| string
| `"off"`
2+a|
[Optional] Specifies if there should be a profile section returned with the request results.
The valid values are:

`off`:: No profiling information is added to the query response.

`phases`::
The query response includes a profile section with stats and details about various phases of the query plan and execution.
Three phase times will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` monitoring keyspaces.

`timings`::
Besides the phase times, the profile section of the query response document will include a full query plan with timing and information about the number of processed documents at each phase.
This information will be included in the `system:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` keyspaces.

NOTE: If `profile` is not set as one of the above values, then the profile setting does not change.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -profile "phases";

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"profile":"phases"}' -u user:pword
----

| `readonly`
| bool
| `false`
2+a|
[Optional] Controls whether a query can change a resulting recordset.

If `readonly` is `true`, then the following statements are not allowed:

[#ul_shj_ggm_n1b]
* CREATE INDEX
* DROP INDEX
* INSERT
* MERGE
* UPDATE
* UPSERT

NOTE: When using GET requests, it's best to set `readonly` to `true`.

NOTE: There is a server-wide `readonly` parameter; and if that is true, it supersedes the request `readonly` parameter.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -readonly true;
----

| `scan_cap`
| int
| `512`
2+a|
[Optional] Maximum buffered channel size between the indexer client and the query service for index scans.
This parameter controls when to use scan backfill.

Use `0` or a negative number to disable.

Smaller values reduce GC while larger values reduce indexer backfill.

The index channel capacity is configurable per request.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -scan_cap 1024;

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"scan-cap":1024}' -u user:pword
----

| `scan_consistency`
| string
| `"not_bounded"`
2+a|
[Optional] Specify the consistency guarantee/constraint for index scanning.
The valid values are:

`not_bounded`::
No timestamp vector is used in the index scan.
This is the fastest mode, because it avoids the costs of obtaining the vector and waiting for the index to catch up to the vector.

`at_plus`::
This implements bounded consistency.
The request includes a scan_vector parameter and value, which is used as a lower bound.
This can be used to implement read-your-own-writes (RYOW).

`request_plus`::
This implements strong consistency per request.
Before processing the request, a current vector is obtained.
The vector is used as a lower bound for the statements in the request.
If there are DML statements in the request, RYOW is also applied within the request.

`statement_plus`::
This implements strong consistency per statement.
Before processing each statement, a current vector is obtained and used as a lower bound for that statement.

NOTE: The default behavior is RYOW within the request, however, if you want to disable RYOW within a request, add a separate `request_consistency` parameter that can be set to `not_bounded`.

Values are case-insensitive.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -scan_consistency "at_plus";
----

| `scan_vector`
| list or object
| 
2+a|
[`scan_vector` or `scan_vectors` is required if `scan_consistency=at_plus`]

Specify the lower bound vector timestamp for one bucket when using `at_plus` scan consistency.

Scan vectors are built of [[.var]`value`, [.var]`guard`] entries, two-element arrays:

[#ul_mnh_nkd_m1b]
* [.var]`value`: a vbucket's sequence number (a JSON number)
* [.var]`guard`: a vbucket's UUID (a string)

.Example
----
scan_vector={ "5 ": [5409393,"VB5ID"], "19": [47574574, "VB19ID"] }
----

Scan vectors have two forms:

[#ol_fln_zdw_l1b]
. *Full scan vector*: an array of [[.var]`value`, [.var]`guard`] entries, giving an entry for every vbucket in the system.
. *Sparse scan vectors*: provide entries for specific vbuckets, mapping a vbucket number (a string) to a [[.var]`value`, [.var]`guard`] entry.

NOTE: `scan_vector` can only be used if the query uses at most one bucket; if it is used for a query referencing more than one bucket, the query will fail with an error.

For queries referencing multiple buckets, use `scan_vectors`.

| `scan_vectors`
| object
| 
2+| [`scan_vector` or `scan_vectors` is required if `scan_consistency=at_plus`]

A map from bucket names to scan vectors.
See `scan_vector`.

The scan vectors can be Full or Sparse.

| `scan_wait`
| string (duration format)
| `""`
2+a|
[Optional] Can be supplied with `scan_consistency` values of `request_plus`, `statement_plus` and `at_plus`.

Specifies the maximum time the client is willing to wait for an index to catch up to the vector timestamp in the request.

NOTE: If an index has to catch up, and the `scan_wait` time is exceeded while waiting, an error is returned.

Its format includes an amount and a mandatory unit.
Valid units are:

[#ul_jmg_hww_l1b]
* `ns` (nanoseconds)
* `us` (microseconds)
* `ms` (milliseconds)
* `s` (seconds)
* `m` (minutes)
* `h` (hours)

Ex: `10ms` (10 milliseconds) and `0.5s` (half a second).

NOTE: Specify `0` or a negative integer to disable.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -scan_wait "30m";
----

| `signature`
| bool
| `true`

[Optional] Include a header for the results schema in the response.

NOTE: There is a server-wide `signature` parameter which defaults to true and will be used if a request does not include `signature`.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -signature false;

curl http://localhost:8093/query/service -u user:pword -d 'statement=select * from default&signature=false'
----

| `statement`
| string
| 
2+a|
[Required if `prepared` not provided]

Any valid N1QL statement for a POST request, or a read-only N1QL statement (SELECT, EXPLAIN) for a GET request.

NOTE: If both `prepared` and `statement` are present and non-empty, an error is returned.

| `timeout`
| string (duration format)
| `"0s"`
2+a|
[Optional] Maximum time to spend on the request before timing out.

The default value means no timeout is applied and the request runs for however long it takes.

NOTE: There is also a server-wide `timeout` parameter, and the minimum of that and the request `timeout` is what gets applied.

Its format includes an amount and a mandatory unit.
Valid units are:

[#ul_k1t_h3c_m1b]
* `ns` (nanoseconds)
* `us` (microseconds)
* `ms` (milliseconds)
* `s` (seconds)
* `m` (minutes)
* `h` (hours)

Ex: `10ms` (10 milliseconds) and `0.5s` (half a second).

NOTE: Specify `0` or a negative integer to disable.

.Example
----
cbq> \set -timeout "30m";

curl http://hostname:8093/admin/settings -d '{"timeout":"30m"}' -u user:pword
----

| `$<identifier>`
| json_value
| 
2+a|
[Optional] If the `statement` has 1 or more named parameters, there should be 1 or more named parameters in the request.

A named parameter consists of two parts:

[#ol_hvv_3kc_m1b]
. The $ character
. An identifier that starts with an alpha character followed by one or more alphanumeric characters.

Named parameters apply to `prepared` also.

See section <<section_srh_tlm_n1b,Named Parameters VS.
Positional Parameters>> for examples.

== Named Parameters VS. Positional Parameters

Named Parameters use a variable name to refer to each one, while Positional Parameters refer to the position each variable is used.
As summarized in the below table, these two types of requests should contain the following parameters:

.Named Parameters VS. Positional Parameters

|===
|  | Statement | Args

| *Named Parameters*
| SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = *$nval* AND age > *$aval*
| $nval = "smith"

$aval = 45

.2+| *Positional Parameters*
| SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = *$1* AND age > *$2*
.2+| [ "smith", 45 ]

| SELECT detail FROM emp WHERE name = *?* AND age > *?*
|===

NOTE: Positional Parameters can also be specified in a statement using *?* as an alternative way to specify the same query.
