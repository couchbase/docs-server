= Configure LDAP authentication

[abstract]
The LDAP Authentication setup allows you to configure cluster-wide authentication settings for LDAP.

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a public standard that facilitates distributed directories (such as network user privilege information) over the network.
LDAP is an optional feature that allows you to map the Couchbase cluster administrator role to LDAP users.
