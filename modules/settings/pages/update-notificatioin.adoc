= Update Product Notifications

[abstract]
The [.ui]*Software Updates* page allows the client to determine whether a newer version of Couchbase Server is available.

Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can update notifications function.

During installation, you can choose to enable the [.ui]*Update Notification* function.
After installation, you can also enable or disable the setting from the [.ui]*Couchbase Web Console* > [.ui]*Settings* > [.ui]*Software Updates* tab.

To enable the update notifications using the Web Console:

. From the [.ui]*Couchbase Web Console* > [.ui]*Settings* > select the [.ui]*Software Updates* tab.
. Select the [.ui]**Enable software update notifications**check box to enable the updates and click [.ui]*Save*.

If update notifications are disabled, then the [.ui]*Software Updates* page only notifies you of your currently installed version, and no alert is provided.

If you enable the update notifications, the Couchbase Web Console communicates with Couchbase Server to confirm the version number of your Couchbase Cluster.
During this process, the client also submits the following information back to Couchbase Server:

* The current version of your Couchbase Server installation.
* Basic information about the data size and performance.
* The configuration of your Couchbase cluster such as which features are used.

This information is used to help Couchbase prioritize development efforts.

The update notification communication to Couchbase occurs in the browser accessing the web console, not from the Couchbase cluster itself.
No further configuration or internet access is required in the Couchbase Server to enable this functionality.
The update notification process works anonymously, and the data cannot be tracked.
Identifiable information such as bucket names, bucket data, design document names and hostnames are not transmitted.

If an update is available, the notification will look like the following in the Couchbase Web Console:

NOTE: If the browser or the machine you are using to connect to your Couchbase Web Console does not have Internet access, the update notification system does not work.
