= Define Failover Settings

[abstract]
When enabled, the auto-failover feature will automatically failover a node identified as unresponsive or unavailable.

Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can enable auto-failover feature.

Automatic failover is disabled by default.
When you enable the auto-failover, it is enabled for all services except for the Index Service.
The timeout settings determine how long a node is unresponsive to the rest of the cluster before the auto-failover process triggers a failover.

== Using the UI

To enable the automatic failover using the Web Console:

. From the [.ui]*Couchbase Web Console* > [.ui]*Settings* > select the [.ui]*Auto-Failover* tab.
. Select the [.ui]*Enable auto-failover* check box to enable the setting.
. To set the delay in seconds before auto-failover is started, enter the number of seconds in the [.ui]*Timeout* box and click [.ui]*Save*.
The default timeout is 120 seconds.
In almost all cases, it is recommended to leave the timeout at the default.

== Using the CLI

The automatic failover settings can be changed using the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-autofailover.adoc[setting-autofailover] command in `couchbase-cli`.

== Using the REST API

The automatic failover settings can be changed using the REST API xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-autofailover-enable.adoc[/settings/autoFailover] endpoint.

Below is an example of changing the automatic failover settings using the REST API:
