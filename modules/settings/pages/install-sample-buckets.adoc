= Install sample buckets

[abstract]
The [.uicontrol]*Sample Buckets* tab allows you to install the sample bucket data if it has not already been loaded in the system.

If the sample bucket data was not loaded during setup, select the sample buckets that you want to load using the check-boxes and click [.uicontrol]*Create*.

If the sample bucket data has already been loaded, it is listed under the [.uicontrol]*Installed Samples* section of the page.

[NOTE]
====
The sample buckets are located in the Couchbase installation directory as .zip files as well.
On Linux, the default location would be [.path]_/opt/couchbase/samples_

The sample bucket Zip files can be loaded into the cluster by using the xref:cli:cbdocloader-tool.adoc#cbdocloader_tool[cbdocloader]tool.

Example:

----
 /opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -n localhost:8091 -u Admin -p Pass -b mybucket -s 100 /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
