Sample Buckets contain data that is ready to be experimented with.

Only Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can install sample buckets.

The *Sample Buckets* screen appears as follows:

To install sample buckets:

[#ol_uk4_cjw_zy]
. From the [.ui]*Couchbase Web Console* > [.ui]*Settings* > select the [.ui]*Sample Buckets* tab.
. Select the sample buckets that you want to load using the check boxes and click [.ui]*Load Sample Data*.

If the sample bucket data has already been loaded, it is listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.

Note that as well as being accessible from the *Sample Buckets* screen, sample buckets are also available as zip files, in the Couchbase installation directory (whose default location on Linux would be `/opt/couchbase/samples`.
The zip files can be loaded by means of the xref:cli:cbdocloader-tool.adoc#cbdocloader_tool[cbdocloader] tool.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -n localhost:8091 -u Admin -p Pass -b mybucket -s 100 /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
----
