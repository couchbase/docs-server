= Cluster

[abstract]
The [.uicontrol]*Cluster* panel can be used to establish settings for the cluster.

Only Full Administrators and Cluster Administrators can configure cluster settings.

Use the [.uicontrol]*Settings > Cluster* tab to configure the cluster name, memory quotas, and index settings.
You can define the settings using Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, or the REST API.

| Index Service
| This setting controls the buffer cache size of the index storage layer.
The specified memory is pre-allocated as soon as the indexer starts up, and is shared with all indexes created on the node.
The total memory usage of the indexer process will be the buffer cache plus the size of various internal data structures and queues.

| Search Service
| This setting controls the RAM quota for Full Text search.
It shows the amount of the main memory allocation for Full Text service per node.

| Analytics Service
| This setting controls the RAM quota for Analytics.

If *Restricted* is specified, the UI expands, to display configurable fields into which the URLs allowed and disallowed can be entered.

== Advanced Index Settings for Standard and Memory-Optimized Indexes

Define the Global Secondary Index type as Standard or Memory-Optimized option and then click [.uicontrol]*Show Advanced Index Settings* pull-down menu.

[#table_advindex,cols="1,4"]
