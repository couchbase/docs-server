== Configure Cluster

You can set the cluster setting:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Setting | Description

| Cluster Name
a|
The name that was given during the initial setup, which you can edit in the UI, change with the CLI command or with a call to the REST API:

----
couchbase-cli setting-cluster -c localhost -u Admin -p Pass --cluster-name="New Cluster Name"
----

or

----
curl -u Admin:Pass -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default -d clusterName="New Cluster Name"
----
|===

== Cluster RAM Quota

You can set the following RAM settings:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Setting | Description

| RAM Available
| The per node RAM that is available to Couchbase services limited to the smallest node in the cluster.

| Data RAM Quota
a|
The per node memory allocation for the key-value cache used by the data service.
At a minimum, it cannot be made smaller than the sum per node bucket quota of all buckets combined.
This value can be adjusted in the UI, with the CLI or with the REST API.

Example:

----
 couchbase-cli setting-cluster -c localhost -u Admin -p Pass --cluster-ramsize=600
----

or

----
curl -u Admin:Pass -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default -d memoryQuota=600
----

| Index RAM Quota
a|
This setting controls the buffer cache size of the index storage layer.
The specified memory is pre-allocated as soon as the indexer starts up, and is shared with all indexes created on the node.
The total memory usage of the indexer process will be the buffer cache plus the size of various internal data structures and queues.
You can adjust the per-node memory in the UI, with the CLI command or with the REST API.

Example

----
couchbase-cli setting-cluster -c localhost -u Admin -p Pass --cluster-index-ramsize=300
----

or

----
curl -u Admin:Pass -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default -d indexMemoryQuota=300
----

| Full Text RAM Quota
| This setting controls the RAM quota for Full Text search.
It shows the amount of the main memory allocation for Full Text service per node.
|===

== Index Settings for Global and Memory-Optimized Indexes

You can set the following index settings:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Setting | Description

| Indexer Threads
a|
The number of dedicated threads used by the Index Service.
The number can be increased on multi-core machines to increase the amount of CPU available to the Indexer.
The default is 4 and you can adjust it in the UI or with the REST API.

Example:

----
curl -X POST -u Admin:Pass http://localhost:8091/settings/indexes -d indexerThreads=3
----

| Max Rollback Points
a|
Maximum number of the committed rollback points.
The default is 5 and you can adjust it in the UI or with the REST API.

Example:

----
curl -X POST -u Admin:Pass http://localhost:8091/settings/indexes -d maxRollbackPoints=6
----

| Indexer Log Level
| Adjust the logging level from least to most verbose, the options are `Silent`, `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Verbose`, `Timing`, `Debug`, and `Trace`, with the default being `Debug`.
It is advised to leave this setting as the default unless Couchbase Support directs you to change it.
|===

// <dl>
// <dlentry>
// <dt>In Memory Snapshot Interval</dt>
// <dd>Frequency of in-memory snapshots which determines the earliest possibility an indexer
// scan can discover a data service Key/Value mutation.
// The default is 200 milliseconds and
// you  can adjust it in the UI or with the REST API.
// <p>Example:</p><codeblock>curl -X POST -u Admin:Pass http://localhost:8091/settings/indexes -d memorySnapshotInterval=300</codeblock></dd>
// </dlentry>
// </dl>
