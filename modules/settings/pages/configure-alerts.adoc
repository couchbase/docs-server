= Configure alerts

[abstract]
The alerts option raises email alerts when a significant error occurs on your Couchbase Server cluster.

The email alert system works by sending an email directly to a configured SMTP server.
Each alert email is sent to the list of configured email recipients to highlight specific issues and problems that you should be aware of and may need to check to ensure the health of your Couchbase cluster.
Alerts are also provided as a popup within the Couchbase Web Console.

It is important to ensure that all Couchbase Server nodes have network access to the configured SMTP server.

Select the [.ui]*Enable email alerts* check box to enable the configuration of email alerts.
These alerts are raised for the errors that you select in the [.ui]*Available Alerts* section.

It is also possible to configure Email alerts using the xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-email-notifications.adoc[REST API.]

== Email Server Settings

The available settings are:

.Email Server Settings
[#table_server,cols="1,4"]
|===
| Options | Description

| Host
| The hostname of the SMTP server that will be used to send the email.

| Port
| The TCP/IP port to be used to communicate with the SMTP server.
The default is the standard SMTP port 25.

| Username
| For email servers that require a username and password to send email, the username is used for authentication.

| Password
| For email servers that require a username and password to send email, the password is used for authentication.
Note that when you save the settings you enter, the password that you typed into the Password field becomes invisible, and the field therefore appears blank.
This is a security measure imposed by Couchbase Server: the password remains valid, and will be used in authenticating with the email server.

| Require TLS
| Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) when sending the email through the designated server.

== Email Settings

.Email settings
[#table_email_settings,cols="1,4"]
|===
| Option | Description

| Sender email
| The email address identified as a source from which the email is sent.
This email address should be one that is valid as a sender address for the SMTP server that you specify.

| Recipients
| A list of the recipients of each alert message.
To specify more than one recipient, separate each address by a space, comma, or semicolon.

| Test Mail
| Click [.ui]*Test Mail* to send a test email to confirm the settings and configuration of the email server and recipients.
|===

== Available Alerts

You can enable individual alert messages that can be sent by using the series of check boxes.
The supported alerts are:

.Available alerts
[#table_alerts,cols="2,3"]
|===
| Alert | Description

| The node was auto-failed-over
| The sending node has been failed over automatically.

| The maximum number of auto-failed-over nodes was reached
| The auto-failover system stops auto-failover when the maximum number of spare nodes available has been reached.

| The node wasn't auto-failed-over as other nodes are down at the same time
| Auto-failover does not take place if there is already a node down.

| The node wasn't auto-failed-over as the cluster was too small (less than three nodes)
| You cannot support auto-failover with less than three nodes.

| Node's IP address has changed unexpectedly
| The IP address of the node has changed, which may indicate a network interface, operating system, or other network or system failure.

| Disk space used for persistent storage has reach at least 90% of capacity
| The disk device configured for storage of persistent data is nearing full capacity.

| Metadata overhead is more than 50%
| The amount of data required to store the metadata information for your dataset is now greater than 50% of the available RAM.

| Bucket memory on a node is entirely used for metadata
| All the available RAM on a node is being used to store the metadata for the objects stored.
This means that there is no memory available for caching values.
With no memory left for storing metadata, further requests to store data will also fail.

Only applicable to buckets with Value-only ejection policy.
See xref:architecture:db-engine-architecture.adoc[Eviction Policy].

| Writing data to disk for a specific bucket has failed
| The disk or device used for persisting data has failed to store persistent data for a bucket.
