= Kafka Connector 2.0

[abstract]
The Kafka connector provides functionality to stream, filter, and transform events from Couchbase Server to Kafka.

The Couchbase Kafka connector enables you to send data events from a Couchbase Server cluster to a https://kafka.apache.org[Kafka] cluster by using the Couchbase database change protocol (DCP).

The Kafka Connector includes the following components:

* Java client (source code)
* Developer guide and reference documentation
* Sample applications

== Compatibility

Because the Kafka connector relies heavily on DCP, it is only compatible with Couchbase Server 3.0 and later.

== Contributing

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Kafka connector.
The https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-kafka-connector[Kafka Connector source code] is available on GitHub.
