= Couchbase ODBC and JDBC Drivers

The ODBC and JDBC drivers provide the ability to connect to BI tools of your choice - including Microsoft Excel, QlikView, SAP Lumira, or Tableau - to Couchbase Server.
These drivers enable fast and seamless access to Couchbase data.
Using these drivers, you can leverage on the speed of Couchbase Server and the flexibility of N1QL under the hood, all while using your own SQL-query expertise.

The ODBC and JDBC drivers are provided by Simba Technologies.
