= Couchbase ODBC and JDBC Drivers
:description: The ODBC and JDBC drivers enable any application based on the ODBC/JDBC standards, for example Microsoft Excel, QlikView, SAP Lumira, or Tableau, to connect to a Couchbase Server or cluster.

{description}
These drivers enable fast and seamless access to Couchbase data.
Using these drivers, the applications can leverage on the powerful {sqlpp} functionality to efficiently store and process JSON documents at scale.

Couchbase ODBC and JDBC drivers are compliant with ODBC 3.8 and JDBC 4.0/4.1 standards, and compatible with ANSI SQL-92.
With the support for {sqlpp}, these drivers empower both ODBC/JDBC and {sqlpp} applications to connect to Couchbase server.
The drivers are available from our preferred and supported connectivity partner, CDATA (http://www.cdata.com/drivers/[^]).
