= Couchbase ODBC and JDBC Drivers

The ODBC and JDBC drivers enable any application based on the ODBC/JDBC standards, for example Microsoft Excel, QlikView, SAP Lumira, or Tableau, to connect to a Couchbase Server or cluster.
These drivers enable fast and seamless access to Couchbase data.
Using these drivers, the applications can leverage on the powerful N1QL functionality to efficiently store and process JSON documents at scale.

Couchbase ODBC and JDBC drivers are developed and distributed by Simba Technologies.
These drivers are compliant with ODBC 3.8 and JDBC 4.0/4.1 standards, and compatible with ANSI SQL-92.
With the support for N1QL, these drivers empower both ODBC/JDBC and N1QL applications to connect to Couchbase server.
The drivers are available from our partners Simba Technologies (http://www.simba.com/drivers/[^]) and CDATA (http://www.cdata.com/drivers/[^]).
