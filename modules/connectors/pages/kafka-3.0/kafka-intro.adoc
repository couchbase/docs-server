[#kafka-3-intro]
= Kafka Connector 3.0

[abstract]
The Kafka connector provides functionality to stream, filter, and transform events from Couchbase Server to Kafka.

The Couchbase source connector allows you to import data from Couchbase Server into https://kafka.apache.org[Kafka] topics.

Data is loaded efficiently and reliably using Couchbase's internal replication protocol, DCP.
Every change to or deletion of the document generates a replication event, which is then sent to the configured Kafka topic.
When copying data from a bucket, the connector loads only new or modified documents.

== Compatibility

Because the Kafka connector relies heavily on DCP, it is only compatible with Couchbase Server 3.0 and later.

== Contributing

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Kafka connector.
The https://github.com/couchbase/kafka-connect-couchbase[Kafka Connector source code] is available on GitHub.
