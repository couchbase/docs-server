*What's new in Kafka Connector 3.0.0*

[#ul_qfx_wq2_3y]
* Kafka Connect - This release is based on http://docs.confluent.io/3.0.0/connect/intro.html[Kafka Connect], a mechanism in Apache Kafka 0.9 and higher versions for scalably and reliably streaming data between Apache Kafka and other systems.
+
Here are some advantages for Ops teams:

[#ul_ghy_s52_3y]
 ** Part of Kafka
 ** One service to manage with connector configuration handled internally.
 ** Unified connector control, monitoring, and metrics.
 ** Easy to set up as a self-service system for developers and ETL team.
 ** Integrated with any configuration management or container system.

Here are some advantages for application developers and ETL engineers:

[#ul_mmf_bv2_3y]
 ** Configuration-only solution for copying large scale data to/from Kafka.
 ** Built for real-time ETL.
 ** Out of the box tools such as https://www.confluent.io/product/control-center/[Confluent Control Center] dashboards can visualize the complete data pipeline.

* *Dynamic topology* - The Kafka Connector now handles rebalance and failover scenarios.
Adding and removing nodes to an active Couchbase Server cluster no longer requires restarting the Kafka Connector.
(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/KAFKAC-7[KAFKAC-7])
* *Node-aware partition distribution* - For efficiency reasons, the Couchbase Kafka Connector 3.0 uses the Couchbase Server cluster map to send DCP stream partitions to Kafka tasks so that they use the smallest number of DCP socket connections.
* Connector *maintains replication state* and can resume streaming from where it left off after a temporary disconnection.
(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/KAFKAC-47[KAFKAC-47])
* *Faster serialization* - Couchbase sequence numbers are now persisted as Kafka Connect http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/connect/userguide.html#offsets[offsets] instead of Zookeeper nodes, thus making the serializer faster.
(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/KAFKAC-44[KAFKAC-44])
* *SSL support* - You can enable SSL support by simply setting a configuration property.
(https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/KAFKAC-52[KAFKAC-52])
* *Bulk mode for snapshot transmission* - You can now enable bulk mode for DCP Snapshots, so that the offsets are only committed in Kafka once the entire snapshot is received.
This avoids creating duplicates caused by retransmission of mutations in more than one DCP snapshot.
