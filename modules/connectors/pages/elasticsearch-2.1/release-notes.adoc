= Release notes

The Couchbase plug-in for Elasticsearch integrates Couchbase Server and Elasticsearch, a full-text search engine, by streaming data in real-time from Couchbase to Elasticsearch.
The combined solution enables you to build richer and more powerful apps with full-text search, indexing and querying and real-time analytics for variety of use cases such as a content store or aggregation of data from different data sources.

== Elasticsearch plug-in 2.1.1 (September 2015)

This release note applies to the 2.1.1 version of the Elasticsearch transport-couchbase plug-in.
It adds compatibility with newer Elasticsearch versions up to 1.7.x, multiple new features, and quite a few bug fixes, including several that solve issues found in 2.1.0.
In particular, this release fixes a long-standing bug with an incorrect concurrent bulk request counter, which could eventually cause the plug-in to stop accepting requests from Couchbase Server altogether.

Some of the configuration option names have changed.
For information about the option names, see xref:elasticsearch-2.1/adv-usage.adoc[Advanced settings and usage].
