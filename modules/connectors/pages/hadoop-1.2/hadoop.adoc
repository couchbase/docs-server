= Hadoop Connector
:description: pass:q[The Couchbase Hadoop Connector has reached End-of-Life (EOL), _and is no longer supported_.]

{description}
The Couchbase Hadoop Connector is not compatible with Couchbase Server 5.x or 6.x; because it relies on the TAP feed API which has been removed since Couchbase Server 5.x, in favor of the DCP feed.
We recommend existing Hadoop integrations to migrate to a supported version of the xref:kafka-connector::index.adoc[Couchbase Kafka Connector].
