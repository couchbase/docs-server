= Hadoop Connector
:page-topic-type: concept

The Couchbase Hadoop Connector has reached End-of-Life (EOL) support.
We recommend existing Hadoop integrations to migrate to a supported version of the xref:kafka-connector::index.adoc[Couchbase Kafka Connector].
Additionally, the Couchbase Hadoop Connector is not compatible with Couchbase Server 5.x; because it relies on the TAP feed API which has been removed in Couchbase Server 5.x in favor of the DCP feed.
