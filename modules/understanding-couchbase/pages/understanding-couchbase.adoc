An overview of Couchbase Server's core features.

[#key_elements_and_concepts]
== Core Features

This section provides descriptions of Couchbase Server's core features.
The descriptions are organized as follows:

* *Data*: Couchbase Server stores data as _items_.
Each item consists of a _key_, by which the item is referenced; and an associated _value_, which must be either _binary_ or a _JSON document_.
+
See xref:data/data.adoc[Data] for information.

* *Buckets, Memory, and Storage*: Items are stored in named _Buckets_; being kept only in memory, others both in memory and on disk.
+
See xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets-memory-and-storage.adoc[Buckets, Memory, and Storage] for information.

* *Services and Indexes*: _Services_ can be deployed to support different forms of data-access: for example, the _Data Service_ allows items to be retrieved by _key_; while the _Query Service_ allows them to be retrieved by means of _queries_, designed in the _N1QL_ query-language.
Individual services can be configured to run across multiple cluster-nodes, allowing high-priority workloads to be distributed and scaled appropriately.
_Indexes_ support services, by enabling high-performance access to data.
+
See xref:services-and-indexes/services-and-indexes.adoc[Services and Indexes] for information.

* *Clusters and Availability*: A single node running Couchbase Server is considered a _cluster_ of one node.
As successive nodes are initialized, each can be configured to join the existing cluster.
+
Across the nodes of each cluster, Couchbase data is evenly distributed and replicated: nodes can be removed, and node-failure handled, without data-loss.
Data can be selected for replication across clusters residing in different data centers, to ensure high availability.
+
See xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Clusters and Availability] for information.

[#couchbase-glossary]
== Couchbase Glossary

The following glossary introduces the principal terms used in descriptions of Couchbase Server-technology.
Use the links to locate the full descriptions of each.

* xref:introduction:intro.adoc[Server]: An instance of _Couchbase Server_ — an open source, distributed, NoSQL document-oriented engagement database, specialized to provide low-latency data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and other applications.
Each instance runs on its on physical or virtual machine.

* xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Cluster]: One or more instances of Couchbase Server, each running on an independent node; but cooperating with any and all others, so as to form a unified system; whereby resources are shared, and a single interface provided for data-access and management.

* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Bucket]: A logical, user-named entity that groups items; allowing them to be accessed, indexed, replicated, and access-controlled.
There are three types:

 ** *Couchbase*: Retains data both in memory and on disk.

 ** *Ephemeral*: Retains data in memory only.

 ** *Memcached*: Designed to be used in the context of other database platforms, such as ones employing relational database technology, in order to provide a managed memory-cache for frequently-used data.

* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc[Memory]: An automatically managed caching layer, supporting high-speed data-access.

* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc[Storage]: The persistent retention of items on disk, in compressed form, with high-speed threaded access.

* xref:data/data.adoc[Data]: Items, each of which consists of a key by which the item is referenced; and an associated value, which must be either binary or a JSON document.

 ** Access: The creation, update, and deletion of items, as supported by the xref:admin:ui-intro.adoc[Couchbase Web Console UI] and the xref:sdk:development-intro.adoc[Couchbase SDK].

 ** xref:data/document-data-model.adoc[Model]: A lightweight, flexible schema; which can be progressively evolved by applications over time, and allows information to be stored in the form of items.

* xref:clustersetup:server-setup.adoc[Node]: A computer (potentially, a virtual machine) running an instance of Couchbase Server.

 ** xref:clustersetup:adding-nodes.adoc[Addition]: The ability to add a Couchbase Cluster of one node to another existing cluster, so that a single, combined cluster is produced.
Following addition, rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.

 ** xref:clustersetup:failover.adoc[Failover]: The ability to allow healthy nodes to continue functioning as a cluster, potentially without data-loss, when one node has gone offline.
Rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.
Failover can be automated.

 ** xref:clustersetup:remove-nodes.adoc[Removal]: The ability to remove a node from a cluster.
Following removal, rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.

* xref:clustersetup:rebalance.adoc[Rebalance]: The process of redistributing data and indexes optimally among the available nodes of a cluster.
This should be performed whenever a cluster-configuration has changed.

* xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Availability]: The preservation of data from system-failure, by the following means:

 ** xref:backup-restore:backup-restore.adoc[Backup and Restore]: The storing in archive-repositories of the current state of data, indexes, and bucket configurations; and the restoration of such state to a running cluster.

 ** xref:xdcr:xdcr-intro.adoc[Cross Datacenter Replication] (_XDCR_): The replication of data between clusters, to ensure the least chance of data-loss in the event of data-center failure, and to provide high-performance data-access for globally distributed applications.

 ** xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-recovery.adoc[Data Recovery]: The restoration of current data to a node that is recovered from failure: either by updating data still held locally, or by substituting current data from other nodes.

 ** xref:clusters-and-availability/replication-architecture.adoc#intra-cluster-replication[Intra-Cluster Replication]: The maintenance and continuous update of data-copies, distributed across the nodes of a cluster, to ensure the least chance of data-loss in the event of single-node failure.

* xref:install:get-started.adoc[Deployment]: The installation of a single instance of Couchbase Server, subsequent to the appropriate resourcing and configuration of an underlying platform.

 ** xref:cloud:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc[Cloud]: Couchbase Server runs on a pre-established cloud-configuration.

 ** xref:install:running-couchbase-in-containers.adoc[Container]: Couchbase Server runs within a software container or virtual machine.

 ** xref:install:install-intro.adoc[Native]: Couchbase Server runs on an individual, physical machine.

* xref:install:init-setup.adoc[Initialization]: The configuration of a new instance of Couchbase Server, either as the first node in a new cluster, or as an additional node for an existing cluster.

* xref:security:security-intro.adoc[Security]: Couchbase-Server Authentication, Authorization, Auditing, and Encryption.

 ** xref:security:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication]: To access Couchbase Server, administrators and applications must be authenticated.
Authentication is a process for identifying a user who is attempting to access a system.
Authentication can be attempted by passing credentials, or by means of certificates.

 ** xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization]: Role-Based Access Control (_RBAC_), whereby access-privileges are assigned to fixed roles that are themselves assigned to administrators and applications.

 ** xref:security:security-auditing.adoc[Auditing]: The detailed, automated recording of actions performed on Couchbase Server, allowing administrative review; in order to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately performed.

 ** xref:security:security-encryption.adoc[Encryption]: SSL/TLS, used to encrypt data passed over the wire.

* xref:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services]: Couchbase Server-facilities that support different forms of data-access:

 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/analytics-service.adoc[Analytics]: Supports join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations that are expected to be large, long-running, and highly consumptive of memory and CPU resources.

 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data]: Supports the storing, setting, and retrieving of data-items, specified by key.

 ** xref:eventing:eventing-overview.adoc[Eventing]: Supports near real-time handling of changes to data: code can be executed both in response to document-mutations, and as scheduled by timers.

This supports language-aware searching; allowing users to search for, say, the word beauties, and additionally obtain results for beauty and beautiful.

* xref:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Scaling]: The optional allocation of services to cluster-nodes in accordance with workload-requirements.
For example, if a particular service is expected to handle a heavy workload, it can be allocated a large memory quota, and might be deployed as the only service on its node, to ensure optimal availability of CPU cycles.

* xref:admin:admin-intro.adoc[Tools]: Provided by Couchbase Server to support cluster-management:

 ** xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI]: Command-line-based management.

 ** xref:admin:ui-intro.adoc[Couchbase Web Console]: UI-based management.
