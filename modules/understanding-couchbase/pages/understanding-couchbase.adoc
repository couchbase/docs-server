An overview of Couchbase Server's core features.

[#key_elements_and_concepts]
== Core Features

This section provides descriptions of Couchbase Server's core features.
The descriptions are organized as follows:

{blank}

* *Data*: Couchbase Server stores data as _items_.
Each item consists of a _key_, by which the item is referenced; and an associated _value_, which must be either _binary_ or a _JSON document_.
+
See xref:data/data.adoc[Data] for information.
+
{blank}

* *Buckets, Memory, and Storage*: Items are stored in named _Buckets_; being kept only in memory, others both in memory and on disk.
+
See xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets-memory-and-storage.adoc[Buckets, Memory, and Storage] for information.
+
{blank}

* *Services and Indexes*: _Services_ can be deployed to support different forms of data-access: for example, the _Data Service_ allows items to be retrieved by _key_; while the _Query Service_ allows them to be retrieved by means of _queries_, designed in the _N1QL_ query-language.
Individual services can be configured to run across multiple cluster-nodes, allowing high-priority workloads to be distributed and scaled appropriately.
_Indexes_ support services, by enabling high-performance access to data.
+
See xref:services-and-indexes/services-and-indexes.adoc[Services and Indexes] for information.
+
{blank}

* *Clusters and Availability*: A single node running Couchbase Server is considered a _cluster_ of one node.
As successive nodes are initialized, each can be configured to join the existing cluster.
+
Across the nodes of each cluster, Couchbase data is evenly distributed and replicated: nodes can be removed, and node-failure handled, without data-loss.
Data can be selected for replication across clusters residing in different data centers, to ensure high availability.
+
See xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Clusters and Availability] for information.

[#couchbase-glossary]
== Couchbase Glossary

The following glossary introduces the principal terms used in descriptions of Couchbase Server-technology.
Use the links to locate the full descriptions of each.

{blank}

* xref:introduction:intro.adoc[Server]: An instance of _Couchbase Server_ â€” an open source, distributed, NoSQL document-oriented engagement database, specialized to provide low-latency data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and other applications.
Each instance runs on its on physical or virtual machine.

{blank}

* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Bucket]: A logical, user-named entity that groups items; allowing them to be accessed, indexed, replicated, and access-controlled.

+
{blank}
 ** *Couchbase*: Retains data both in memory and on disk.

{blank}

 ** *Ephemeral*: Retains data in memory only.

 ** xref:clustersetup:remove-nodes.adoc[Removal]: The ability to remove a node from a cluster.
Following removal, rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.
+
{blank}

* xref:clustersetup:rebalance.adoc[Rebalance]: The process of redistributing data and indexes optimally among the available nodes of a cluster.
This should be performed whenever a cluster-configuration has changed.
