= XDCR Conflict Resolution

[abstract]
_XDCR Conflict Resolution_ automatically synchronizes copies of the same
document that have been modified in different ways at different locations.

[#conflicts_and_conflict_resolution]
== Conflicts and Conflict Resolution

A conflict is where the same document is modified in two different locations
before the document has been synchronized between the locations.
To maintain consistency between these two locations, one version has to be
chosen as the correct version: this task is performed automatically by
_conflict resolution_.

Couchbase Server supports two forms of conflict resolution:
<<revision-id-based-conflict-resolution,_revision-based_>> (which is
the default),
and <<timestamp-based-conflict-resolution,_timestamp-based_>>.

Note that _timestamp-based_ conflict resolution is only available in the
Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server.

[#the_conflict_resolution_process]
== The Conflict Resolution Process

When a source document is modified, XDCR determines whether this revision
of the document should be applied to the destination. For documents
above 256 bytes in size, XDCR fetches metadata
from the target cluster before replicating.
The target cluster metadata is compared with the metadata of the updated
document
on the source cluster, in order to choose which
should prevail (the exact subset of metadata used in this comparison
depends on the
source bucket's _conflict resolution_ policy). If the source
document prevails, it is replicated to the target; if the target document
prevails, the source document is not replicated.

Once a replicated document reaches the target, the target cluster also
performs a metadata comparison as described, in order
to confirm that the document from the source cluster should indeed
prevail. If this is confirmed, the document from the source cluster is
applied to the target cluster, and the target cluster's previous version
of the document is discarded.

As a performance optimization, XDCR makes no metadata comparison on
the source for
documents of 256 bytes or less, thus making unnecessary
a metadata-fetch from the
target cluster: instead, the document is replicated
immediately to the target, and conflict resolution is performed there.

Conflict resolution is an automatic process and does not require any manual
correction or selection of documents.

[#revision-id-based-conflict-resolution]
== Revision-Based Conflict Resolution

Revision-based conflict resolution uses the document's _revision ID_
as the first field to
resolve conflicts between two writes across clusters. Revision IDs are
maintained per document and are incremented with every update to the document.
The revision ID monotonically keeps track of the number of mutations to a
document, thus revision ID-based conflict resolution can be best characterized
as 'the most updates wins'.
XDCR initially compares the revision ID of the source document with the
revision ID of the equivalent destination document.
The document with more revisions is considered the 'winner'.

In the event that both document-versions have the same revision ID, the
conflict is resolved by comparing the following metadata-elements, in the
order shown:

. CAS value
. Expiration (TTL) value
. Document flags

For conflict resolution between an incoming mutation from another cluster and
a local mutation in the current cluster: if the incoming mutation does not
have a higher revision ID than the local mutation, it will be discarded and
will not be stored.
In the case of bidirectional replication, this process results in the mutation
with the highest revision ID taking precedence on both clusters.

The key point is that the number of document mutations is the main factor that
determines whether XDCR keeps a document version or not.
This means that the document that has the most recent mutation may not be
necessarily the one that wins conflict resolution using revision ID.

[#timestamp-based-conflict-resolution]
== Timestamp-Based Conflict Resolution

Timestamp-based conflict resolution uses the document timestamp (stored in the
CAS) as the first field to resolve conflicts between two writes across clusters.
Couchbase Server uses a hybrid logical clock (HLC), a combination of a physical
clock and a logical clock, to store the timestamp and keep consistent ordering
of mutations.

Using timestamp-based conflict resolution, document-updates with the most
recent timestamp will 'win' conflict resolution.
As such timestamp-based conflict resolution can be best characterized as
'last write wins'.
XDCR initially compares the timestamp of the source document with the timestamp
of the equivalent destination document.
The document with a higher timestamp value is considered the 'winner'.

In the event that both document versions have the same timestamp value, the
conflict is resolved by comparing the following metadata-elements, in the
order shown:

. Revision ID
. Expiration (TTL) value
. Document flags

For conflict resolution between an incoming mutation from another cluster and
a local mutation in the current cluster, if the incoming mutation does not have
a higher timestamp value than the local mutation, it will be discarded and will
not be stored.
In the case of bidirectional replication, this process results in the mutation
with the highest timestamp value taking precedence on both clusters.

The key point is that the timestamp of the most recent mutation is the main
factor that determines whether XDCR keeps a document version or not.
This means that the document has received the most mutations may not be
necessarily the one that wins conflict resolution using the timestamp.

[#time-synchronization]
==== Time Synchronization

Timestamp-based conflict resolution requires the use of _synchronized clocks_
across all nodes in all clusters intended to participate in XDCR..
If clocks are not so synchronized, document
mutations may improperly prevail as a consequence of conflict resolution.
To achieve such synchronicity, an
external entity such as NTP (Network Time Protocol) is required.
For information, see
xref:install:synchronize-clocks-using-ntp.adoc[Clock Sync with NTP].

Even with optimal clock synchronicity, small
differences may persist between the clock-settings on different nodes and
clusters:
this is known as _time skew_.
Time skew between clusters should always be closely monitored, to ensure that
timestamp-based conflict resolution functions correctly.
For more details, see
xref:xdcr-monitor-timestamp-conflict-resolution.adoc[Monitoring XDCR
Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution].

To compensate for time skew, and and to allow for updates that
could theoretically be received on the same clock tick, Couchbase Server records
time stamps using a _Hybrid Logical Clock_ (HLC).
This is a combination of a physical and a logical clock: the physical clock is
the time returned by the system, in nanoseconds; the logical clock is a counter,
which is incremented when the physical clock yields
a value either smaller or equal to the currently stored physical clock value.
The HLC:

* Is monotonic through its use of a logical clock.
This ensures that it does not suffer from the potential leap-back of a purely
physical clock.
* Captures the ordering of mutations.
* Is close to physical time.

The CAS of a document is used to store the hybrid logical clock timestamp.
It is a 64-bit value, with the most significant 48 bits representing the
physical clock, and the least significant 16 bits representing the logical clock.
Each mutation has its own hybrid logical clock timestamp.

[#use-cases]
==== Use Cases Supported by Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution

Timestamp-based conflict resolution only supports the following
use cases.

[#high_availability_with_cluster_failover]
==== High Availability with Cluster Failover

All database operations go to data center A, and are replicated to data
center B.
If the cluster located in data center A fails, the application redirects all
traffic to data center B.

[#datacenter_locality]
==== Datacenter Locality

Two active clusters operate on discrete sets of documents.
This ensures that no conflicts are generated during normal operation.
Bidirectional replication is configured, so that each cluster
replicates its updates to the other.
When one cluster fails, application traffic is failed over to the other,
still-available cluster.

image::xdcr/timestamp_datacenter_locality.png[,470]

[#ensuring_safe_failover]
=== Ensuring Safe Failover

When failover is required,
timestamp-based conflict resolution requires that applications
redirect traffic to the still-available
cluster only after the greater of the following two time-periods has
elapsed:

* The replication latency between data centers A and B.
This provides sufficient time for any _in-flight_ mutations
to be received by data center B.
* The absolute time skew between data centers A and B.
This ensures that any writes to data center B commence after the last write to
data center A.

When availability is restored to data center A, applications must observe the
same time period, before again redirecting their traffic.
For both use cases described above, timestamp-based conflict
resolution ensures that the most recent version of each document is
preserved.

[#choosing_a_conflict_resolution_method]
== Choosing a Conflict Resolution Method

The conflict resolution policy is configured on a per-bucket basis at bucket
creation time, it cannot be changed later.
For more information, see xref:clustersetup:create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
It is therefore important to choose the correct conflict resolution method for
your application requirements to avoid unintended side effects.
Choosing the correct conflict resolution method requires consideration of the
application logic as to which version of the document is the most useful as
the data in 'losing' version is discarded.

To illustrate how application logic affects the choice of conflict resolution
method, two simple examples are provided.

*Example 1 - Most Updates is Best*

Consider a hit counter for a website, stored as a counter document within
Couchbase Server which is incremented on every access.
In the event of a conflict occurring, you would want the version of the
document has been incremented the most, as that will more closely reflect
the actual count.
Revision ID-based conflict resolution would be preferable in this instance
as it ensures that the document which has been mutated the most 'wins'.

*Example 2 - Most Recent Update is Best*

Consider a thermometer device which stores the current temperature in
Couchbase Server, writing to the same key repeatedly.
In the event of a conflict occurring, you would want to keep the version
of the document which was captured most recently, as that is the most
accurate 'current' temperature.
Timestamp-based conflict resolution ensures that the most recent version
of the document would be used.

== Aligning Source and Target Conflict Resolution Policies

XDCR replications cannot be created between buckets with
different conflict resolution policies: source and target
buckets must always be configured with the same policy.

When using XDCR with a source cluster running a pre-4.6 version of
Couchbase Server, only revision-based conflict resolution can be used.
