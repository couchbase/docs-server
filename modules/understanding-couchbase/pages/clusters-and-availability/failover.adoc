= Failover

[abstract]
_Failover_ is the process in which a node of a Couchbase cluster can be removed
with urgency, due to unforeseen circumstances.

There are three types of failover: [.term]_graceful_, [.term]_hard_, and [.term]_automatic_.


* _Graceful_: The ability to remove a Data service node from the cluster
proactively, in an orderly and controlled fashion.
This is an online operation, requiring zero downtime. It
is achieved by promoting replica vBuckets on the remaining cluster nodes to
_active_, and the active vBuckets on the affected node to _dead_.
This type of failover is primarily used for planned maintenance of the cluster.

* _Hard_: The ability to drop a node quickly from the cluster when it has become unavailable or unstable.
Dropping a node is achieved by promoting replica vBuckets on the remaining cluster nodes to active.
Hard failover is primarily used when there is an unplanned outage of a node.

* _Automatic_: The built-in ability to have the Cluster Manager detect and
determine when a node is unavailable and then initiate a hard failover.

Each of the Couchbase Services reacts differently to failover.
For example, if services run on different nodes, you can
failover and recover nodes separately.
If multiple services run on the same node, failover is more complex.

== Choosing a Failover Solution

As a node failover has the potential to reduce the performance of your cluster,
you should consider how best to handle a failed node situation and also
size your cluster to plan for failover.

* _Manual or monitored failover_:
Performing manual failover through monitoring can take two forms, either by human monitoring or by using a system external to the Couchbase Server cluster.
An external monitoring system can monitor both the cluster and the node environment so that you can make a more data-driven decision.
Although automated failover has inherent issues, choosing whether to use manual or monitored failover is not without potential problems.

* _Human intervention_: One option is to have a human operator respond to alerts and make a decision.
Humans are uniquely capable of considering a wide range of data, observations, and experiences to resolve a situation in a best possible way.
Many organizations disallow automated failover because they want a human to consider the implications.
The drawback is that human intervention is slower than using a computer-based monitoring system.

* _External monitoring_: Another option is to have a system monitoring the cluster via the Couchbase REST API.
Such an external system can failover nodes successfully because it can take into account system components that are outside the scope of Couchbase Server.
+
For example, monitoring software can observe that a network switch is failing and that there is a dependency on that switch by the Couchbase cluster.
The system can determine that failing Couchbase Server nodes will not help the situation and will, therefore, not failover the node.
The monitoring system can also determine that components around Couchbase Server are functioning and that various nodes in the cluster are healthy.
+
If the monitoring system determines the problem is only with a single node and remaining nodes in the cluster can support aggregate traffic, then the system may safely failover the node using the REST API or command-line tools.

* _Automatic failover_: The Cluster Manager handles the detection, determination of, and initiation of the processes to failover a node without user intervention and without identification of the issue that caused the node failure.
Once the problem has been identified and fixed, it still requires you to initiate a rebalance to return the cluster to a healthy state.
+
If you do not use automatic failover and a node becomes unhealthy, it will be up to the administrators to intervene and initiate
hard failover of the node.

== Graceful and Hard Failover: Differences

A hard failover is reactionary and usually comes when a node of the cluster is in an unhealthy or unstable state (such as when a node is down).
It would be used during an unplanned outage.
With a node failed, the cluster is without the full accompaniment of active vBuckets.
A hard failover will eject the unhealthy node from the cluster and promote the necessary replica vBuckets on the remaining nodes to bring the active vBucket count back to 1024 for each bucket

A graceful failover, which is a coordinated synchronization and removal of the node,  is a proactive action initiated from a stable state of the cluster.
It might be used, for example, during a software or OS upgrade.
The cluster always has the full 1024 active vBuckets for each Bucket throughout the process.
