[abstract]
Couchbase Server _indexes_ enhance the performance of query and search operations.

== Indexes

The following forms of index are available:

* _Primary_: Provided by the xref:services-and-indexes/services/index-service.adoc[Index Service], this is based on on the unique key of every item in a specified bucket.
Every primary index is maintained asynchronously.
A primary index is intended to be used for simple queries, which have no filters or predicates.
For information on creating a primary index, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createprimaryindex.adoc[CREATE PRIMARY INDEX].
* _Secondary_: Provided by the _Index Service_, this is based on an attribute _within_ a document.
The value associated with the attribute can be of any type: scalar, object, or array.
+
A Secondary Index is frequently referred to as a _Global Secondary Index_, or _GSI_.
This is the kind of index used most frequently in Couchbase Server, for queries performed with the _N1Ql_ query-language.
GSIs are also likely to be used extensively by the xref:services-and-indexes/services/analytics-service.adoc[Analytics Service].

* _Full Text_: Provided by the xref:services-and-indexes/services/search-service.adoc[Search Service], this is a specially purposed index, which contains targets derived from the textual contents of documents within one or more specified buckets.
Text-matches of different degrees of exactitude can be searched for.
Both input and target text-values can be purged of irrelevant characters (such as punctuation marks or html tags).
For information on how to create Full Text Indexes, see xref:fts:fts-creating-indexes.adoc[Creating Indexes].
* _View_: Supports _Couchbase Views_, with fields and information extracted from documents.
