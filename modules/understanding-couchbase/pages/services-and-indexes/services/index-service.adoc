= Index Service

[abstract]
The _Index Service_ supports the creation of _primary_ and _secondary_ indexes on items stored within Couchbase Server.

== Index Service Architecture

Components essential for the _Index Service_ reside not only on each node to which the Index Service is assigned, but also on each node to which the _Data Service_ is assigned, as shown by the following illustration:

The illustration depicts the following:

{blank}

* *Data Service*: Uses the DCP protocol to stream data-mutations to the *Projector and Router* process, which runs as part of the Index Service, on each Data Service node.
+
{blank}

* *Projector and Router*: Provides data to the Index Service, according to the index-definitions provided by the Index Service Supervisor.
+
When the *Projector and Router* starts running on the Data Service-node, the Data Service streams to the *Projector and Router* copies of all mutations that occur to bucket-items.
Prior to the creation of any indexes, the *Projector and Router* takes no action.
+
When an index is first created, the Index Service *Supervisor* contacts the *Projector and Router*; and passes to it the corresponding index-definitions.
The *Projector and Router* duly contacts the Data Service, and extracts data from the fields specified by the index-definitions.
It then sends the data to the *Supervisor*, so that the index can be populated.
+
Subsequently, the *Projector and Router* continuously examines the stream of mutations provided by the Data Service.
When this includes a mutation to an indexed field, the mutated data is passed by the *Projector and Router* to the *Supervisor*, and the index thereby updated.
+
{blank}

* *Supervisor*: The main program of the Index Service; which passes index-definitions to the *Projector and Router*, creates and stores indexes, and handles mutations sent from the *Projector and Router*.
+
{blank}

* *Query Service*: Passes to the *Supervisor* clients' create-requests and queries, and handles the responses.

== Saving Indexes

By default, an index is saved on the node on which it is created.
Each index is created on one bucket only; but multiple indexes may be created on a single bucket.

The Index Service can be configured to use either _standard_ or _memory-optimized_ storage:

{blank}

* _Standard_: The supervisor process persists to disk all changes made to individual indexes.
Each index gets a dedicated file.
Writes can either be _append-only_  or _write with circular reuse_, depending on the write mode selected for global secondary indexes.
+
{blank}

* _Memory-Optimized_: Indexes are saved in-memory.
This provides increased efficiency for maintenance, scanning, and mutation.
efficient index maintenance and index scans.
A _skiplist_ (rather than a conventional _B-tree_) structure is used; optimizing memory consumption.
Lock-free index-processing enhances concurrency.

== Using Global Secondary Indexes

_Secondary_ Indexes, often referred to as _Global Secondary Indexes_ or _GSIs_, constitute the principal means of indexing documents to be accessed by the _Query Service_.
Secondary Indexes can be created on specified fields; placed on specific cluster-nodes; and replicated.
