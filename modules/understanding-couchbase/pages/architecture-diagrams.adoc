= Architecture Diagrams

[abstract]
A quick reference to architecture diagrams in Couchbase documentation.

Through the Couchbase documentation-set, explanations of the architecture
of Couchbase Server are supported diagrammatically. Each diagram is
co-located with its textual description. This page provides a quick-reference,
whereby each diagram can be directly accessed.

The following diagrams are provided:

* Couchbase Server supports _multidimensional scaling_, whereby services can be
distributed and resources with the greatest flexibility, across the designated
nodes of a cluster. This is explained and diagrammatically represented in
xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc#setting-up-services[Setting Up
Services].

* The Couchbase _Data Service_ is the most fundamental of all Couchbase services,
providing access to data in memory and on disk. The diagram in
xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data
Service] shows its architecture, and the interactions of its inner components.

* The Couchbase _Query Service_
supports the querying of data by means of the N1QL query language. Its
architecture and the query processing-sequence it supports
are explained by the diagrams in
xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/services/query-service.adoc[Query
Service].

* The Couchbase _Index Service_ supports the creation of primary and secondary
indexes on items stored within Couchbase Server.
Components essential for the Index Service reside not only on each node to
which the Index Service is assigned, but also on each node to which the
Data Service is assigned, as shown by the illustration in
xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/services/index-service.adoc[Index
Service].

* The Couchbase Cluster Manager runs on all the nodes of a cluster,
maintaining essential per-node processes, and coordinating cluster-wide
operations. Its architecture is explained by the diagram in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster
Manager].

This page also provides a detailed diagram for the most important component of the Cluster
Manager,
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc#ns-server[ns-server].

* The replication architecture whereby data within a cluster is kept highly
available is illustrated in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster
Replication].

* _Cross Data Center Replication_ (XDCR) is the process whereby data can be
replicated to a remote cluster. The topographical options for XDCR set-up are
shown by the diagrams in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-direction-and-topology[XDCR
Direction and Topology].

* _Server Group Awareness_ allows individual server-nodes to be assigned to
specific _groups_, within a Couchbase Cluster. This allows active vBuckets to
be maintained on a different group from that of their corresponding replica
vBuckets; so that if a group goes offline, bucket-data remains available on
another group. Possible group layouts, and the effects of failover, are
illustrated diagrammatically in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server
Group Awareness].

* xref:understanding-couchbase:data/data.adoc#size-limits[Data Size Limits]: A
data-item stored by Couchbase Server has multiple inner components, each of
which has a fixed size limit. This diagrams shows the components and their
sizes.

* The
xref:understanding-couchbase:data/document-data-model.adoc#documents-versus-tables[Relational
and Json] data
models have fundamental differences, explained here graphically.

* The mapping of Couchbase _buckets_, which are used to group data-items
logically, to underlying shards on disk, known as vBuckets, is expressed
as a detailed diagram, in
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.adoc#understanding-vbuckets[Understanding
vBuckets].

* _Compression_ is used by Couchbase Server, to maximize resources and heighten
performance. The communication-paths that benefit are noted diagrammatically in
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/compression.adoc#where-data-compression-can-be-used[Where
Compression is Used]

* A sequence of diagrams is provided to show the memory and storage
architecture whereby Couchbase
Server handles
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory-and-storage.adoc#saving-new-items[Saving
New Items].

* Couchbase Server monitors the memory used by buckets with respect to fixed
_memory quotas_. If watermarks are exceeded, automated management action is
taken, to ensure that the data items most needed are retained in memory, and
those less needed removed. This is explained in detail, and the relations of
memeory quotas represented graphically, in
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#ejection[Ejection].
