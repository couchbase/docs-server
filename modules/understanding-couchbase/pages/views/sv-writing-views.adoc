= Writing Spatial Views

[abstract]
Spatial views use a single spatial function that is similar to the map function used in 	MapReduce views.

A major difference between MapReduce views and spatial views is that spatial views don't have a map and a reduce function.
Spatial views have only a single so-called [.term]_spatial function_, which is very similar to the map function in MapReduce views.

To create a spatial view, use the `emit()` function.
The `emit()` function parameters are a key and value.
The key must be a multidimensional bounding box.
