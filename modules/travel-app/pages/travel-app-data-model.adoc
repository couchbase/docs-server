= Travel App Data Model
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
The data model for the travel app uses several distinct document types: airline, route, airport and landmark.

The model for each kind of document contains:

* A key that acts as a primary key
* An `id` field that identifies the document
* A `type` field that identifies the kind of document

The following figure illustrates the relationship between the different kinds of documents.
It shows the primary key, ID, and type fields that each document has, plus a few representative fields in each type of document.

== Airline Documents

[.term]_Airline documents_ contain details about airlines such as the name of the airline, International Air Transport Association (IATA) two-character airline designator, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) three-character airline designator, and the airline call sign.

For airline documents, the value of the `type` field is `airline`.

----

== Route Documents

[.term]_Route documents_ contain details about flights such as the name of the airline, departure airport, destination airport, number of stops during the flight, type of aircraft, flight number, and flight schedule.

Route documents also contain a foreign key identifier, `airlineid`, that is used to retrieve the document that contains information about the airline that flies the route.
The value of the `airlineid` field is identical to the key for the corresponding airline document.

For route documents, the value of the `type` field is `route`.
