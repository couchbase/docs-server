Pause and resume XDCR replication.

To pause and resume replication, click the replicating and paused icons under the ongoing replication status.

. Using the Couchbase Web Console, navigate to XDCR.
. To pause, under *Ongoing Replication > Status*, click on the [.uicontrol]*Replicating* icon to pause replication.
