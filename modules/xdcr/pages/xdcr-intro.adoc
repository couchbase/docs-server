= Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)

[abstract]
Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) provides an easy way to replicate data from one cluster to another.

XDCR involves replicating active data to N+1 Couchbase Server clusters or external applications (e.g.
Elastic, Spark, Storm, etc.).
The clusters are regularly used for multiple, geographically diverse datacenters either for disaster recovery or to bring data closer to users for faster data access.
For Couchbase clusters, this replication can be set up to be bi-directional or multi-directional.

XDCR provides automatic conflict resolution.
For more information, see xref:ha-dr:ha-dr-intro.adoc[High Availability and Disaster Recovery].

[IMPORTANT]
====
XDCR only replicates data, it does not replicate views or indexes.
To replicate them, you must manually or automate the push of view and index definitions between clusters.
Then that view or index will be regenerated on the destination cluster.

Non-UTF-8 encoded document IDs on the source cluster are automatically filtered out and logged.

The IDs are not transferred to the remote cluster.
If there are any non-UTF-8 keys, the warning output `xdcr_error.*` displays in the log files along with a list of all non-UTF-8 keys found by XDCR.
