[abstract]
The `set dcp_param` command establishes parameters whereby DCP messages are buffered.

== Description

The `set dcp_param` command establishes parameters whereby DCP messages are buffered.
All settings take effect immediately, but are _not_ persistent across node-restarts: therefore, following a node-restart, commands should be executed again if necessary, to re-establish desired settings.

== Syntax and Examples

The syntax for `set dcp_param` is as follows:
----
cbepctl [host]:11210 -b [bucket-name] -u [administrator-name]
  -p [administrator-password] set dcp_param [parameter] [value]
----

The options for the `parameter` and its associated `value` are as follows:

=== dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit

The `value` must be an integer, which specifies a number of messages within the buffer.
When this number is reached, the DCP processor for the node yields.

The following example sets `dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit` to 50,000:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbepctl 10.143.194.101:11210 \
-u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample \
set dcp_param dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit 50000
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
setting param: dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit 50000
set dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_yield_limit to 50000
----

=== dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size

The `value` must be an integer, which specifies the number of items the DCP processor will consume in a single batch.

The following example sets `dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size` to 5000:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbepctl 10.143.194.101:11210 \
-u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample \
set dcp_param dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size 5000
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
setting param: dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size 5000
set dcp_consumer_process_buffered_messages_batch_size to 5000
----
