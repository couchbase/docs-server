== Description

Tune the dynamic shared thread pool performance by changing the thread types inside the ep-engine and memcached at run time.
The command [.cmd]`set flush_param` adjusts the number of threads that prioritize read, write, non-i/o and auxiliary-i/o operations.
These settings take effect immediately and do not require that the bucket be restarted.

NOTE: The settings for threads number take effect only if the underlying operating system has a sufficient number of CPU cores.
The minimum number of CPU cores is four (4), but  three (3) additional cores are required for each additional writer thread.
For example, five (5) writer threads is a valid setting if the underlying hardware has at least sixteen (16) cores.

NOTE: Changes of thresholds are NOT persistent and must be reapplied after the bucket warmup.

alog_sleep_time, alog_task_time::
Couchbase Server has an optimized xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#initialization-and-warmup[disk warmup].
Couchbase Server pre-fetches a list of most-frequently accessed keys and fetches these documents first.
The server runs a periodic scanner process which determines which keys are most frequently used.
The `cbepctl flush_param` command is used to change the initial time and the interval for the process.
For example, the initial time and interval might be changed to accommodate a peak time when an application needs these keys to be quickly available.
+
By default, the scanner process runs once every 24 hours at 10:00 AM GMT.
To reduce the cluster-wide impact of running this task, stagger the start time to a different value on each node in the cluster.

exp_pager_stime::
The `cbepctl flush_param exp_pager_stime` command sets the time interval for disk cleanup.
Couchbase Server does lazy xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#expiry-pager[expiration], that is, expired items are flagged as deleted rather than being immediately erased.
Couchbase Server has a maintenance process that periodically looks through all information and erases expired items.
By default, this maintenance process runs every 60 minutes, but it can be configured to run at a different interval.
+
NOTE: The compaction process will also remove expired items.

mem_low_wat, mem_high_wat, pager_active_vb_pcnt::
xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#ejection[Ejection] means that documents are removed from RAM but the key and metadata remain.
If the amount of RAM used by items reaches the high water mark (upper threshold), both active and replica data are ejected until the memory usage (amount of RAM consumed) reaches the low water mark (lower threshold).
The server determines that items are not recently used based on a not-recently-used (NRU) value.
+
Use the `mem_low_wat`, `mem_high_wat`, and `pager_active_vb_pcnt` settings to change the server thresholds for ejection.
+
WARNING: Do not change the ejection defaults unless required by Couchbase Support.

mutation_mem_threshold::
By default, Couchbase Server sends clients a temporary out-of-memory error message if RAM is 95% consumed and only 5% RAM remains for overhead.
Use the `cbepctl set flush_param mutation_mem-threshold` command parameter to change this threshold value.
+
NOTE: Do not change this default to a higher value.
However, this value might be reduced if you need more RAM for system overhead such as disk queue or for server data structures.

== Examples

*Examples for setting the access scanner process*

To change the time interval when the access scanner process runs to every 20 minutes.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param alog_sleep_time 20
----

To change the initial time that the access scanner process runs from the 2:00 AM UTC default to 11:00 PM UTC.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param alog_task_time 23
----

This response shows the time interval changed to 20 minutes.

----
setting param: alog_sleep_time 20
set alog_sleep_time to 20
----

This response shows the initial access scanner run time changed to 11:00 PM UTC.

----
setting param: alog_task_time 23
set alog_task_time to 23
----

*Examples for setting the disk cleanup*

The following example sets the cleanup process to run every 600 seconds (10 minutes).
This is the interval that Couchbase Server waits before it tries to remove expired items from disk.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param exp_pager_stime 600
----

The following example response shows the cleanup process set to 600 seconds.

----
setting param: exp_pager_stime 600
set exp_pager_stime to 600
----

*Examples for setting the out-of-memory error message*

In this example, the threshold is reduced to 65% of RAM.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param mutation_mem_threshold 65%
----

The following example response shows the RAM threshold set to 65%.

----
setting param: mutation_mem_threshold 65
set mutation_mem_threshold to 65
----

*Example for setting the low water mark*

The low water mark sets the lower threshold of RAM for a specific bucket on a node.
The item pager stops ejecting items once the low water mark is reached.

The following example sets the low water mark percentage to 70% of RAM.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param mem_low_wat 70%
----

*Example for setting the high water mark*

The high water mark set the amount of RAM consumed by items that must be breached before infrequently used active and replica items are ejected.

The following example sets the high water mark percentage to 80% of RAM for a specific bucket on a node.
This means that items in RAM on this node can consume up to 80% of RAM before the item pager begins ejecting items.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param mem_high_wat 80%
----

*Examples for setting percentage of ejected items*

Based on the NRU algorithm, the server ejects active and replica data from a node.
By default, the server is configured to 60% active items and 40% replica data from a node.

The following example increases the percentage of active items that can be ejected from a node to 50%.

----
cbepctl 10.5.2.117:11210 -b foo-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
set flush_param pager_active_vb_pcnt 50
----

Be aware of potential performance implications when changing the percentage of ejected items.
It may be more desirable to eject as many replica items as possible and limit the amount of active data that can be ejected.
By doing so, active data from a source node is maximized while maintaining incoming requests to that node.
However, if the server is ejecting a very large percentage of replica data and a node fails, the replica data is not immediately available.
In this case, the items are retrieved from disk and put back into RAM before the request is fulfilled.

The following example response shows the low water mark, high water mark, and percentage of ejected items being set.

----
setting param: mem_low_wat 70
set mem_low_wat to 70

setting param: mem_high_wat 80
set mem_high_wat to 80

setting param: pager_active_vb_pcnt 50
set pager_active_vb_pcnt to 50
