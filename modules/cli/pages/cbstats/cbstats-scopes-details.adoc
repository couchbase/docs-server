[abstract]
Provides low-level details on scopes.

== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] scopes-details [vbucket-reference]
----

== Description

This command is used to provide low-level details on scopes, for a specified bucket.
This includes details identifying the existing scopes; and vBucket-specific details, which include sequence numbers and item counts.

== Options

The optional `vbucket-reference` parameter is an integer, in the range of `0` to `1023` inclusive, specifying a particular vBucket.
If a vBucket is specified, the only details returned are the vBucket-specific details for that vBucket.
If no vBucket is specified, vBucket-specific details for all vBuckets are returned, as well as details identifying the existing scopes for the bucket.

For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

== Examples

The following command retrieves scopes-details on all vBuckets for `travel-sample`, for the specified node:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample localhost:11210 scopes-details
----

The initial section of the output is as follows:

----
0x0:0x0:name:          _default
0x0:collections:       1
0x0:name:              _default
0x8:0x9:name:          MyCollection
0x8:collections:       1
0x8:name:              MyScope
0x9:0xa:name:          MySecondCollection
0x9:0xb:name:          MyThirdCollection
0x9:collections:       2

vb_0:scopes:           3
vb_1:0x0:              2
vb_1:0x0:0x0:items:    29
      .
      .
      .
----

Each line of the output presents a data _key_.
Each key is either of the format `scopeID` &#58; `collectionID` &#58; `datumLabel`; or of the format `scopeID` &#58; `datumLabel`.
Each `scopeID` or `collectionID` is a hexadecimal number, prefixed by `0x`.
Each `datumLabel` is a string.
Each data key is concluded with a colon, and the associated value is presented to the right of the colon.

The output's initial lines describe the scopes and collections in the bucket on the specified node.

The `manifest_uid` here associated with the current state will be incremented whenever a change is made to these scopes and their collections, on the current node.

Subsequent information in the output relates to each vBucket corresponding to `travel-sample`.
The vBuckets are numbered, from `0` to `1023`.
For each vBucket, information is provided on sequence numbers and total items.

The following command specifies a `vbucket-reference`, thereby returning information on the specified vBucket only:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample localhost:11210 scopes-details 8
----

Details for vBucket `8` are duly returned:

----
vb_8:0x0:           2
vb_8:0x0:0x0:items: 26
vb_8:0x8:           1
vb_8:0x8:0x9:items: 0
vb_8:0x9:           0
vb_8:0x9:0xa:items: 0
vb_8:0x9:0xb:items: 0
vb_8:manifest_uid:  7
vb_8:scopes:        3
