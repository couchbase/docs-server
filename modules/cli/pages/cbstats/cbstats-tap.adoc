| The maximum number of background jobs a TAP connection may have.

| `ep_tap_count`
| Number of TAP connections.

| `ep_tap_deletes`
| Number of TAP deletion messages sent.

| `ep_tap_fg_fetched`
| Number of TAP memory fetches.

| `ep_tap_noop_interval`
| The number of secs between a noop is added to an idle connection.

| `ep_tap_queue_backfillremaining`
| Number of items to be backfilled.

| `ep_tap_queue_backoff`
| Total back-off items.

| `ep_tap_queue_drain`
| Total drained items.

| `ep_tap_queue_fill`
| Total enqueued items.

| `ep_tap_queue_itemondisk`
| Number of items remaining on disk.

| `ep_tap_throttle_queue_cap`
| Disk write queue cap to throttle tap streams.

| `ep_tap_throttle_threshold`
| Percentage of memory in use before we throttle tap streams.

| `ep_tap_throttled`
| Number of TAP messages refused due to throttling.

| `ep_tap_total_backlog_size`
| Number of remaining items for replication.

| `ep_tap_total_fetched`
| Sum of all TAP messages sent.

| `ep_tap_total_queue`
| Sum of TAP queue sizes on the current TAP queues.

== Per TAP client stats

Each stat begins with ep_TAPq followed by a unique `/client_id/` and another colon.
For example, if your client is named `slave1`, the qlen stat would be `ep_TAPq:slave1:qlen`.
