== Description

The `all` command, used by the `cbstats` utility, provides information on memory, queues, persistence, and vBuckets.

== Syntax

----
cbstats <host>:<port> [common options] all
----

The `host` must be the hostname or IP address of a node within the cluster.
The port must be `11210`.
The `common options` must include a username and password, and a reference to a bucket defined on the cluster.
For a complete list of `common options`, see the table provided on the introductory page for xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc#common-options[cbstats].

This command accepts no `command options`.

== General Output

This following table describes some of the statistics returned by `cbstats all`.
Note that `ep` stands for _eventual persistence_, and simply refers to the Data Service.
