== Description

This command retrieves statistics that are logically grouped and aggregated together by prefixes.

For example, if all your DCP connections started with the string `xdcr:` or `replication:`, you could use the command [.cmd]`cbstats dcpagg` to request statistics grouped by everything before the first colon character, giving you a set for `xdcr:` statistics and a set for `replication:` statistics.

The following table describes the aggregated DCP statistics.

.Aggregated DCP statistics
[cols="2,3"]
|===
| Name | Description

| `[prefix]:count`
| Number of connections matching this prefix

| `[prefix]:producer_count`
| Total producer connections with this prefix

| `[prefix]:items_sent`
| Total items sent with this prefix

| `[prefix]:items_remaining`
| Total items remaining to be sent with this prefix

| `[prefix]:total_bytes`
| Total number of bytes sent with this prefix

| `[prefix]:total_backlog_size`
| Total backfill items remaining to be sent with this prefix
