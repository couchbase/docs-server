[abstract]
Gets statistics from the named TAP connections.

== Syntax

Request syntax:

== Description

TAP is an internal protocol that streams information about data changes between cluster nodes.
The command [.cmd]`cbstats tapagg` is used to get statistics from named TAP connections which are logically grouped and aggregated together by prefixes.

For example, if all of your TAP connections started with [.cmd]`rebalance_` or [.cmd]`replication_`, you could call [.cmd]`cbstats tapagg _` to request stats grouped by the prefix starting with `_`.
This would return a set of statistics for [.cmd]`rebalance` and a set for [.cmd]`replication`.

== TAP aggregated stats

Aggregated TAP stats allow named TAP connections to be logically grouped and aggregated together by prefixes.

For example, if all of your TAP connections started with `rebalance_` or `replication_`, you could call `cbstats tapagg _` to request stats grouped by the prefix starting with `_`.
This returns a set of statistics for rebalance and a set for replication.
The following are possible values returned by `cbstats tapagg` :

|===
| Stat | Description

| `[prefix]:count`
| Number of connections matching this prefix

| `[prefix]:qlen`
| Total length of queues with this prefix

| `[prefix]:backfill_remaining`
| Number of items to be backfilled

| `[prefix]:backoff`
| Total number of backoff events

| `[prefix]:drain`
| Total number of items drained

| `[prefix]:fill`
| Total number of items filled

| `[prefix]:itemondisk`
| Number of items remaining on disk

| `[prefix]:total_backlog_size`
| Number of remaining items for replication
