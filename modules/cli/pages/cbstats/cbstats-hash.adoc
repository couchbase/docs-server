== Syntax

Request syntax:

----
cbstats [hostname]:11210 hash
cbstats [hostname]:11210 hash detail
----

== Description

Requesting these stats does affect performance, so don’t do it too regularly, but it’s useful for debugging certain types of performance issues.
For example, if your hash table is tuned to have too few buckets for the data load within it, the `max_depth` will be too large, and performance will suffer.

It is also possible to get more detailed hash tables stats by using ‘hash detail’.
This prints per-vbucket stats.
Each stat is prefixed with `vb_` followed by a number, a colon, then the individual stat name.
For example, the stat representing the size of the hash table for vbucket 0 is `vb_0:size=.`
