[abstract]
Shows statistics for Database Change Protocol (DCP).

== Syntax

Request syuntax:

....
cbstats HOST:11210 dcp
....

== Description

This command retrieves connections specific to statistics.

DCP statistics by connection type::
DCP provides statistics for consumer, producer, and notifier connection types.
The following tables describe the available consumer, producer, and notifier connection statistics.
Each connection type has a group of statistics that apply to the connection overall and a group of statistics that apply to the individual streams in the connections.
+
The identifier for each DCP statistic begins with the string `ep_dcpq:` followed by a unique `client_id` and another colon.
For example, if your client is named `slave1`, the identifier for the DCP statistic named `created` is `ep_dcpq:slave1:created`.
+
.Consumer connection statistics
|===
| Name | Description

| `connected`
| True if this client is connected

| `created`

| `pending_disconnect`
| True if we’re hanging up on this client

| `reserved`
| True if the DCP stream is reserved

| `supports_ack`
| True if the connection use flow control

| `total_acked_bytes`

| `last_sent_time`
| The last time items have been sent.

| `noop_enabled`
| Indicates whether this connection sends noop's .

| `noop_wait`
| Indicates whether this connection is waiting for a noop response from the consumer.

| `pending_disconnect`

| `reserved`
| True if the DCP stream is reserved.

| `supports_ack`
| True if the connection uses flow control.

| `total_acked_bytes`
