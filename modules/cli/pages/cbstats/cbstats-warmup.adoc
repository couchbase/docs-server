== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
cbstats [host]:[dataport] -b [bucket_name] -p [bucket_password] raw warmup
----

== Description

If a Couchbase Server node is starting up for the first time, it creates any database files that are necessary and begins serving data immediately.
However, if there is already data on the disk, usually because the node rebooted or the service restarted, the node needs to read all of this data of the disk before it can begin serving data.
This process is called [.term]_warmup_ and it can take some time depending on the size of the data.

The information about server warmup includes the status of warmup and whether warmup is enabled.
The bucket must be specified for the bucket statistics; it does not need to be specified if the default bucket statistics is requested.

The following statistics are of particular interest when monitoring the warmup:

ep_warmup_thread::
The overall indication of whether or not warmup is still running.
Look for values: running and complete.

ep_warmup_state::
This describes which phase of warmup is currently running.
Look for values: loading keys, loading access log, and done.
* When `ep_warmup_state` is loading keys, compare `ep_warmup_key_count` (current number) with `ep_warmup_estimated_key_count` (target number).
* When `ep_warmup_state` is loading access log, compare `ep_warmup_value_count` (current number) with `ep_warmup_estimated_value_count` (target number).
