[abstract]
Provides information on collections.

== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] collections
  [ <scope>.<collection> | id <collectionID> ]
----

== Description

Displays information on collections.

== Options

When used without a command-specific option, the `collections` command returns information on all collections for the specified bucket, on the specified node.
If the `<scope>.<collection>` option is used, the command returns information on the collection so specified.
If the `id <collectionID>` option is used, the command returns information on the collection whose id is passed as the `<collectionID>` argument.

For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

== Examples

The following command retrieves all collections-related information for the bucket `travel-sample`, on the specified node:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats localhost:11210 \
-u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample collections
----

The output is as follows:

----
0x0:0x0:data_size:  19827828
0x0:0x0:items:      31592
0x0:0x0:mem_used:   21760360
0x0:0x0:name:       _default
0x0:0x0:ops_delete: 0
0x0:0x0:ops_get:    0
0x0:0x0:ops_store:  1
0x0:0x0:scope_name: _default
0x8:0x9:data_size:  68762
0x8:0x9:items:      2
0x8:0x9:mem_used:   291
0x8:0x9:name:       MyCollection
0x8:0x9:ops_delete: 0
0x8:0x9:ops_get:    2
0x8:0x9:ops_store:  2
0x8:0x9:scope_name: MyScope
manifest_uid:       4
----

Each line of the output presents a data _key_.
Each key is of the format `scopeID` &#58; `collectionID` &#58; `datumLabel`.
Each `scopeID` or `collectionID` is a hexadecimal number, prefixed by `0x`.
Each `datumLabel` is a string.
Each data key is concluded with a colon, and the associated value is presented to the right of the colon.

Within the output, each successive group of lines presents information on one of the collections for the specified bucket, on the specified node.

The first collection is identified, on each of the first eight lines, as `0x0:0x0`; and, on line four, as the `&#95;default` collection.
Line one of the output displays the total disk space occupied by this collection for the specified bucket, on the specified node: this total (here, `19827828`) is expressed in _bytes_.
The second line displays the number of items within the collection (here, `31592`).
The third line displays, again in _bytes_, the total memory used by this collection (here, `21760360`).
Lines five to seven display the numbers of deletions, gets, and writes for documents within this collection (which are `0`, `2`, and `2`, respectively).
The eighth line identifies the scope within which this collection resides: in this case, the scope is the `&#95;default` scope.

The second collection, identified as `0x8:0x9`, is shown to be named `MyCollection`.
It is shown to occupy `68762` bytes of disk space, and `291` bytes of memory.
It resides within the scope `MyScope`, and has so far received zero deletions, two gets, and two writes.

(Note that the `_default` collection is indeed provided by default, within the `_default` scope, for every Couchbase or Ephemeral bucket.
The collection `MyCollection` is one that has been custom-created by the administrator, and does not appear in the sample bucket `travel-sample` by default.)

The `manifest_uid` value (here, `4`) is associated with the current state of collections on the node; and will be incremented whenever a collections-related change is made.

The following command returns information on a collection specified by means of the `<scope>.<collection>` option:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats 127.0.0.1:11210 \
-u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample collections MyScope.MyCollection
----

The output is as follows:

----
0x8:0x9:data_size:  68762
0x8:0x9:items:      2
0x8:0x9:mem_used:   291
0x8:0x9:name:       MyCollection
0x8:0x9:ops_delete: 0
0x8:0x9:ops_get:    2
0x8:0x9:ops_store:  2
0x8:0x9:scope_name: MyScope
----

The output, for `MyCollection`, is thus a subset of that which was returned above, for _all_ collections.

The following command returns information on the same collection, specified by means of the `id <collectionID>` option:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats 127.0.0.1:11210 \
-u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample collections id 0x9
----

The `id` here specified, `0x9`, was previously identified in the output for _all_ collections as that for `MyCollection`.
The output is again as follows:

----
0x8:0x9:data_size:  68762
0x8:0x9:items:      2
0x8:0x9:mem_used:   291
0x8:0x9:name:       MyCollection
0x8:0x9:ops_delete: 0
0x8:0x9:ops_get:    2
0x8:0x9:ops_store:  2
0x8:0x9:scope_name: MyScope
----
