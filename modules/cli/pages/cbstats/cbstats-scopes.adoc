[abstract]
Provides information on scopes.

== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] scopes <scope | id scopeID>
----

== Description

This command is used to collect information on scopes.

== Options

If no command-specific option is used, the command returns information on all scopes defined for the specified bucket, on the specified node.
If either of the command-specific options is used, the command returns information on the specified scope only.

For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

== Examples

The following command retrieves all scope-related information on the bucket `travel-sample`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b travel-sample localhost:11210 scopes
----

The output is as follows:

----
0x0:0x0:name:    _default
0x0:collections: 1
0x0:disk_size:   19827828
0x0:items:       31592
0x0:mem_used:    21760360
0x0:name:        _default
0x0:ops_delete:  0
0x0:ops_get:     0
0x0:ops_store:   1
0x8:0x9:name:    MyCollection
0x8:collections: 1
0x8:disk_size:   68762
0x8:items:       2
0x8:mem_used:    291
0x8:name:        MyScope
0x8:ops_delete:  0
0x8:ops_get:     2
0x8:ops_store:   2
0x9:0xa:name:    MySecondCollection
0x9:0xb:name:    MyThirdCollection
0x9:collections: 2
0x9:disk_size:   153600
0x9:items:       0
0x9:mem_used:    0
0x9:name:        MySecondScope
0x9:ops_delete:  0
0x9:ops_get:     0
0x9:ops_store:   0
manifest_uid:    7
----

Each line of the output presents a data _key_.
Each key is either of the format `scopeID` &#58; `collectionID` &#58; `datumLabel`; or of the format `scopeID` &#58; `datumLabel`.
Each `scopeID` or `collectionID` is a hexadecimal number, prefixed by `0x`.
Each `datumLabel` is a string.
Each data key is concluded with a colon, and the associated value is presented to the right of the colon.

Within the output, each group of lines presents information on one of the scopes for the specified bucket, on the specified node.
This includes information on each of the collections the scope contains.

By means of the data key, the first line of the output declares that the scope whose ID is `0x0` contains a collection whose id is `0x0`, and whose name is `&#95;default`.
The second line of the output declares that `0x0` contains this `1` collection.
Subsequent lines describe the disk and memory occupancy of this scope; the deletes, gets, and writes performed on its documents; and the `name` of scope `0x0`; which is `&#95;default`.
(See the _cbstats_ page xref:cli:cbstats/cbstats-collections.adoc[collections], for more details on the format of these lines.)

The next group of lines starts with the declaration that a scope whose id is `0x8` contains a collection whose id is `0x0`, and whose name is `MyCollection`.
This collection is declared to be the `1` collection in scope `0x8`.
Subsequent lines provide additional details on this scope; and declare the scope to have the name `MyScope`.

(Note that the `_default` collection is indeed provided by default, within the `_default` scope, for every Couchbase or Ephemeral bucket.
Other scopes and collections used in this example &#8212; such as `MyScope` and `MyCollection` are ones that have been custom-created by the administrator, and do not appear in the sample bucket `travel-sample` by default.)

The third group of lines starts with adjacent lines that declare the collection whose id is `0x9` to contain two collections, whose ids are `0xa` and `0xb` respectively, and whose names are `MySecondCollection` and `MyThirdCollection` respectively.
Subsequent lines provide additional details on this scope; and declare the scope to have the name `MySecondScope`.

The `manifest_uid` here associated with the current state will be incremented whenever a change is made to these scopes and their collections, on the current node.

The following command returns information on the scope `MyScope`, using the `scope` option:

----
opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password -b travel-sample \
localhost:11210 scopes MyScope
----

The output is as follows:

----
0x8:0x9:disk_size:  68762
0x8:0x9:items:      2
0x8:0x9:mem_used:   291
0x8:0x9:name:       MyCollection
0x8:0x9:ops_delete: 0
0x8:0x9:ops_get:    2
0x8:0x9:ops_store:  2
0x8:0x9:scope_name: MyScope
0x8:collections:    1
0x8:disk_size:      68762
0x8:items:          2
0x8:mem_used:       291
0x8:name:           MyScope
0x8:ops_delete:     0
0x8:ops_get:        2
0x8:ops_store:      2
----

The output is thus the targeted subset of that which was returned above, for _all_ collections.

The following command returns information on the same collection, specified by means of the `id scopeID` option:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password -b travel-sample localhost:11210 scopes id 0x8
----

The `id` specified is thus `0x8`, already identified in the output for all collections as the id for `MyScope`.
The output is as follows:

----
0x8:0x9:disk_size:  68762
0x8:0x9:items:      2
0x8:0x9:mem_used:   291
0x8:0x9:name:       MyCollection
0x8:0x9:ops_delete: 0
0x8:0x9:ops_get:    2
0x8:0x9:ops_store:  2
0x8:0x9:scope_name: MyScope
0x8:collections:    1
0x8:disk_size:      68762
0x8:items:          2
0x8:mem_used:       291
0x8:name:           MyScope
0x8:ops_delete:     0
0x8:ops_get:        2
0x8:ops_store:      2
----
