[#cbcollect-info-tool]
= [.cmd]`cbcollect_info`

[abstract]
The [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` tool provides detailed statistics for a specific node.

== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
cbcollect_info [options] [output-file]
----

where `output-file` is the name of the .zip file you must send to Couchbase technical support.

== Description

The [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` command gathers statistics from an individual node in the cluster.

To collect diagnostic information for an entire cluster, run the command for every node that exists in that cluster.
If you are experiencing problems with multiple nodes in a cluster, you may need to run it on all nodes in a cluster.

A root account is required to run this command and collect all the server information.
There are internal server files and directories that this tool accesses that require root privileges.

To use this command, remotely connect to the machine which contains the Couchbase Server then issue the command with options.
This command is typically run under the direction of technical support at Couchbase and generates a large .zip file.
This archive contains files which contain performance statistics and extracts from server logs.

[caption=Attention]
IMPORTANT: [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` is one of the most important diagnostic tools.
Run [.cmd]`cbcollect_info` on all nodes in the cluster, and upload all of the resulting files to Couchbase technical support .
