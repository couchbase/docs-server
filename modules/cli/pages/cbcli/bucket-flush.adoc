[#cbcli-bucket-flush]
= [.cmd]`bucket-flush`

[abstract]
Flushes all data from the disk for a given bucket.

== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
couchbase-cli bucket-flush -c [host]:8091 -u [admin] -p [password]
    --bucket=[bucket-name] 
    --force
----

== Description

You can enable flushing when you create the bucket or edit bucket properties.
First enable this option and then issue the command to flush the bucket.

Flushing a bucket can be done as follows:

. Enable the flush bucket option.
. Flush the bucket.

By default, the [.cmd]`bucket-flush` command confirms whether or not you want to flush the bucket before performing the flush.

During a flush, any client operations will receive a temporary failure.
Once the flush is completed all operations will work as normal.

IMPORTANT: Flushing a bucket is data destructive.
Client applications using this are advised to check with the end user before sending such a request.
You can control and limit the ability to flush individual buckets by setting the `flushEnabled` parameter on a bucket in the Couchbase Web Console.

WARNING: Do not enable this option if your bucket is in a production environment.
