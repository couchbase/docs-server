[#cbstats-intro]
= [.cmd]`cbstats`

[abstract]
Retrieve lower level statistics with the [.cmd]`cbstats` utility, which provides deep insight into what occurs within a cluster.

== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
cbstats [host]: port [command] [options]
----

== Description

The [.cmd]`cbstats` tool queries differently depending on the port:

* When using the Couchbase data port 11210, it will give you operations per node per bucket:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -b beer-sample localhost:11210 all | grep \ curr_items:
curr_items:                                 3711
----

* When using the Couchbase legacy port 11211, it will query via MOXI and provide cluster-wide stats:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -b beer-sample localhost:11211 all | grep \ curr_items:
curr_items:                                 7303
----

If a named bucket is not provided, the server applies the setting to any default bucket that exists at the specified node.

The tool is found in the following locations:

The following are the command options:

[cols="100,317"]
|===
| Options | Description

| `-h, --help`

== Examples

*Example with two buckets, default and c:*

 $ cbstats localhost:12000 -b default uuid
 	uuid: 3cd3d2efb20f3b9d7d484925b6d8c03f
 	$ cbstats localhost:12000 uuid
 	uuid: 3cd3d2efb20f3b9d7d484925b6d8c03f
 	$ cbstats localhost:12000 -b c uuid
 	uuid: 1de74b8dc0981abbc6481c5276b91be1

*Example after the default bucket was deleted, and only the c bucket was left:*

 $ cbstats localhost:12000 -b default uuid
 	Authentication error for default
 	$ cbstats localhost:12000 uuid
 	<nothing>
 	$ cbstats localhost:12000 -b c uuid
 	uuid: 1de74b8dc0981abbc6481c5276b91be1

*Example for getting statistics for timings:*

To get statistics, for example, timings on host 10.5.2.117:
