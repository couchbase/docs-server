:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Retrieve lower level statistics with the [.cmd]`cbstats` utility, which provides deep insight into what occurs within a cluster.

**Note:** `cbstats` can only retrieve stats from the Data Service.

== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
cbstats host:port [common options] command [command options]
----

== Description

The [.cmd]`cbstats` tool will give you operations per node per bucket:


----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -b beer-sample localhost:11210 all | grep \ curr_items:
curr_items:                                 3711
----


If a named bucket is not provided, the server applies the setting to any default bucket that exists at the specified node.

The tool is found in the following locations:

* `uuid` is specified per bucket, therefore you must specify the bucket you are interested in.
If you don't specify a bucket (`-b XXX`), then you will get information for the `default` bucket, if it exists.
If the `default` bucket does not exist, the output will be empty.

== Examples

*Example with two buckets, default and c:*

 	$ cbstats localhost:11210 uuid
 	uuid: 3cd3d2efb20f3b9d7d484925b6d8c03f
 	$ cbstats localhost:11210 -b c uuid
 	uuid: 1de74b8dc0981abbc6481c5276b91be1
