= cbbackupwrapper and cbrestorewrapper

[abstract]
Two tools are included with Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition that improve throughput for the database backup process: [.cmd]`cbbackupwrapper` and [.cmd]`cbrestorewrapper`.

[.cmd]`cbbackupwrapper` and [.cmd]`cbrestorewrapper` were specifically created to address the single worker thread limitation for one backup/restore target (Bucket, Node).
They should be used instead of the standard backup tools, xref:cbbackup-tool.adoc[cbbackup] and xref:cbrestore-tool.adoc[cbrestore].

[.cmd]`cbbackupwrapper` and [.cmd]`cbrestorewrapper` are designed to provide a parallel processing approach to backing up a Couchbase Server cluster.
At a technical level, they divide each vBucket space into a subset of vBuckets for each backup process and thus improve the speed and efficiency.

IMPORTANT: In a future release of Couchbase Server, these two tools will be folded into [.cmd]`cbbackup` and [.cmd]`cbrestore` respectively and then deprecated.

== Syntax

== Options

The following are the command options:

.Basic command options for [.cmd]`cbbackupwrapper`
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `-h, --help`
| Show this help message and exit.

| `-b BUCKET_SOURCE, --bucket-source=BUCKET_SOURCE`
| Specify the bucket to backup.
Defaults to all buckets.

| `--single-node`
| Use a single server node from the source only.

| `-u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME`
| REST username for source cluster or server node.
Default is Administrator.

| `-p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD`
| REST password for source cluster or server node.

| `-s, --ssl`
| Transfer data with SSL enabled.

| `-v, --verbose`
| Enable verbose messaging.

| `--path=PATH`
| Specify the path to `cbbackup`.
Defaults to current directory.

| `--port=PORT`
| Specify the bucket port.
Defaults to 11210.

| `-n NUMBER, --number=NUMBER`
| Specify the number of vbuckets per process.
Defaults to 100.

| `-P PARALLELISM, --parallelism=PARALLELISM`
| Number of vbucket backup jobs to run at a time.
Defaults to 1.

| `-x EXTRA, --extra=EXTRA`
| Provide extra, uncommon config parameters; comma-separated key=val(,key=val)* pairs.

| `-m MODE, --mode=MODE`
| Backup mode: full, diff or accu [default:diff].
|===

.Additional configuration options for [.cmd]`cbbackupwrapper`
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `backoff_cap=10`
| Max backoff time during rebalance period.

| `batch_max_bytes=400000`
| Transfer this # of bytes per batch.

| `batch_max_size=1000`
| Transfer this # of documents per batch.

| `cbb_max_mb=100000`
| Split backup file on destination cluster if it exceeds MB.

| `data_only=0`
| For value 1, only transfer data from a backup file or cluster.

| `dcp_consumer_queue_length=1000`
| A DCP client needs a queue for incoming documents/messages.
A large length is more efficient, but memory proportional to `length*avg`.
doc size.
Below length 150, performance degrades significantly.

| `design_doc_only=0`
| For value 1, transfer design documents only from a backup file or cluster.

| `flow_control=1`
| For value 0, disable flow control to improve throughput.

| `max_retry=10`
| Max number of sequential retries if transfer fails.

| `recv_min_bytes=4096`
| Amount of bytes for every TCP/IP call transferred.

| `rehash=0`
| For value 1, rehash the partition IDs of each item.
Rehashing is needed when transferring data between clusters with a different number of partitions, such as when transferring data from an OS X server to a non-OS X cluster.

| `report=5`
| Number batches transferred before updating progress bar in console.

| `report_full=2000`
| Number batches transferred before emitting progress information in console.

| `seqno=0`
| By default, start `seqno` from beginning.

| `uncompress=0`
| For value 1, restore data in uncompressed mode.

This option is unsupported.
To create backups with compression, you should use `cbbackupmgr`, which is available for Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition only.
See xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[Backup].
