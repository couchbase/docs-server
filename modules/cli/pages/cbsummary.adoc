== Description

The `cbsummary` tool connects to a set of Couchbase clusters specified in a configuration file and generates a summary report.

The config file contains JSON specifying an array of information on each cluster, giving the Couchbase credentials to login, and one or more IP addresses for cluster nodes.

The default report format includes RAM and core utilization across each specified cluster, since that information is useful in determining compliance with Couchbase licenses.
If you specify `--csv`, then the report is generated in CSV instead of JSON.
If, instead, you specify `--full`, then a much more detailed report is generated.

The summary report is sent to the file `cbsummary.out.<timestamp>`, unless a different filename is specified with the `--output` option.

== Syntax

The syntax for `cbsummary` is as follows:

----
cbsummary --config=<config file> [--output=<output file>] [--full]
----

== Options

Command options are as follows:

[cols="3,3"]
|===
| Option | Description

| `--config [config file]`
| Configuration file listing clusters and credentials to connect and generate a summary.

| `--csv`
| Generate the report in CSV format.
Note that this format is not compatible with full reports.

| `--full`
| Generate an extensive report instead of just core and RAM usage.

| `-h --help`

| `--output [output file]`

== Examples

An example config file giving information about 2 clusters is:

[source, json]
----
  { "clusters": [
    {"login": "Administrator", "pass": "password1", "nodes": ["http://192.168.1.1:8091"]},
    {"login": "Administrator", "pass": "password2", "nodes": ["http://192.166.1.1:8091","http://192.16.1.2:8091"]}
