[abstract]
The [.cmd]`cbdocloader` tool is used to load a group of JSON documents in a given directory or in a single `.zip` file into a Couchbase bucket.

== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
cbdocloader  -n [host]:8091 -u [Administrator] -p [password]
		-b [bucket-name] [source-file]
----

== Description

When loading documents and any associated design documents for views, use a directory structure similar to the following:

----
/design_docs    // which contains all the design docs for views.
/docs           // which contains all the raw json data files. This can contain other sub directories too.
----

All JSON files to upload must contain well-formatted JSON.
File names should exclude spaces.

Types of errors:

* Files are not well-formatted
* Credentials are incorrect
* RAM quota for a new bucket to contain the JSON is too large given the current quota for Couchbase Server

NOTE: When uploading both JSON documents and design documents, be aware that the design documents are uploaded after all JSON documents.
