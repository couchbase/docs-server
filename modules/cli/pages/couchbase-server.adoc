== Syntax

----
couchbase-server [
          [ --start ]
          [ --status | -s ]
          [ --stop | -k ]
          [ --help | -h ]
          [ --version | -v ]
         ]
----

== Description

The `couchbase-server` command is used to control aspects of a Couchbase Server that has been installed, on a supported Linux platform, by means of the _non-root_ procedure; as described in xref:install:non-root.adoc[Non-Root Install and Upgrade].
This command _cannot_ be used to control a Couchbase Server installed by the standard, package-based install procedure.

The `--start` flag causes the non-root Couchbase Server to start.
This is the default option, and is invoked if no flag is specified.

The `--status` flag returns status on the non-root Couchbase Server, indicating whether it has been started, or has been stopped.

The `--stop` flag causes a running non-root Couchbase Server to stop.

The `--help` flag prints help text to the console.

The `--version` flag prints to the console the version number of the non-root Couchbase Server.

== Examples

The following examples show how the `couchbase-server` command and its parameters can be used.
The examples assumes that the current working directory is `<install-location/opt/couchbase/bin`.

If a non-root-installed Couchbase Server is _not_ running, the following is displayed:

----
Couchbase Server is not running
----

[#stop-non-root-couchbase-server]
=== Stop

To stop a non-root Couchbase Server, enter the following command:

----
./couchbase-server --stop

The output might appear as follows:

----
