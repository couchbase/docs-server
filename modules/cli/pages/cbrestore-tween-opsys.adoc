= rehash=1

[abstract]
Data is restored to an operating system that is different from the backup operating system using the [.cmd]`cbrestore` tool with the `rehash=1` option.

== Syntax

To restore the data to a cluster with a different operating system, connect to the 8091 port, and use the `rehash=1` option to rehash the information and distribute the data to the appropriate node within the cluster.
`rehash=1` rehashes the partition IDs of each item.
This is required when transferring data between clusters with a different number of partitions, such as when transferring data from a Mac OS X server to a non-Mac OS X cluster.

  --bucket-destination [my_bucket]

NOTE: If you backed up multiple buckets from Mac OS X and are restoring to either Linux or Windows, each bucket must be restored individually.

== Description

Couchbase Server on Mac OS X uses a different number of configured vBuckets than Linux and Windows installations.
Because of this, restoring to Mac OS X from a Linux or Windows backup or restoring to Linux/Windows from a Mac OS X backup requires the `rehash=1` option.

To backup the data (from any operating system), use the standard `cbbackup` tool and options.

== Examples

To back up data from Mac OS X:

----
cbbackup http://[Administrator]:[password]@[mac-hostname]:8091 \
/macbackup/today
----

To back up data from Linux:

----
cbbackup [Administrator]:[password]@[linux-hostname]:8091 \
/linuxbackup/today
----
