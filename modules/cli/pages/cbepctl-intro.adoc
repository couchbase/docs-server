== Description

This tool is a per-node, per-bucket operation.
That means that the IP address of a node in the cluster and a named bucket must be specified.
If a named bucket is not provided, the server applies the setting to any default bucket that exists at the specified node.
To perform this operation for an entire cluster, perform the command for every node/bucket combination that exists for that cluster.

For example, when a bucket is shared by two nodes, issue this command twice and provide the different host names and ports for each node along with the bucket name.
Similarly, when two data buckets are on the same node, issue the command twice for each bucket.
If a bucket is not specified, the command applies to the default bucket or returns an error if a default bucket does not exist.

IMPORTANT: Changes to the cluster configuration using `cbepctl` are not persisted over a cluster restart.

The tool is found in the following locations:
