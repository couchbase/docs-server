== Syntax

The basic syntax is:

----
mctimings [options] [operation-name]*
----

== Description

The [.cmd]`mctimings` tool displays timing information for Data-Service operations.
The sampling period, during which timings are taken, starts at whichever of the following points in time is the more recent:

* The last reset of Data-Service statistics by means of xref:cli/cbstats/cbstats-reset.adoc[cbstats-reset].

* The last restart of the Data Service (which itself resets Data-Service statistics).

The sampling period ends when the Data Service receives the `mctimings` request.

Note that timings taken by `mctimings` are more comprehensive than those taken by xref:cbstats/cbstats-timing.adoc[cbstats timings]; which, unlike `mctimings`, only measures the time spent on a request by a front-end worker thread; and does not include time spent fetching items from disk.

The `mctimings` tool resides in the following locations:

| Platform | Location

| Linux
| [.path]_/opt/couchbase/bin/mctimings_

| Mac OS X
| [.path]_/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/mctimings_
|===

== Options

If run without the `-v` option, `mctimings` returns timing information for all operations performed during the sampling period; in the form of a total figure for each operation.
If run _with_ the `-v` option, and with no operations explicitly specified, `mctimings` returns a timing-histogram for all  operations performed during the sampling period.
If run _with_ the `-v` option, and with one or more operations explicitly specified, `mctimings` returns a timing-histogram for each of the explicitly specified operations, as performed during the sampling period.

Note that with or without the `-v` option, the `-j` option can be used to provide output in JSON format.

Operations that can be explicitly specified include `GET` `SET`, `ADD`, `REPLACE`, `INCREMENT`, and `DECREMENT`.
A comprehensive list can be found in the https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/v4.5.1/docs/BinaryProtocol.md[memcached binary protocol reference^]:

The full list of command options is as follows:

[cols="100,317"]
|===
| Options | Description

| `-h` or `--host` `[ hostname ] &#124; [ hostname:port ]`
| The hostname of the node with which a connection is made.
If no hostname is specified, `mctimings` attempts to connect to _localhost_, by default.
The hostname can optionally be specified with the port number, in the form `hostname:port`.
For a non-secure connection, the port must be the memcached port, which is `11210`.
If no port is specified, `11210` is used by default.

If a secure connection is to be made, the port must be specified as the SSL port, which is `11207`; and the `-s` option must also be specified.

Note that alternatively, the port can be specified by means of the `-p` option.

| `-b` or `--bucket` `[bucket_name]`
| The bucket related to which timings are retrieved.
Note that the `-a` (or `--all-buckets`) and `-b` (or `--bucket`) options may not be used at the same time.

| `-p or --port` `[port]`
| The port to which a connection is made.
For a non-secure connection, this port must be specified as the memcached port, which is `11210`.
If a secure connection is to be made, the port must be specified as the SSL port, which is `11207`; and the `-s` option must also be specified.

| `-u` or `--user` `[username]`
| The username of the administrator who is authenticating.

| `-P` or `--password` `[password]`
| The password of the administrator who is authenticating.
If the specified value is a hyphen (`-`), the administrator is prompted for the password at standard input.
If the `-P` option is not used, and the `-S` option is not used, `mctimings` uses the value of the `CB_PASSWORD` environment variable, if set.
If the `-P` option is not used, and the `-S` option _is_ used, the administrator is prompted for the password at standard input.

| `-s` or `--ssl`
| Specifies that a secure connection is used.

| `-4` or `--ipv4`.
| Specifies that connection is made over IPv4.
(If neither IPv4 nor IPv6 is explicitly specified, `mctimings` attempts to use the protocol-version specified by the naming service.)

| `-6` or `--ipv6`
| Specifies that connection is made over IPv6.
(If neither IPv4 nor IPv6 is explicitly specified, `mctimings` attempts to use the protocol-version specified by the naming service.)

| `-v` or `--verbose`
| Specifies that verbose output should be displayed: meaning that operation timings are displayed as histograms.

Whenever this option is used, one or more operation names can also be specified; so as to restrict output to that corresponding to the specified operations.

If this option is _not_ used, the displayed output consists only of a _total_ figure for each of all operations performed.

If the `-j` or `--json` option is used in addition to `-v`, output is provided as JSON, rather than as histograms.

| `-S`
| Read the password from standard input.

| `-j` or `--json[=pretty]`
| Print JSON instead of histograms.

| `-f` or `--file path.json`
| Dump histogram data from a JSON file already produced by `mctimings` by means of the `-j` (or `--json`) option.

| `-a` or `--all-buckets`
| Specifies that a list of buckets should be retrieved from the node, and timings displayed per bucket.
Note that the `-a` (or `--all-buckets`) and `-b` (or `--bucket`) options may not be used at the same time.

| `-h` or `--help`
| Displays help text.

|===

== Output

The `mctimings` tool provides output of two kinds.

Output that consists only of _totals_ is generated by non-use of the `-v` option.
This displays, on each output-row, the operation name to the left, and the number of operations performed during the sample period displayed to the right.

Output that consists of _histograms with totals_ is generated by use of the `-v` option.
This displays a _legend_, which explains the histogram-format; and then, for each operation, a histogram, followed by a total.
If no operation is explicitly specified, all operations are included in the output.
If one or more operations are explicitly specified, only the explicitly specified operations are included in the output.

Each row of the histogram takes following format:

----
[ <lower-bound> - <upper-bound> ] <units> <percentile> <number-of-operations> | <hash-signs>
----

The elements are as follows:

* `lower-bound`.
The non-inclusive lower bound of the duration-window within which falls the operation-duration of each operation counted on the current row.
For example, if the `lower-bound` is `13.00`, every operation counted on the current row took longer than `13.00` to complete.

* `upper-bound`.
The inclusive upper bound of the duration-window within which falls the operation-duration of each operation counted on the current row.
For example, if the `upper-bound` is `14.00`, every operation counted on the current row took either `14.00` or less to complete.

* `units`.
The units used for `lower-bound` and `upper-bound` on the current row.
The units can be `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), or `s` (seconds).

* `(percentile)`.
The percentile, for the entire sampling period, of operations whose duration was at maximum the `upper-bound` for the current row.
For example, if the `upper-bound` is `14.00`, the `units` are `us`, and the percentile is `(65.0000%)`, this means that sixty-five percent of all operations performed during the sampling period took fourteen microseconds or less to complete.
Note that this includes operations whose duration was less than the `lower-bound` for the current row.

* `number-of-operations`.
The number of operations for the whole sampling period whose duration was within the duration-window specified on the current row.

* `hash-signs`.
A graphical representation of the number of operations counted on this row, relative to those counted on other rows.

For example, an output-row might appear as follows:

----
[ 13.00 -  14.00]us (65.0000%)	  4592| ###################
----

=== JSON Output

If the `-j` or `--json[=pretty]` option is used, output is provided as JSON.
This option may be used with or without the `-v` option.

The initial section of JSON output might appear as follows:

----
[
    {
        "memcachedBucket": "travel-sample",
        "memcachedBucketData": [
            {
                "bucketsLow": 0,
                "command": "GET",
                "data": [
                    [
                        6,
                        2,
                        0.0
                    ],
                    [
                        10,
                        843,
                        10.0
                    ],
                          .
                          .
                          .
----

The `data` array contains timings for a specified command (here, `GET`) and bucket (here, `travel-sample`).
Each element of the `data` array is itself an array, which has three members.
The first member (in the first instance above, `6`) is an _upper-bound_; the second member (`2`) is the counted number of operations; and the third member (`0.0`) is the percentile.
For the first element in the `data` array, the _lower-bound_ is inferred as `0`.
For each successive element, the _lower-bound_ is inferred as the _upper-bound_ of the previous member.

== Examples

The following examples indicate how `mctimings` can be used with different options.

=== Get Timing-Histograms for All Operations

The following example displays timing-histograms for all operations on host _localhost_, for the bucket `travel-sample`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/mctimings -h localhost:11210 -u Administrator -P password -b travel-sample -v
----

Following the explanatory legend, the first part of the (extensive) main output takes the following form:
