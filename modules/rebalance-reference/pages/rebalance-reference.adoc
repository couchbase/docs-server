== Obtaining a Rebalance Report

Couchbase Server automatically creates a _rebalance report_ for every rebalance that occurs on the cluster.
The report's content consists of a JSON document, which provide statistics for every service that has been involved in the rebalance.
On conclusion of the rebalance, the report can be accessed in any of the following ways:

* By means of Couchbase Web Console, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance].

* By means of the REST API, as described in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

* By accessing the directory `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/reblance` on _any_ of the cluster nodes.
Each successive rebalance report is provided as a `*.json` file, whose name indicates the time at which the report was run &#8212; for example, `rebalance_report_2020-03-17T11:10:17Z.json`.
