[#Obtaining-a-rebalance-report]
== Obtaining a Rebalance Report

Couchbase Server automatically creates a _rebalance report_ for every rebalance that occurs on the cluster.
The report's content consists of a JSON document, which provides statistics for every service that has been involved in the rebalance.
On conclusion of the rebalance, the report can be accessed in any of the following ways:

* By means of Couchbase Web Console, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance].

* By means of the REST API, as described in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

* By accessing the directory `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/reblance` on _any_ of the cluster nodes.
A rebalance report is maintained here for (up to) the last _five_ rebalances performed.
Each report is provided as a `*.json` file, whose name indicates the time at which the report was run &#8212; for example, `rebalance_report_2020-03-17T11:10:17Z.json`.
+
For more information on logging, see xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[Manage Logging].

[#reading-a-rebalance-report]
== Reading a Rebalance Report

Each rebalance report consists of a JSON document whose principal object is `stage_info`.
This itself contains an object corresponding to each rebalance _stage_: one stage has occurred for each of the services deployed on the cluster.
Therefore, if all six services have been deployed, six stages occur in a successful rebalance; and objects for `analytics`, `eventing`, `search`, `index` `query`, and `data` are provided.

Among the details provided for each service are the times at which rebalance-processes started and ended, the durations of rebalance-processes, and the numbers of documents already handled and still to be handled.
When rebalance concludes successfully, a report is duly generated, with all fields corresponding to the successful completion of the rebalance-processes they represent.
In cases where rebalance is interrupted (for example, by the user's left-clicking the *Stop Rebalance* button, in Couchbase Web Console, or due to auto-failover), a generated report will describe a partially unsuccessful rebalance; indicating, in certain fields, an incomplete or unstarted rebalance-process, by means of the value `false`.

[#standard-fields]
== Standard Fields

Standard fields are provided for each stage.
These are as follows:

* `startTime`.
The point in time at which the stage was started (or possibly, has been determined _not_ to have started).
Specified as a UTC date/time string.

* `completedTime`.
The point in time at which the stage was completed (or possibly, has been determined _not_ to have completed).
Specified as a UTC date/time string.

* `timeTaken`.
The amount of elapsed time since `startTime`.
Specified as an integer, in milliseconds.
The value is `undefined`, if the stage has been determined _not_ to have started.

* `totalProgress`.
The current, total progress that has been achieved for the stage.
Specified as a percentage.
In a completed report, the value is expected to be `100`.
This is an _optional_ field, which may not appear if not implemented for the stage.

* `perNodeProgress`.
The current progress that has been achieved for the stage for each node.
The value is an object, which itself provides a progress figure for each node.
Each progress figure is specified as a floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0`.
In a completed report, the value is expected to be `1`.
This is an _optional_ field, which may not appear if not implemented for the stage.

* `subStage`.
Details on any _substages_ that the stage may contain.
For each _substage_, the standard fields are identical to those for each _stage_.
This is an _optional_ field, which does not appear, if the stage contains no substages.
(An example is _delta_recovery_, which is a substage reflected in the `data` output, when _Delta Recovery Warmup_ has been performed on one or more nodes running the Data Service, during rebalance of that service.)

* `events`.
An array of strings, each of which provides information on a significant event.
The information may be a warning, an error message, or otherwise informational.
This is an _optional_ field, which does not appear if not implemented for the stage, or if no significant events have occurred.

* `details`.
Further details of the stage.
This is an _optional_ field, which is currently implemented for the `data` stage only (information provided below).

* `rebalanceID`.
A 32-bit string that is the identifier for the rebalance: for example, `"4f64c7dd5a1a452d3bcc3668307d64a6"`.

* `nodesInfo`.
Information on the nodes of the cluster, in relation to the rebalance.
The following objects are provided &#8212; each consists of an array of strings, each of which represents a node.
Where the category has no nodes, the array is empty.

** `active_nodes`.
The nodes included in the rebalance.

** `keep_nodes`.
The nodes that were intended to be part of the cluster, following rebalance.

** `eject_nodes`.
The nodes that were to be ejected by rebalance.

** `delta_nodes`.
The nodes on which Delta Recovery was to be performed.

** `failed_nodes`.
The nodes that were failed over prior to rebalance, and will be ejected from the cluster on successful rebalance.

* `master_node`.
The master node for the cluster, on which the _Master Services_ run &#8212; these are sometimes referred to as the _Orchestrator_.
If this node is rebalanced out of the cluster, a new Orchestrator is elected by the Cluster Manager, on a surviving node.
For further information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc#ns-server[ns-server].

* `completionMessage`.
A message that signifies the way in which rebalance ended.
For example, `"Rebalance completed successfully"`, or `"Rebalance stopped by user"`.

If the report is downloaded by means of Couchbase Web Console, additional information in provided, concerning the download.

[#standard-fields-example]
=== Standard Fields Example

The following example displays the initial section of a rebalance report, following a rebalance performed on a cluster consisting of the following nodes:

* `10.143.194.101`, running the Data, Query, and Index Services.

* `10.143.194.102`, running the Data and Search Services.

* `10.143.194.103`, running the Analytics and Eventing Services.

* `10.143.194.104`, running the Data Service.

The rebalance follows an edit made to both buckets resident on the cluster, `beer-sample` and `travel-sample`, changing the number of replicas from 1 to 2, for each.
This excerpt starts at the top of the structure, and stops at the point at which the Data Service `details` begin (these are described further below).

----

Each service thus has its stage-information provided in an object named after the service.
Progress is provided for the whole cluster, and per node.
Start times and completion times are provided, as are elapsed times.
The Data Service contains the additional object, `details`, which is described immediately below.

[#data-service-details]
== Data Service Details

The `details` provided for the Data Service are provided _per bucket_.
Therefore, if the cluster contains the buckets `travel-sample` and `bucket-sample`, the `details` object provides a correspondingly named structure for each.

The structure for each bucket may provide:

* `compactionInfo`.
Information on compaction, if it is performed for the bucket.
If compaction is not performed, the `compactionInfo` structure is _not_ provided.
If the `compactionInfo` structure _is_ provided, it gives the `averageTime` required for the bucket's compaction, _per node_, in milliseconds.

* `vbucketLevelInfo`.
Information on the _phases_ whereby the vBuckets were moved during rebalance.
If no vBucket movement occurred, the `vbucketLevelInfo` structure is _not_ provided.
If the `vbucketLevelInfo` structure _is_ provided, it includes the following:

** Fields that provide the `averageTime` for the `move`, `backfill`, `takeover`, and `persistence` phases for the bucket.
For an explanation of these terms, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#rebalancing-the-data-service[Rebalance and the Data Service].
Times are provided in milliseconds, to fourteen decimal places.
The `totalCount` of vBuckets and `remainingCount` are also provided for the `move` phase: in a completed report, the `remainingCount` is expected to be zero.

** `vbucketInfo`.
Detailed information for each _moved_ vbucket that corresponds to the specified bucket.
Note that vBuckets that were _not_ moved are not included.
The information is as follows:

*** `id`.
The vBucket id, which is an integer between 0 and 1023 (or on MacOS, between 0 and 63).

*** `beforeChain`.
The _chain_ that this vBucket was part of, prior to rebalance.
Each chain consists of one or more nodes, on each of which was located a vBucket containing an identical set of documents; one of the vBuckets being the _active_ vBucket, and the others (if other nodes are indeed specified) being the _replica_ vBuckets.
The `beforeChain` is specified as an array of strings, each of which specifies a node; in the form `"ns_1@10.143.194.101"`.
The first node in the list is the _master_ node, on which was located the active vBucket: any additional nodes in the list each hosted a replica vBucket.

*** `afterChain`
The chain of which this vBucket is a part, following rebalance.

*** `move`.
The `startTime` and `completedTime` for the move process that occurred, specified in each case as a UTC date/time string; plus the `timeTaken` for the move, in milliseconds.

*** `backfill`, `takeover`, and `persistence` information, specified in the same way as the `move` information.

*** `replicationInfo`.
Node status-changes that have occurred due to rebalance.
An object is provided for each node on which the vBucket has been promoted from replica to active, or has received mutations, or has been created.
For each affected node, the `node` is identified, and its `inDocsTotal` (number of documents received or mutated) and `inDocsLeft` (number of documents still to be received or mutated) are specified, as integers.

=== Data Service Details Example

The following example provides part of the `details` section from the rebalance report described above, in xref:rebalance-reference:rebalance-reference.adoc#stage-info-standard-field-example[Standard Field Example].
General information is provided on the `beer-sample` bucket, and specific information for the `beer-sample` vBucket whose id is `0`.

      .
      .
      .
----

The `compactionInfo` object contains the average time taken for compaction _per node_.
The `vbucketLevelInfo` object provides an overall `averageTime` for each phase whereby vBuckets were moved, during rebalance.

The `vbucketInfo` section provides a sequence of objects, one for each vBucket that was moved during rebalance.
In this example, only the first of these (id `0`) is shown.
The `beforeChain` indicates that prior to rebalance, the active vBucket resided on node `10.143.194.101`, with its single replica on node `10.143.194.102`.
The `afterChain` indicates that following rebalance, the active vBucket resides on node `10.143.194.102`, and the two replicas reside on nodes `10.143.194.101` and `10.143.194.104` respectively.

Date/time strings for `startTime` and `completedTime`, and an integer for `timeTaken`, are provided for each of the move stages for this vBucket.

The `replicationInfo` object shows that `10.143.194.192` has become the host for the active bucket; with no documents having needed to be moved onto this node &#8212; since they already resided there within a replica vBucket, which was promoted to active during rebalance.
It also shows that `9` documents were moved onto node `10.143.194.104` &#8212; since the rebalance process placed an additional replica there, in accordance with the pre-rebalance bucket-reconfiguration.
