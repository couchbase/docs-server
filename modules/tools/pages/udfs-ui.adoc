:description: The Couchbase Server admin console provides a UI for adding user defined functions.

[abstract]
{description}

Starting from Couchbase Server 7.1, the Couchbase Administration console provides an interface to create, update, or delete user-defined functions written in {sqlpp} or JavaScript.

Start at the administration console and select menu:Query[UDFs] from the menus to access the *UDF* screen.

== Javascript Function Libraries

Click on the `{plus}{nbsp}add function library` link to create a library of JavaScript functions.

When you create a new library, an example function (`add`) is supplied as an example. 
You can delete it when you add your own function, or leave it to serve as a basic example.

You can set a *Namespace* for your library which will restrict its access to users that have permissions to access the bucket and scope specified by the namespace.

Before you leave the screen, you must set a *Library Name*.

Click btn:[Save] to save the library and return to the main UDF screen, or btn:[Cancel] to cancel without saving the library.

You can *edit* the library again to add and/or delete functions contained inside it. 

You can also delete the whole library by clicking on the *drop* link.

== User-Defined Functions

You can add your own user-defined functions in the lower *User-Defined Functions* list.
These functions can be one of two types:

To add a user-defined function, click on *{plus}{nbsp}add function* below the *User-Defined Functions* list.

The *Namespace* can be set to define the scope that function resides in (`travel-sample.inventory` for example). 

Users will need permissions to access this namespace to run the function.

The *Function Name* is the name that will be used in {sqlpp} statements (`EXECUTE FUNCTION` for example) to reference your function.
The name must be unique and is case-insensitive.

You can define a list of fixed parameters for your function, or you can use the `...` symbol which indicates a variable length function list defined as `args[]`.

The *Function Type* can be either `inline` or `Javascript`:

[horizontal]
*Inline*:: This is a function written in {sqlpp} which can be used as part of another {sqlpp} statement, such as xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/selectintro.adoc[SELECT] and xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/execfunction.adoc[EXECUTE FUNCTION].

*JavaScript*:: You can create {sqlpp} functions that call the Javascript functions defined in your library.

If you are defining an `inline` function then you can fill in any valid {sqlpp} expression which can then be used as part of another {sqlpp} statement.
This is the default when creating a function.

If you switch *Function Type* to `Javascript` then the dialog will change to configure a JavaScript function call.

Then you select the `Javascript Library` where you created your Javascript function, and the name of your function. (There is no need to include the parameters.)

Once the details have been filled, you can click the btn:[Save Function] to save the function and exit the dialog, or click on btn:[Cancel] to exit the dialog without saving the details.
