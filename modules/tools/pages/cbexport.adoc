*Description*

Exports JSON data from Couchbase.
The [.cmd]`cbexport json` command supports exporting JSON documents to a file with a document on each line or a file that contains a JSON list where each element is a document.
The file format to export to can be specified with the `--format` flag.
See <<dataset-formats,Dataset Formats>> for more details on the supported file formats.

*Options*

The following tables list the required and optional parameters for the [.cmd]`cbexport json` command.

.Required options for cbexport json
[#table_thk_3q3_vy,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| -c,--cluster <url>
| The host name of a node in the cluster to export data from.
See <<topic_fsg_5d3_vx/host-formats-json,Host Formats>> for details about host name specification formats.

| -u,--username <username>
| The user name for cluster authentication.
The user must have the appropriate privileges to read the bucket from which data will be exported.

| -p,--password <password>
| The password for cluster authentication.
The user must have the appropriate privileges to read from the bucket from which data will be exported.
Specifying this option without a value will allow the user to type a non-echoed password to stdin.

| -b,--bucket <bucket_name>
| The name of the bucket to export data from.

| -f,--format <format>
| The format of the dataset specified (lines or list).
See <<dataset-formats,Dataset Formats>> for more details on the formats supported by [.cmd]`cbexport`.

| -o,--output <path>
| The path to the location of the file that JSON documents from Couchbase should be exported to.
This may be an absolute or relative path, but must point to a file.
The file does not have to exist when the command is invoked.

.Optional options for cbexport json
[#table_s21_mq3_vy,cols="100,197"]
|===
| Option | Description

| --include-key <key>
| Couchbase stores data as key value pairs where the value is a JSON document and the key is an identifier for retrieving that document.
By default [.cmd]`cbexport` will only export the value portion of the document.
If you wish to include the key in the exported document, then this option should be specified.
The value passed to this option should be the field name that the key is stored under.

| --no-ssl-verify
| Skips the SSL verification phase.
Specifying this flag will allow a connection using SSL encryption, but will not verify the identity of the server you connect to.
You are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack if you use this flag.
Either this flag or the `--cacert` flag must be specified when using an SSL encrypted connection.

| --cacert
| Specifies a CA certificate that will be used to verify the identity of the server being connecting to.
Either this flag or the `--no- ssl-verify` flag must be specified when using an SSL encrypted connection.

| -t,--threads <num>
| Specifies the number of concurrent clients to use when exporting data.
Fewer clients means exports will take longer, but there will be less cluster resources used to complete the export.
More clients means faster exports, but at the cost of more cluster resource usage.
This parameter defaults to 1 if it is not specified and it is recommended that this parameter is not set to be higher than the number of CPUs on the machine where the export is taking place.

| -l,--log-file
| Specifies a log file for writing debugging information about [.cmd]`cbexport` execution.
|===

*Host Formats*

When specifying a host for the [.cmd]`cbexport` command the following formats are expected:

[#ul_m5j_ns3_vy]
* `couchbase://<addr>`
* `<addr>:<port>`
* `http://<addr>:<port>`

We recommend using the `couchbase://<addr>` format for standard installations.
The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which is needed for non-default installations where the admin port has been set up on a port other that 8091.

*Dataset Formats*

The cbexport command supports the following formats:

[#ul_frg_4sj_vx]
* *Lines*
+
The lines format specifies a file that contains one JSON document on every line in the file.
This format is specified by setting the `--format` option to "lines".
Here's an example of a file in lines format:
+
----
{"key": "mykey1", "value": "myvalue1"}
{"key": "mykey2", "value": "myvalue2"}
{"key": "mykey3", "value": "myvalue3"}
{"key": "mykey4", "value": "myvalue4"}
----

* *List*
+
The list format specifies a file which contains a JSON list where each element in the list is a JSON document.
The file may only contain a single list, but the list may be specified over multiple lines.
This format is specified by setting the `--format` option to "list".
Here's an example of a file in list format:
+
----
[
  {
    "key": "mykey1",
    "value": "myvalue1"
  },
  {"key": "mykey2", "value": "myvalue2"},
  {"key": "mykey3", "value": "myvalue3"},
  {"key": "mykey4", "value": "myvalue4"}
]
----

*Examples*

To export data to /data/lines.json using the lines format and running with 4 threads the following command can be run.

 $ cbexport json -c couchbase://127.0.0.1 -u Administrator -p password \
           -b default -o /data/lines.json -f lines -t 4

To export data from /data/list.json using the list format the following command can be run.

 $ cbexport json -c couchbase://127.0.0.1 -u Administrator -p password \
            -b default -o /data/list.json -f list
