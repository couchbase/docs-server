= Accessing data from a command line

[abstract]
The Couchbase command line client, [.cmd]`cbc`, is part of the C SDK.
The most common form of installation is via the Couchbase software repositories, though it can also be built from source or downloaded directly.

== Installing cbc on Linux

To install [.cmd]`cbc` on Linux, you can use a simple Perl setup script that automatically configures your system to use the Couchbase software repositories.
Use the following commands to download and execute this script (as root or using sudo):

 $ wget http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/c/couchbase-csdk-setup
 $ perl couchbase-csdk-setup

== Installing cbc on OS X

 $ brew install libcouchbase

== Running the client

The command-line client contains subcommands that perform various operations on the server.
The basic commands are:

[#ul_xn5_nhm_zs]
* `cbc create` (create/update documents)
* `cbc cat` (retrieve a document)
* `cbc n1ql` (execute a query)
* `cbc rm` (remove a document).

To point the client at a cluster, provide one of the cluster nodes using the -U argument:

 $ cbc cat document_id -U couchbase://10.0.0.31

== Command symbolic links

On Unix-like platforms, shortcuts for the various subcommands are available in the form of _cbc-<command>_.
For example, the following commands to retrieve an item are equivalent:

----
cbc cat foo
----

----
cbc-cat foo
----

The symbolic link works well with your shell's tab completion features to help you discover new commands.

== Documents

== Storing a document

The document to be stored can be supplied on the command line using the `-V` parameter.
If the document is large or is the result of another program's output, `cbc-create` can also read the document from standard input.

 $ cbc-create document_id -V '{"json":"value"}'

 $ echo '{"json":"value"}' | cbc-create document_id

== Retrieving a document

The output of the command contains the actual document value on `stdout` and any metadata/error information on `stderr`.

 $ cbc-cat document_id
 document_id          CAS=0xe0004ea40100, Flags=0x0. Size=16
 {"json":"value"}

== Issuing N1QL queries

NOTE: Ensure the string is properly escaped for the shell.
It is best to place the query string in single quotes; this way the shell does not recognize double-quotes or backticks, which are often used in N1QL queries

 $ cbc-n1ql 'SELECT airportname, city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type="airport" LIMIT 2'

 $ cbc-n1ql 'SELECT airportname, city FROM `travel-sample` WHERE faa=$faa' --qarg faa='"RNO"'

== Other commands

There are many other subcommands available with [.cmd]`cbc`.
Use `cbc help` to see the full listing.
