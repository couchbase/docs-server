= Removing documents

[abstract]
Over the lifespan of your database, you will need to remove documents.

----
cb.remove(docid)
----

Removing documents can be done using the [.api]`remove()` function.

The removal operation can optionally be supplied with a xref:cas-concurrency.adoc#concept_iq4_bts_zs[CAS] value, ensuring that if the document has since been modified by another client instance, the removal operation will fail.
