[abstract]
{description}
 
 
SDK doctor is a tool to diagnose application-server-side connectivity issues with your Couchbase Cluster.
It makes the same connections to the Couchbase Server cluster that Couchbase SDKs make during bootstrapping, and then reports on the state of the connections made -- giving diagnostic information that can help to solve puzzling network issues.
 
Couchbase SDKs work best when on the same local area network as your Couchbase Server cluster.
Developing locally, against a remote cluster -- particularly a Cloud-hosted one -- can lead to timeout problems.
SDK doctor is particularly useful for diagnosing such network problems.


== Installation

Binaries can be found on the https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor/releases[Releases page].
The latest release is https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor/releases/tag/v1.0.8[1.0.8].

Whether you use the binary from a local directory, or place somewhere in your `$PATH`, do not forget to adjust permissions to make it runnable:

[source,console]
----
$ chmod u+x sdk-doctor-linux
----

////
The build steps are similar to most go programs.  
Given a properly set up go build environment:

[source,console]
----
$ go get github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
----

[source,console]
----
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
----

[source,console]
----
$ go build
----

[source,console]
----
$ ./sdk-doctor  diagnose --help
----
 
[TIP]
====
If the `cd` of the second step returns an error because your `GOPATH` is not correctly set, you will probably find that it has defaulted to ~.
So:
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~/go/src/github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-doctor
----
====
////

== Use

Run SDK doctor with your credentials, and the cluster and bucket:
[source,console]
----
$ ./sdk-doctor-macos diagnose couchbases://e9718149-af24-4bc4-b496-53149cdb7966.dp.cloud.couchbase.com/travel-sample -u username -p password
----

You should see results like there (truncated here):
[source,console]
----
$ ./sdk-doctor-macos diagnose couchbases://e9718149-af24-4bc4-b496-53149cdb7966.dp.cloud.couchbase.com/travel-sample -u username -p 2KZZb3pap89£$$%\*

Note: Diagnostics can only provide accurate results when your cluster
 is in a stable state.  Active rebalancing and other cluster configuration
 changes can cause the output of the doctor to be inconsistent or in the
 worst cases, completely incorrect.

== Limitations

Warnings about canonical node hostnames may appear if the system under test is using Alternate Addresses (as Couchbase Cloud does), and are safe to ignore.
