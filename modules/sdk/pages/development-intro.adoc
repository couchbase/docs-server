== Using Couchbase

Once you've xref:install:install-intro.adoc[installed the server], and xref:clustersetup:create-bucket.adoc[created a test bucket], you can start storing, retrieving, and querying documents with Couchbase.
You can start with an SDK, the command-line cbc tool, or the web browser.

Every item in a database goes through the basic _CRUD_ cycle, which is typical of an application’s use of data.
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete:

* **C**reate: when data is first inserted into the cluster
* **R**ead: when an application retrieves the data
* **U**pdate: when data is modified to reflect a change in the state represented by the data
* **D**elete: when the data is no longer needed

The following examples use the xref:2.7@java-sdk::webui-cli-access.adoc#cli-access[CLI] interface to demonstrate the basic CRUD operations.
If you don’t know how to use or install the command line client, don’t worry - we’ll walk through the steps in the next chapter.

== Creating documents

Create the document _josmith.json_.
It can be anywhere on your file system:

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "Jo Smith",
    "email": "jo.smith@example.com",
    "privs": ["admin"],
    "location": {
        "country": "United States",
        "state": "NV",
        "city": "Reno"
    },
    "following": [
        "u:asmith", "u:bsmith", "u:potus"
    ],
    "likes": ["dogs", "pastries"]
}
----

Now, insert the document into Couchbase using the _cbc_ utility:

 $ cbc create -u username -P password -U couchbase://hostname-or-ip/myTestBucket --mode insert josmith < josmith.json

`josmith` is the document’s ID, which is redirected (`<`) to the [.cmd]`cbc` command’s standard input.

== Reading documents by ID

Documents can be retrieved using their IDs.
Retrieving a document by ID is extremely fast.
The following query takes about 1 millisecond.

 $ cbc cat -u username -P password -U couchbase://hostname-or-ip/josmith
 {
     "name": "Jo Smith",
     "email": "jo.smith@example.com",
     "privs": ["admin"],
     "location": {
         "country": "United States",
         "state": "NV",
         "city": "Reno"
     },
     "following": [
         "u:asmith", "u:bsmith", "u:potus"
     ],
     "likes": ["dogs", "pastries"]
 }

== Reading documents by querying

Retrieving a document may be done using a unique identifier assigned by the application at the document’s creation, or by inspecting its contents to see if it matches a certain criterion.
ID lookups are quicker, but querying documents allows for richer search capabilities (for example, "Give me all likes and followed users located in the US" versus "Give me a user with the ID e3d882a4").

 $ cbc n1ql \
   'SELECT following, likes FROM default WHERE location.country = "United States"'
        {
             "following": [
                 "u:asmith",
                 "u:bsmith",
                 "u:potus"
             ],
             "likes": [
                 "dogs",
                 "pastries"
             ]

== Updating documents

Updating a document means changing the existing document.
For example, take the file above and edit the `likes` field:

....
    ...
    "likes": ["dogs", "pastries", "couchbase"]
    ....
....

Then use the [.cmd]`cbc` tool to update the document in Couchbase:

 $ cbc create --mode replace josmith < josmith.json

== Deleting documents

This example shows how to delete the document with the ID `josmith`.

 $ cbc rm josmith

== Couchbase clients

Clients access data by connecting to a Couchbase cluster over the network.
The most common type of client is a Couchbase SDK, which is a full programmatic API that enables applications to take the best advantage of Couchbase.
The command line client provides a quick and streamlined interface for simple access and is suitable if you just want to access an item without writing any code.
