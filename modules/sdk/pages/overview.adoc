.C SDK

[.content]
The Couchbase C SDK (`libcouchbase`) enables C and C++ programs to access a Couchbase Server cluster.
The C SDK is also commonly used as a core dependency of SDKs written in other language to provide a common implementation and high performance.
Libcouchbase also contains the `cbc` suite of command line tools.
