[abstract]
Couchbase offers numerous software development kits (SDKs) that provide programmatic access to Couchbase Server.

xref:3.0@c-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[C SDK 3.0] ::
The Couchbase C SDK (`libcouchbase`) enables C and C++ programs to access a Couchbase Server cluster.
The C SDK is also commonly used as a core dependency of SDKs written in other language to provide a common implementation and high performance.

xref:3.0@dotnet-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[.NET SDK 3.0] ::
The .NET SDK enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from the .NET Framework using C#.
It offers both a traditional synchronous API and an asynchronous API based on the Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP).

xref:2.0@go-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Go SDK 2.0] ::
The Couchbase Go SDK allows you to connect to a Couchbase Server cluster from Go.
The Go SDK is a native Go library and uses the high-performance gocbcore to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase's binary protocols.

xref:3.0@java-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Java SDK 3.0] ::
The Java SDK allows Java applications to access a Couchbase Server cluster.
The Java SDK offers traditional synchronous APIs as well as scalable asynchronous APIs to maximize performance.

xref:3.0@nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Node.js SDK 3.0] ::
The Node.js SDK allows you to connect to a Couchbase Server cluster from Node.js.
The Node.js SDK is a native Node.js module using the very fast `libcouchbase` library to handle communicating with the cluster over the Couchbase binary protocol.

xref:3.0@php-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[PHP SDK 3.0] ::
The PHP SDK allows you to connect to a Couchbase Server cluster from PHP.
The PHP SDK is a native PHP extension and uses the Couchbase high-performance C library `libcouchbase` to handle communicating to the cluster over Couchbase binary protocols.

xref:3.0@python-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Python SDK 3.0] ::
The Python SDK allows Python applications to access a Couchbase Server cluster.
The Python SDK offers a traditional synchronous API as well as integration with twisted, gevent, and asyncio.
It depends on the C SDK (`libcouchbase`) and utilizes it for performance and reliability.

xref:1.0@scala-sdk::start-using-sdk.adoc[Scala SDK 1.0] ::
Our new Scala SDK allows Scala applications to access a Couchbase Server cluster.
