= Archive Layout
:page-aliases: backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-archivelayout

[abstract]
The backup archive layout specification.

== Specification

The backup archive is used to store all backup data and the layout format is
detailed below. The top level directory of the archive is called the archive
backup. The backup archive will contain one or more backup repositories and a
logs directory. The logs directory will contain logging information for all
cbbackupmgr commands run on the backup archive. Each backup repository will
contain backups for a specific cluster and each backup is done on a cluster
incrementally. All backups in a backup repository will be names with a
timestamp that corresponds to the time it was
taken. Since backups are taken incrementally this timestamp will always be
increasing. When a backup is taken it will use the backup configuration
(backup-meta.json) in the specified backup repository to retrieve
information for how the backup should be taken. If multiple buckets are
specified to be backed up then there wil be separate bucket backup folders
created for each bucket that is backed up.

== File Descriptions

* *backup-meta.json*
+
This file is used to store the backup configuration for a backup repository.
Each time a backup is run it will read these options, connect to the
cluster, and backup data from the point where it last left off. All
parameters in this file are specified when creating the backup repository.
The backup configuration file will contain data that looks something like
the example below.

----
{
  "configuration": {
    "exclude_buckets": [],
    "only_include_buckets": ["bucket-1", "bucket-2"],
    "exclude_collections": [],
    "only_include_collections": [],
    "key_filter": "",
    "value_filter": "",
    "disable_cluster_config": true,
    "disable_bucket_config": false,
    "disable_views": false,
    "disable_gsi_indexes": false,
    "disable_queries": true,
    "disable_ft_indexes": false,
    "disable_data": false,
    "allow_bucket_creation": false
  }
}
----

* *bucket-config.json*
+
This file will contain a backup of the bucket configuration for the specified
bucket. All bucket configuration parameters are stored in this file except for the bucket password.

* *views.json*
+
This file will contain a backup of all design documents and views in a
particular bucket.

* *full-text.json*
+
This file will contain a backup of all full text indexes in a particular bucket.

* *shard-*.fdb*
+
These are forestdb files that contain the cluster data. The amount of
shards will depend on the amount of clients used during the backup.
The amount of client is is specified with the ``--threads` flag in the
`cbbackupmgr-backup` command.
