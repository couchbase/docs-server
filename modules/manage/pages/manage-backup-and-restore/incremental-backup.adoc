= Incremental Backup and Restore
:page-aliases: backup-restore:incremental-backup

[abstract]
The `cbbackup` and `cbrestore` tools perform incremental backup, enabling
administrators to quickly back up only the modified data in the database.
This makes incremental backup and restore more efficient for larger data sets.

The purpose of an incremental backup is to back up only the data that has
changed since the previous backup. Incremental backups provide the following
benefits:

* More options for backup strategies.

* Greater flexibility in the restoration process.

* Reduce the amount of time needed for daily backups.

* Reduce the amount of disk storage needed for backups.

* Reduce bandwidth usage when backing up over a network.

When you need to recover data, the restoration process uses the last full
backup and one or more incremental backups. You can restore data either
beginning with a specified date or ending with a specified date. For more
information, see the Couchbase CLI cbbackup and cbrestore commands.

In addition to full backups, Couchbase Server offers the following types of
incremental backups:

* Differential incremental backup

* Cumulative incremental backup

== Differential Incremental Backup

Differential incremental backups contain only the database changes that
occurred since the last backup. Differential backups are created quickly because
less data is backed up, but restorations from differential backups take longer
than restorations from cumulative incremental backups.

The following figure shows an example of a differential incremental backup
strategy. Every Sunday, a full backup is made. On the other days of the
week, a differential incremental backup is made.

In this example, the Monday backup contains the changes made since the full
backup on Sunday, the Tuesday backup contains the changes made since the Monday
backup, the Wednesday backup contains the changes made since the Tuesday backup,
and so on. For example, a restore operation performed on Wednesday uses the full
backup from Sunday and the differential incremental backups from Monday and
Tuesday.

== Cumulative Incremental Backup

Cumulative incremental backups contain all changes that occurred since the last
full backup.
Restorations from cumulative backups are faster than restorations from
differential
backups, but cumulative backups require a longer backup window and use more disk
space than differential backups.

The following figure shows an example of a cumulative incremental backup
strategy. Every Sunday, a full backup is made. On the other days of the week,
a cumulative incremental backup is made.

In this example, the Monday backup contains all the changes made since the full
backup on Sunday, the Tuesday backup contains all the changes made since the full
backup on Sunday, the Wednesday backup contains all the changes made since the
full backup on Sunday, and so on. For example, a restore operation performed on
Wednesday uses the full backup from Sunday and the cumulative incremental
backup from Tuesday.

== Combining Incremental Backup Types

For greater flexibility in the restoration process, your backup strategy can
include a combination of differential and cumulative incremental backups.

The following figure shows an example of a backup strategy that incorporates
both differential and cumulative backups. Every Sunday, a full backup is made.
For the remainder of the week, depending on the day, either a differential or
cumulative incremental backup is made.

In this example, the backup schedule includes differential and cumulative
incremental backups on different days. On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday a differential incremental backup is made. On Thursday, a
cumulative incremental backup is made. For example, a restore operation
performed on Saturday uses the full backup from Sunday, the cumulative
incremental backup from Thursday, and the differential incremental backup
from Friday.
