[#understanding-backup-and-restore]
== Understanding Backup and Restore

The data on a Couchbase-Server cluster can be backed up, restored, and archived by means of either of the following:

* The *Backup Service*.
This can be configured by means of the *Backup* UI provided by Couchbase Web Console.

* The xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr] CLI utility.

The technology that underlies the Backup Service includes that provided by `cbbackupmgr`: note, however, that `cbbackupmgr` and the Backup Service differ, in terms of the features they offer (as described below, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#the-backup-service-and-cbbackupmgr[The Backup Service and cbbackupmgr]).

Note that two additional tools, xref:cli:cbtools/cbbackup.adoc[cbbackup] and xref:cli:cbtools/cbrestore.adoc[cbrestore], continue to be available as of Couchbase Server 7.0: however, both are deprecated.

Detailed information on `cbbackupmgr` is provided in xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr].
An overview of the Backup Service is provided in xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc[Backup Service].

[#the-backup-service-and-cbbackupmgr]
=== The Backup Service and cbbackupmgr

Both the Backup Service and `cbbackupmgr` are included in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
Note that from version 7.0, `cbbackupmgr` is also available in Community Edition, but without support for merge, cloud backup, or collection-level restore.

The following paragraphs summarize the similarities and differences between the Backup Service and `cbbackupmgr` as provided by Enterprise Edition.

For use of the Backup Service, the Full Admin role must have been assigned.
For use of `cbbackupmgr`, the Full Admin or the Data Backup & Restore role must have been assigned.

The Backup Service &#8212; which can be configured by means of the *Backup* facility of Couchbase Web Console, the Couchbase CLI, and the REST API &#8212; allows backup, restore, and archiving to be configured for the local cluster; and also permits restore to be configured for a remote cluster.
By contrast, `cbbackupmgr` allows backup, restore, and archiving each to be configured either for the local or for a remote cluster: all available options are listed in xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc##version-compatibility[Version Compatibility].

Whereas `cbbackupmgr` performs a specific backup or merge when executed, the Backup Service can be _scheduled_; so that backups and periodic merges are ongoing.
The Backup Service therefore supports additional and modified parameters, to allow scheduling to be configured.

Note that both the Backup Service and `cbbackupmgr` allow _full_ and _incremental_ backups.
Unlike the Backup Service, `cbbackupmgr` requires a new repository to be created for each new, full backup (successive `cbbackupmgr` backups to the same repository being incremental).
Both allow incremental backups, once created, to be merged, and their data deduplicated.
Both use the same backup archive structure; allow the contents of backups to be listed; and allow specific documents to be searched for.

Both the Backup Service and `cbbackupmgr` support use of AWS S3 storage.

Note that `cbbackupmgr` is available in both Couchbase Server 7.0 Enterprise Edition (_EE_) and 7.0 Community Edition (_CE_).
However, whereas in EE, `cbbackupmgr` allows backup and restore to be performed with reference to buckets, scopes, and collections; in CE, `cbbackupmgr` allows backup and restore to be performed with reference to buckets only.

For detailed information on how `cbbackupmgr` works (including a detailed description of incremental backup), see the xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc#discussion[Discussion] provided on the page for xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr].
The page for xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr] also provides a synopsis of the command, and a description of its basic options.

The remainder of the current page describes how to configure and use the Backup Service, using Couchbase Web Console.

[#node-configuration]
== Assign and Run the Backup Service

For backup, restore, and other related tasks to be scheduled and performed, the Backup Service must be running on an assigned node.
The service (as is the case with all other Couchbase services) can be assigned either when a node is initially provisioned as a one-node cluster (as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster]), or when a node is added to an existing cluster (as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance]).
Provided that at least one node runs the Backup Service, data for the entire cluster can be backed up, restored, and archived.
Locations to be used for saving data must be accessible to all cluster-nodes that are running the Backup Service.
Note also that Couchbase Server must have _read_ and _write_ access to the location.
On Linux, therefore, for a filesystem location, use the `chgrp` command to set the group ID of the folder to `couchbase`; unless a _non-root installation_ has been performed, in which case set the group ID either to the username of the current user, or to a group of which the current user is a member &#8212; see xref:install:non-root.adoc[Non-Root Install and Upgrade], for more information.

[#access-the-backup-service-ui]
== Access the Backup Service UI

To access the Backup Service UI, proceed as follows:

. On Couchbase Web Console, left-click on the *Backup* tab, in the right-hand, vertical navigation bar:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/accessBackupTab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Backup* screen.
The initial appearance is as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/backupScreenInitial.png[,720,align=left]
+
The *Backup* screen features two tabs, located on the upper, horizontal navigation bar: these are *Repositories* and *Plans*.
By default, the *Repositories* tab is selected: the corresponding, *Repositories* view features three panels, for *Active*, *Imported*, and *Archived* repositories respectively.
Currently, all panels are blank.

[#schedule-backups]
== Schedule Backups

The Backup Service allows backups (and merges) to be scheduled, as _tasks_.
This section describes how task-definition and scheduling can be accomplished.
Note that for any given repository, the Backup Service performs one task at a time; with each task maintaining a lock on the repository.
Therefore, the administrator-defined interval between tasks should always be sufficient to allow each task to run to completion.
If a new task is scheduled to start while a previously started task is still running, the new task cannot run.
For information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc#avoiding-task-overlap[Avoiding Task Overlap].

To schedule one or more backups, proceed as follows:

. Choose to add a _repository_.
When fully defined, the repository will combine the definitions of one or more backup and related activities, scheduled for one or more buckets, targeted at a storage location accessible to all nodes on the cluster.
Each repository must have a name unique among repositories on the cluster.
+
To add a repository, left-click on the *ADD REPOSITORY* tab, at the upper right of the screen:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/addRepositoryTab.png[,140,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Select Plan* dialog, which initially appears as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/selectPlanDialog.png[,420,align=left]

. Specify whether to use a default or a custom plan.
A _plan_ determines what kind of backup is to occur, affecting what data, and on what schedule.
Predefined plans are provided, named *_hourly_backups* and *_daily_backups*: as their names indicate, these provide backups that are respectively hourly and daily.
The *_hourly_backups* plan appears as the default selection.
+
(For more information, see xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#default-plans[Default Plans], below.)
+
Left-click on the control that appears at the right-hand side of the *Select plan* dialog's interactive text-field.
A pull-down menu appears, as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/selectPlanDialogPullDownMenuInitial.png[,420,align=left]
+
Three options are thus provided.
The first two are *_daily_backups* and *_hourly_backups*.
The third option is *+ Create new plan*: select this option:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/selectPlanDialogPullDownMenuSelection.png[,140,align=left]
+
This establishes the string *+ Create new plan* within the interactive text field; and modifies the *Select Plan* dialog to appear as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/selectPlanDialog2.png[,420,align=left]

. Create a custom plan.
In the *Name* field of the *Select Plan* dialog, enter a name for the plan that is to be created.
The name must be unique across the cluster, can only use the characters `[`, `]`, `A` to `Z`, `a` to `z`, `&#95;` and `-`; and must not start with either `&#95;` or `-`.
+
Then, optionally, add a description for the plan in the *Description* field: the description can be up to 140 characters in length.
For example, to specify a plan for hourly backups, the following might be entered:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createPlanDialogWithInitialInput.png[,420,align=left]
+
Next, specify the services for which data will be backed up.
Left-click on the *Services* control: this expands the dialog, and displays a complete list of Couchbase Services, each being accompanied by a checkbox.
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createPlanServicesListInitial.png[,90,align=left]
+
To specify that only data for the Data and Index Services should be backed up, uncheck the boxes for all the other services.
+
Next, to specify precise details of what should occur when the backup is run, left-click on the *Add Task* control.
The dialog now expands, to reveal the following fields:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createPlanDialogAddTaskFields.png[,420,align=left]
+
The fields permit the input of data to specify the details of a particular task.
Note that the dialog permits multiple tasks to be specified, by additional left-clickings of the *Add Task* control; and allows tasks selectively to be removed, by left-clickings of the *Remove Task* control.
+
In the *Name* field, enter an appropriate name for the task: for example, *hourlyBackup*.
+
The *Period* field allows specification of the frequency of the task.
If the default selection, *Weekly Calendar*, is chosen, this specifies a daily backup according to details added lower in the panel for the task.
Alternatively, to choose a specific frequency, access the control at the right-hand of the *Period* field.
A pull-down menu appears:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/periodPullDownMenu.png[,420,align=left]
+
From the pull-down menu, select *Hours*, to indicate that the frequency should be determined in units of hours.
(Note that this duly removes from the dialog the day-specification controls associated with *Weekly Calendar*.)
+
In the *Start Time* field, specify a time of day at which the task is to be run.
The time of day must be specified as hours and minutes, separated by a colon.
Note that when the frequency-unit specified is *Minutes*, this field takes no input.
When the frequency-unit specified is *Hours* (as is the case in the current example), only the numbers signifying minutes (those after the colon) are used.
To ensure that the hourly task is performed on the hour, leave these numbers as *00*.
+
In the *Type* field, specify the task to be performed, by accessing the control at the right-hand side of the field.
This displays the following pull-down menu:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/typePullDownMenu.png[,420,align=left]
+
Select *Backup*, from the pull-down menu.
Then, in the *Frequency* field, specify the frequency with which the task should be performed.
The field only accepts integers: these must be between 1 and 200 inclusive.
To specify that the task be performed hourly, enter *1*.
+
(Note that an overview of all options for task-scheduling is provided below, in the section xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#review-scheduling-options[Review Scheduling Options].)
+
To complete specification of the task, determine whether the backup to be performed is *Full* or *Incremental*.
If it is to be *Full*, check the *Full Backup* checkbox.
If it is to be *Incremental* (as should be the case in the current example), leave the checkbox unchecked.
+
The dialog now appears as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/taskPanelComplete.png[,420,align=left]
+
At this stage, if another task is to be specified, the *Add Task* control should be clicked on: this expands the dialog further, and provides another set of task-specification fields.
If the task already added is to be removed, left-click on the *Cancel* button: this discards the data that has been added for the task, and closes the task-panel.
If the specification of the plan is to be abandoned, left-click on the *Cancel* tab, at the lower right.
If the specification for the task is to be retained and used, and no other task is to be specified (as is the case in the current example), left-click on the *Next* button:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/nextButton.png[,130,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Create Repository* dialog, which appears as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createRepositoryDialogInitial.png[,420,align=left]

. Create a repository.
Enter data into the *Create Repository* dialog.
+
The *ID* should be a name for the repository.
The name must be unique across the cluster, can only use the characters `[`, `]`, `A` to `Z`, `a` to `z`, `&#95;` and `-`; and must not start with either `&#95;`, `-`, `[`, or `]`.
For example, `hourlyBackupRepo`.
+
The *Bucket* should be the name of either a _Couchbase_ or an _Ephemeral_ bucket, whose data is to be backed up.
Selection can be made with a pull-down menu, accessed by means of the control at the right of the field.
If a bucket-name is selected, only data from this bucket is backed up.
If the default selection, *All buckets*, is used, data from all buckets on the cluster (including all Couchbase and all Ephemeral buckets) is backed up.
+
Use the control at the right-hand side of the field, to select a bucket.
For the current example, the sample bucket `travel-sample` is assumed to have been installed (see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets]); and will be specified in this field.
+
The value for *Storage Locations* can be specified as *Filesystem* (the default) or *Cloud*.
For the current example, *Filesystem* will be used.
Note that if *Cloud* is selected, allowing AWS S3 storage to be used, the dialog expands, and displays additional options: these are described below, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#use-cloud-storage[Use Cloud Storage].
+
The *Location* should be the location of the storage-based archive for the repository.
If on the local filesystem, this location must be a pathname accessible to all nodes within the cluster that are running the Backup Service: which is to say, reads from and writes to the location are shared through an NFS mount (or through some other type of shared-folder technology, such as Samba).
Couchbase Server must have _read_ and _write_ access to the location.
On Linux, therefore, for a filesystem location, use the `chgrp` command to set the group ID of the folder to `couchbase`; unless a _non-root installation_ has been performed, in which case set the group ID either to the username of the current user, or to a group of which the current user is a member.
+
When complete, the dialog may look as follows:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createRepositoryDialogComplete.png[,420,align=left]
+
To confirm, left-click on the *Add* button:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/addButton.png[,120,align=left]

This concludes the process for creating repository and plan.
The *Backup* screen now appears as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/newRepository.png[,720,align=left]

The newly created repository, *hourlyBackupRepo*, is thus displayed with its associated plan, `HourlyBackupPlan`, with the affected bucket (`travel-sample`) and the next scheduled backup displayed.
Data Service and Index Service data for `travel-sample` will now be backed up to the specified location on the specified schedule.

A repository whose plan is being executed (with data thereby backed up repeatedly, on schedule) is referred to as an _active_ repository.

[#run-an-immediate-backup]
== Run an Immediate Backup

By means of the Backup Service, an _immediate_ backup can be run: this eliminates the need to wait for a scheduled backup to run at an appointed time.
To run an immediate backup, access the *Backup* screen, and left-click on the row for an already-defined, active repository.
For example:

image::manage-backup-restore/selectActiveRepository.png[,720,align=left]

This causes the row to expand vertically, as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/activeRepositoryRowExpanded.png[,720,align=left]

A number of buttons now appear, arranged horizontally across the bottom of the row, permitting a variety of actions.
To perform an immediate backup, left-click on the *Run Backup* button:

image::manage-backup-restore/runBackupButton.png[,120,align=left]

This displays the *Trigger Backup* dialog, which appears as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/triggerBackup.png[,420,align=left]

The immediate backup to be performed will be _incremental_ by default.
To perform a _full_ backup, check the *Perform a full backup* checkbox.

Left-click on the *Backup* button, at the lower right of the dialog.
The dialog disappears, and a notification is displayed at the lower left of the console:

image::manage-backup-restore/immediateBackupNotification.png[,220,align=left]

This duly indicates that an immediate backup has been triggered.

[#inspect-backups]
== Inspect Backups

Using Couchbase Web Console, the history of backups to a specified repository can be reviewed.
Left-click on the row of a repository, to expand it vertically.
Then, left-click on the *Inspect Backups* button:

image::manage-backup-restore/inspectBackupsButton.png[,240,align=left]

This displays the *Backup* facility's *Repository* screen, which appears as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/inspectBackupsScreen.png[,720,align=left]

The screen provides two possible views, which are *Tasks* and *Backups*: these can be selected by means of the buttons at the upper right:

image::manage-backup-restore/tasksAndBackupsButtons.png[,130,align=left]

The *Backups* view is selected by default.
(Note the left-clicking the *Tasks* button displays the *Tasks* view: this is the same display as that accessed by means of the *Tasks* button, from the expanded row on the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen; and is described in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#inspect-tasks[Inspect Tasks], below.)

The main, lower panel of the *Backups* view provides the ID of the repository (in this case, `83f3b752-78e6-49f8-a527-2844c30fbc75`) and its size (here, `235.551MiB`); and also provides a vertically arranged list of all backups that have occurred, with the earliest at the top.
Each backup has its own row; with its start-time, type (_full_ or _incremental_), and size.
To inspect a particular backup in detail, left-click on the control at the left-hand side of the row:

image::manage-backup-restore/examineBackup.png[,360,align=left]

This causes the row to expand vertically:

image::manage-backup-restore/examineBackupExpanded.png[,720,align=left]

The displayed data includes the UUID for the source cluster.
Also specified are the numbers of *Eventing Functions* written for the Eventing Service, and the number of *Full Text Search Aliases* for the Search Service (here, the numbers are both zero).

Each bucket that has been backed up (in this case, the `travel-sample` bucket alone), appears on its assigned row in a table that specifies its size; along with the number of items, mutations, and tombstones that have been included in the backup.
The row also lists the numbers of backed up indexes for the Index, Search, and Analytics Services; and the number of backed up Views.
Additionally, in a searchable sub-panel, each _scope_ that the bucket contains is individually listed (these here being the _default_ and _inventory_ scopes, and four _tenant_agent_ scopes); with the number of mutations and tombstones listed, per scope.

To inspect the individual collections within a displayed scope, left-click on the row for the scope.
The row expands vertically, as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/examineBackupExpandedScope.png[,720,align=left]

Thus, left-clicking on the row for the `inventory` scope has displayed the individual collections within the scope; and thereby shows the mutations and tombstones for each collection.
Collections can be searched for, based on strings entered into the *filter collections* field, which is located to the upper right of the collections panel.

The upper panel of the *Data* screen provides interactive fields labelled *Key* and *Search Path*.
These can be used to search for a specific document within the repository.
Optionally, the subset of backups within the repository can be specified, by means of the *Start* and *End* fields.
For example, by accessing the control at the left-hand side of the *Start* field, a pull-down menu is displayed: this lists backups any one of which can be used as the starting point for the search:

image::manage-backup-restore/specifyStartingBackupForSearch.png[,280,align=left]

For example, type a known document key into the *Key* field &#8212; such as `airline_10`.
Then, enter the bucket name into the *Search Path* field: note that this requires explicit specification of both _scope_ and _collection_; unless default scope and collection have been used, in which case, explicit specification of the defaults is optional &#8212; for example, `travel-sample._default._default`.

When a search is expressed to include all backups of the bucket for the `inventory` scope and `airline` collection, the panels appear as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/searchPanelsForKeyAndBucket.png[,720,align=left]

To run the search, left-click on the *Examine* button.
The *Examine* screen is now displayed:

image::manage-backup-restore/examineScreen.png[,720,align=left]

Note that the controls adjacent to the *Diff* button, near the top of the screen, allow different backups to be selected, so that the differences between the document-versions they contain can be individually examined:

image::manage-backup-restore/diffSelector.png[,420,align=left]

The specified document is thereby shown, in the left and right-hand panels of the main display, in versions that respectively correspond to the backups selected.
When a field has changed, the earlier version appears shaded red, the later shaded green.

By default, a *Side-by-Side Diff* view of the specified document is shown.
To display an *Inline Diff* view, access the control at the upper right of the screen:

image::manage-backup-restore/diffView.png[,120,align=left]

The *Inline Diff* view is now provided:

image::manage-backup-restore/inlineDiffView.png[,720,align=left]

[#delete-backups]
=== Delete Backups

By means of the *Backup* facility's *Data* screen, individual backups can be deleted.
At the extreme right of the row for each listed backup, a garbage-can icon appears:

image::manage-backup-restore/inspectBackupsIndividualRow.png[,720,align=left]

Left-click on this icon to delete the backup described on the row.
The *Delete Backup* dialog appears, requesting confirmation:

image::manage-backup-restore/deleteBackupConfirmation.png[,420,align=left]

Enter the backup name into the interactive text field, and left-click on *Delete*, to continue with deletion.
The backup is deleted.
Note that once it has been deleted, it cannot be restored.

[#inspect-tasks]
== Inspect Tasks

To inspect currently defined tasks, do _either_ of the following:

* Left-click on the *Tasks* button that appears on the expanded row for a repository, on the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen.

* Left-click on the *Tasks* button that appears at the upper-right of the *Backup* screen, which has been accessed by means of the *Inspect Backups* button that appears on the expanded row for a repository, on the *Backup* screen.

The *Tasks* screen appears as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/tasksScreen.png[,720,align=left]

The screen provides two possible views, which are *Tasks* and *Backups*: these can be selected by means of the buttons at the upper right.
The *Tasks* button is currently selected.
(Left-clicking on the *Backups* button displays the *Repository* screen, described above in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#inspect-backups[Inspect Backups]).

The *Running* field provides information on any tasks currently running.
The *History* button permits a refresh of data shown in the lower panel; which lists the current history of tasks performed.
The *Get Tasks* button allows specific tasks to be identified by search, and displayed.
The earliest date for the task can be specified in the *Since Day* field; and the name of the task in the *Task Name* field, so as to narrow the search.
A limit on the number of tasks displayed can be specified as an integer, between 1 and 100 inclusive, in the *Limit* field.

The main task list, in the lower panel has an *Offset* figure displayed at its head: this indicates the position in the list of the first displayed task; and changes when the *prev batch* and *next batch* controls, at the right-hand side, are left-clicked on.
The task list is presented as a table, which shows, for each task that has been executed, the *Task name*, *Task type* (such as *Backup* or *Merge*), status (such as *done* or *running*), the *Elapsed* time for the task, the number of *Items* and size of data that was *Transferred* by the task, and the *Start* and *End* times for the task.

To inspect a particular task in detail, left-click on the row for the task.
For example:

image::manage-backup-restore/leftClickOnTaskRow.png[,240,align=left]

The selected row is expanded vertically, as follows:

image::manage-backup-restore/expandedTaskRow.png[,480,align=left]

The details of the task are thus displayed as a JSON document.
The details include counts of items, vBuckets, and bytes received from the operation.
The `node_runs` subdocument provides information specific to each node in the cluster.

[#schedule-merges]
== Schedule Merges

A _merge_ allows multiple backups to be combined as one; with _deduplication_ occurring.

Merges are supported for filesystem-based repositories: however, merges are _not_ supported for cloud-based repositories.
If a merge is scheduled for a cloud-based repository, the Backup Service skips the task.
An immediate merge cannot be triggered for a cloud-based repository.

Merges can be scheduled as _tasks_, to be applied to backed up data within a defined repository.
This section describes how task-definition and scheduling for merges can be accomplished.
Note that for any given repository, the Backup Service performs one task at a time; with each task maintaining a lock on the repository.
Therefore, the administrator-defined interval between tasks should always be sufficient to allow each task to run to completion.
If a new task is scheduled to start while a previously started task is still running, the new task cannot run.
For information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc#avoiding-task-overlap[Avoiding Task Overlap].

Proceed as follows, noting that the initial steps (for adding a repository, creating a new plan, and adding a backup task to the plan) are the same as those described in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#schedule-backups[Schedule Backups], above.

. Access the *Backup* screen, and left-click on *ADD REPOSITORY*.
When the *Select Plan* dialog is displayed, choose *+ Create new plan*.

. In the redisplayed *Select Plan* dialog, specify a *Name* and a *Description* for the plan.
Then, specify the *Services* whose data should be backed up.
+
Note that a merge can only be scheduled as part of a plan that also schedules backup: the merge will be applied to backups within the defined repository.

. Left-click on *Add Task*, and add a *Backup* task.
For example:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/backUpTaskForMerging.png[,420,align=left]
+
This task calls for a backup to occur every hour.
Next, left-click on the *Add Task* control.
When the fields for defining an additional task appear, specify the task to be of type *Merge*, with a frequency of four hours; and to start on the half-hour (to allow time for each backup task, itself run on the hour, to complete).
For example:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/mergeTask.png[,420,align=left]
+
The *Type* of the task *MergeTask* has thus been specified as *Merge*, with a frequency of four hours.
Note the fields *Merge Offset Start* and *Merge Offset End*, which respectively specify the relative start and end points of each merge that will be performed.
An offset start of *0* indicates that each merge will start with backups made on the current day, if such backups exist.
An offset end of *2* indicates that each merge will end with backups that were made 2 days before the specified start-day, if such backups exist.
If backups were not made every day during the specified period, as many as can be found will be merged.
+
Note that a detailed, diagrammatic explanation of *Merge Offset Start* and *Merge Offset End* is provided in xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc#specifying-merge-offsets[Specifying Merge Offsets].
+
Left-click on the *Next* button:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/nextButton.png[,140,align=left]

. When the *Create Repository* dialog appears, enter the *ID* of the repository you are creating, the name of the *Bucket* that is being backed up, the appropriate value of *Storage Locations* (here, *Filesystem*), and the on-disk location of the repository-archive.
(Note that this on-disk location must be accessible to _all_ Backup Service nodes in the cluster.)
For example:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/createRepositoryForMerge.png[,420,align=left]
+
Left-click on the *Add* button.
The new repository now appears in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/newRepositoryConfirmed.png[,720,align=left]

The defined backups and merges will now occur, on the specified schedule.
This can eventally be seen by left-clicking on the row for the new repository, and then left-clicking on *Inspect Backups*.

[#perform-an-immediate-merge]
== Perform an Immediate Merge

By accessing a vertically expanded repository-display in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, an _immediate merge_ can be manually triggered.
The repository does not need to have scheduled merges in its plan; but must already contain multiple backups, so that some or all of these can be merged.

Note that merges are supported for filesystem-based repositories only: they are _not_ supported for cloud-based repositories.

Proceed as follows:

. In the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, select a repository that contains multiple backups, by left-clicking on the row for the repository.
When the row has expanded vertically, left-click on the *Merge* button:
+
image::manage-backup-restore/mergeButton.png[,90,align=left]
+
The *Merge Backups* dialog is now displayed:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/mergeDialog.png[,420,align=left]
+
The dialog allows determination of which backups should be merged, based on specification of the _first_ and the _last_: these backups, and all backups that occurred between them, will be merged.

. To specify the first backup, access the interactive control at the right-hand side of the *Start* field.
This produces a pull-down menu that displays all available backups for this repository:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/start-menu-backups-for-merge.png[,420,align=left]

. Select a backup that will be the starting backup for the merge.
Then, access the control at the right-hand side of the *End* field, and select, from its pull-down menu, a backup that will be the ending backup for the merge.
The dialog now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/mergeDialogComplete.png[,420,align=left]

. Left-click on the *Merge Backups* button, at the lower right of the dialog.
The dialog now disappears, and the following notification appears, at the lower left of the console:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/mergeNotification.png[,220,align=left]
+
The specified merge has now been triggered.

. To check the results, in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, left-click on the *Inspect Backups* button, on the expanded row for the selected repository.
This displays the history of backups and merges for the repository.
(It may be necessary to scroll through multiple screens of information, to find the merge that has been created.)
+
image:manage-backup-restore/dataScreenShowingMergedBackup.png[,720,align=left]
+
Here, the merge of incremental builds just performed is clearly indicated; as `merge - full backup`.
To obtain further specifics, left-click on the row for the merge.
The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/backupMergeConfirmation.png[,720,align=left]
+
The details in the expanded row confirm that five backups were merged by the operation just performed.

[#restore-backups]
== Restore Backups

One or more backups can be _restored_ to the cluster; which means that the data in the backups is copied back into the buckets from which it was originally backed up, or into other buckets.
Proceed as follows:

. In the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, select the repository from which data is to be restored, and left-click on the row for the repository, in order to expand it vertically.
Then, left-click on the *Restore* button:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreButton.png[,140,align=left]
+
The *Restore* dialog is now displayed:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreDialog.png[,420,align=left]

. Use the *Restore* dialog to specify which backup or backups should be restored.
In the *Cluster* field, enter the IP address of the cluster at which the data-restoration is targeted.
Enter username and password for the target cluster in the *User* and *Password* fields, and then use the controls at the right-hand sides of the *Start* and *End* fields to select the first and last backups in the series that is to be restored.
The dialog now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreDialogPartiallyComplete.png[,420,align=left]

. Open the *Services* tab, on the *Restore* dialog, and specify the services whose data is to be restored &#8212; unchecking the checkbox for each service whose data is not required.
For example:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreUncheckCheckboxes.png[,240,align=left]

. Open the *Advanced Restore Options* tab, on the *Restore* dialog.
The dialog expands vertically, revealing the following fields:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreAdvancedOptionsInitial.png[,420,align=left]
+
These fields allow selection of documents to be restored on the basis of the data they contain.
Documents that meet the specified criteria are included in the data-restoration; those that do not are omitted from it.
+
Use of these fields is optional: if all data in the specified backups is to be restored, leave these fields blank.
If only some data should be restored, proceed as follows:
+
In the *Filter Keys* field, add a _regular expression_ that must be matched by a document's _key_, if the document is to be included in the restoration.
For example, `^airline` ensures that only a document whose key begins with the string `airline` is included.
+
In the *Filter Values* field, add a regular expression that must be matched by a _value_ within the document, if the document is to be included in the restoration.
For example, `MIL*` ensures that only a document that contains at least one key-value pair whose value contains the string `MIL` followed by zero of more characters is to be included in the restoration.
(See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions[Regular Expressions^] and https://www.regular-expressions.info/[Regular-Expressions.info^], for further information.)
+
In the *Map Data* field, indicate whether the data is to be restored to its original or to a different bucket.
If this field is left blank, data is restored to its original bucket: note that this bucket must continue to exist on the cluster.
If data is to be restored to a different bucket, that bucket must either already have been defined on the cluster, or must be created by means of the *Auto-create bucket* option, described below.
+
For example, if data to be restored from `travel-sample` should be restored to `ts`, enter `travel-sample=ts`.
+
Use the *Include Data* and *Exclude Data* fields to indicate the subset of buckets whose data is to be restored.
For example, if backups to be restored were made when the cluster had four buckets defined, named `bucket1`, `bucket2`, `bucket3`, and `bucket4`, entering `bucket1,bucket4` in the *Include Data* field ensures that only data from `bucket1` and `bucket4` is restored; while entering `bucket2,bucket3` in the *Exclude Data* field ensures that data from `bucket2` and `bucket3` is _not_ restored. Note that these options are intended for use on backups that included all buckets on the cluster: they are not required when the backup was made of one bucket only.
+
Note that the *Include Data* and *Exclude Data* fields also allow the _scopes_ and _collections_ within buckets to be specified.
To specify a scope within a bucket, use the syntax _bucket-name_._scope-name_.
To specify a collection within a scope within a bucket, use the syntax _bucket-name_._scope-name_._collection-name_.
For example, entering `bucket1.scope1` in the *Include Data* field would ensure that only data from the scope `scope1` within `bucket1` is restored; while entering `bucket2.scope1.collection1` in the *Exclude Data* field would ensure that data from `collection1`, within `scope1` in `bucket2`, is _not_ be restored.
(For an overview of scopes and collections, see xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections].)
+
Check the *Force Updates* field to ensure that data restored from the specified backup  overwrites the current values on the cluster when the current values are the more recent.
If the *Force Updates* checkbox is not checked, current values are not overwritten if more recent.
+
Check the *Auto-remove Collections* checkbox to omit from the restoration any scope or collection that has been removed from the cluster since the backup was performed.
(Note that if a data-containing, administrator-created collection is backed up, but is then deleted from the cluster with all its data, the deleted data will not be restored by the *Restore* operation: however, the empty collection _will_ be restored by the *Restore* operation, unless the *Auto-remove Collections* checkbox is checked, prior to the *Restore* operation.)
+
Check the *Auto-create Buckets* checkbox to create any buckets to which the restoration has been mapped that do not yet exist on the target cluster.
+
For example, the *Restore* dialog may now appear as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/restoreDialogComplete.png[,420,align=left]
+
Values are thus specified for filtering documents on a basis of both key and value.
The data to be restored from `travel-sample` is specified to be restored to a bucket named `ts`, which has not previously been created: therefore, the *Auto-create Buckets* checkbox has been checked.

. Left-click on *Restore*.
This triggers the specified restoration.
The dialog disappears; and a green restore-notification appears, at the lower left of the console.

Subsequent to the operation, its results can be checked; by means of the *Buckets* screen of Couchbase Web Console, which might now appear as follows:

image:manage-backup-restore/newBucketWithRestoredData.png[,720,align=left]

A new bucket, named `ts`, has thus been created.
Its item-count indicates that it contains only a subset of the documents contained in `travel-sample`, in accordance with the filtering specified for the restore operation.

[#pause-backups]
== Pause Backups

The Backup Service allows scheduled backups to be _paused_, indefinitely.
This may be useful when a cluster is undergoing maintenance, or when buckets are otherwise not available.
Once a pause is executed by the administrator, no scheduled task for the repository is executed.
Then, when a _resume_ is subsequently executed by the administrator, the task-schedule is resumed at the earliest, planned opportunity: thus, if backups are hourly, and a pause is executed at 9:50 am, if a resume occurs at 9:58 am, the next backup occurs at 10:00 am; but if the resume occurs at 10:02 am, then the next backup occurs at 11:00 am.

To pause a backup, access the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, and left-click on the row for the repository to be paused.
This expands the row vertically, and displays the *Pause* button.
Left-click on this, to pause backups:

image:manage-backup-restore/pauseButton.png[,240,align=left]

The button now changes into a *Resume* button.
Left-click on this whenever backups are to be resumed:

image:manage-backup-restore/resumeButton.png[,240,align=left]

[#archive-repositories]
== Archive Repositories

When a repository should no longer receive fresh backups, the repository can be _archived_.
This means that it remains available, with all its data; but no longer receives modifications.
To archive a repository, proceed as follows;

. Access the repository that is to be archived in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, and expand the row for the repository by left-clicking on the repository's row.
When the row has expanded, left-click on the *Archive* button:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/archiveButton.png[,90,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Archive Repository* dialog, which appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/archiveRepositoryDialog.png[,420,align=left]
+
The dialog contains a notification, warning that no further backups or merges will be possible to the repository, once it has been archived.

. Confirm the repository to be archived.
Enter its name into the *Confirm repository ID to archive* field.
Then, enter the intended name of the _archived_ version of the repository into the *New ID* field.
The dialog now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/archiveRepositoryDialogComplete.png[,420,align=left]
+
Left-click on *Archive*, to confirm.
The dialog now disappears.

. Check the archived repository, in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, in the *Archived* panel.
This now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/archivedRepository.png[,720,align=left]
+
Left-click on the row for the archived repository, to expand the row, and reveal details and options:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/archivedRepositoryExpandedRow.png[,720,align=left]
+
The backups within and tasks used for the repository can be examined by means of the *Inspect Backups* and *Tasks* buttons.
The *Restore* button brings up the same dialog as described above, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#restore-backups[Restore Backups].
The *Delete* button is described immediately below, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#delete-repositories[Delete Repositories].

[#delete-repositories]
== Delete Repositories

Repositories can be deleted.
However, no repository can be deleted until it has been archived, as described above, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#archive-repositories[Archive Repositories].

Therefore, to delete a repository, and the backups it contains, proceed as follows:

. Archive the repository, as described in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#archive-repositories[Archive Repositories].

. Access the archived repository, in the *Archived Repositories* panel that appears in the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, and open the row for the repository, by left-clicking on it.

. Left-click on the *Delete* button.
The *Delete Repositories* dialog now appears:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/deleteRepositories.png[,420,align=left]
+
The dialog provides two options for deletion.
If the *Delete backup data files* checkbox is checked, the deletion is irreversible: the archived information no longer exists on disk.
If the checkbox is unchecked (which is the default), the deleted archive's contents continue to exist on disk, even though no longer explicitly tracked by the Backup Service, and so can be recovered subsequently; as described below, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#import-repositories[Import Repositories].
+
To delete the archive while allowing the contents to continue to exist on disk, enter the name of the archive in the *Confirm Repository ID* field, leave the *Delete backup data files* checkbox unchecked, and left-click on *Delete*.
Subsequently, the archived repository is no longer maintained by the Backup Service, and no longer appears in the *Archived Repositories* panel.

[#import-repositories]
== Import Repositories

A repository not currently managed by the Backup Service can be _imported_ into the service, by means of the *Backup* UI.
For example, a repository that was archived and subsequently deleted can be imported back into the service, provided that its on-disk files were not explicitly deleted (see xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#delete-repositories[Delete Repositories], above, for information on deleting repositories while preserving on-disk files).

To import a repository, proceed as follows:

. Left-click on the *IMPORT* tab, at the upper right of the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/importTab.png[,180,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Import Repository* dialog, which appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/importRepository.png[,420,align=left]

. Enter appropriate details into the *Import Repository* dialog.
+
In the *ID* field, enter a name for the repository, which will be used once the repository has been imported.
The name must be unique across the cluster, can only use the characters `[`, `]`, `A` to `Z`, `a` to `z`, `&#95;` and `-`; and must not start with either `&#95;` or `-`.
+
The *Storage Location* can be specified as *Filesystem* (the default) or *Cloud*.
For the current example, *Filesystem* will be used.
Note that if *Cloud* is selected, allowing AWS S3 storage to be used, the dialog expands, and displays additional options: these are described below, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#use-cloud-storage[Use Cloud Storage].
+
In the *Cbbackupmgr Repository Path*, enter the path of the repository to be imported.
If necessary, locate on disk the folder within which the repository resides:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/repoOnDisk1.png[,110,align=left]
+
Locate the repository within its parent folder, and make a copy of the repository name:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/repoOnDisk2.png[,200,align=left]
+
Then, specify the repository name as part of the full file path.
The *Import Repository* dialog now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/importRepositoryComplete.png[,420,align=left]

. Left-click on the *Import* button, at the lower right of the dialog.
The dialog disappears, and the repository is imported.

. Check the results of the import operation.
Access the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen, and observe the *Imported Repositories* panel:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/importedRepositoriesPanel.png[,720,align=left]
+
For further details, left-click on the row to make it expand vertically:
+
image:manage-backup-restore/importedRepositoriesPanelExpanded.png[,720,align=left]

[#inspect-plans]
== Inspect Plans

All plans created for the Backup Service can be reviewed, by left-clicking on the *Plans* tab, on the upper, horizontal navigation bar of the *Backup* screen:

image:manage-backup-restore/plansTab.png[,260,align=left]

This displays the *Backup* screen's *Plans* view:

image:manage-backup-restore/plansScreen.png[,720,align=left]

The plan displays, in the *name* column, the name of every current plan; under the *instances* column, an integer that represents the number of repositories maintained by means of the plan identified on the current row; and under *services*, the Couchbase Services whose data is handled by the plan.

To inspect a plan in detail, left-click on its row, to make the row expand vertically.
For example:

image:manage-backup-restore/HourlyBackupPlanExpanded.png[,720,align=left]

The displayed details indicate that *HourlyBackupPlan* contains two tasks: the *HourlyBackupTask* performs a task of type *BACKUP* every hour; while the *FourthHourMergeTask* performs a task of type *MERGE* every 4 hours, merging all backups from the current day to two days ago..

At the right-hand side of each row, a garbage-can icon is displayed.
To delete a plan, left-click on the icon on the row of the plan to be deleted: the plan is deleted immediately, and no longer appears on the *Plans* screen.
(Note that a plan cannot be deleted until all repositories using it are archived or themselves deleted.)

[#default-plans]
=== Default Plans

The Backup Service provides two plans by default, which are *_daily_backups* and *_hourly_backups*:

* The *&#95;daily_backups* plan backs up data for _all_ services, every day.
A _full_ backup is performed on Monday, and an incremental on each other day.
The previous weeks' backups are merged every Sunday, and the previous 28 days' backups are merged every 28 days.

* The *&#95;hourly_backups* plan backs up data for _all_ services, ever hour.
Every backup is incremental.
Each day at midnight, all the previous days' backups are merged.
The previous week's backups are merged every Sunday, and the previous 28 days' backups are merged every 28 days.

[#review-scheduling-options]
== Review Scheduling-Options

Backup-Service scheduling options are provided _per task_, on the *Select Plan* dialog; which is provided as part of the sequence for repository-definition, after the administrator has left-clicked on the *ADD REPOSITORY* tab, at the upper right of the *Repositories* view of the *Backup* screen.
See xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#schedule-backups[Schedule Backups], for details.

The task-definition panel provided for each task appears by default as follows:

image:manage-backup-restore/taskScheduleInitial.png[,420,align=left]

The default, *Weekly Calendar* option refers to use of the two, interactive, days-of-the-week selectors that appear under *Full Backups* and *Normal Backups* (a _normal_ backup being an _incremental_ backup).
The day-by-day frequency of each kind of backup can thus be determined by left-clicking on the appropriate days.
For example, the following selection would indicate that a full backup should occur on Saturday, every week; and an incremental build should occur every week on each of the following days: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

image:manage-backup-restore/simplifiedSchedule.png[,420,align=left]

A *Weekly Calendar* schedule means that one backup happens daily.
The time of the daily backup can be specified by means of the *Time* panel.
No merge can be scheduled, nor can backups be scheduled more frequently.

Alternatively scheduled merges and backups can be configured by accessing the control at the left-hand side of the *Period* field:

image:manage-backup-restore/scheduleOptionsMenu.png[,420,align=left]

The pull-down menu thus displayed contains three kinds of scheduling option.
One is the default, *Weekly Calendar*.
Another is by means of _time-units_: which are *Minutes*, *Hours*, *Days*, and *Weeks*.
If a unit is specified, an appropriate integer must be entered into the *Frequency* field, to indicate the number of time-units that must elapse between repetitions of the task.
If *Minutes* are specified, only the minutes portion of the time entered into the *Time* field is used &#8212; as the starting point, every hour, for the task sequence; with the task being repeated throughout the hour as many times as specified in the *Frequency* field.
If *Hours* are specified, the task is first performed at the time specified in the *Time* field, and then repeated as specified in the *Frequency* field.
If *Days* or *Weeks* are specified, the task is performed as scheduled, at the time specified in the *Time* field.
(A full example of using *Minutes* as time-units is provided above, in xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#schedule-backups[Schedule Backups].)

A third option is by means of _days_: such as *Monday*, *Tuesday*, and so on.
If a day is selected, an appropriate integer must be entered into the *Frequency* field, to indicate the number of instances of the day's occurrence that should elapse before the task is performed.
For instance, if *Monday* and *3* are specified, the task is performed on the first Monday, then two Mondays elapse, and then the task is performed again on the fourth Monday; and so on.
The time at which the task is commenced is that specified in the *Time* field.

[#use-cloud-storage]
== Use Cloud Storage

Cloud storage can be used for backups.
However, cloud storage _cannot_ be used for merges.
If a merge is scheduled for cloud storage, the Backup Service skips the task.
An immediate merge cannot be triggered for cloud storage.

During the input-sequence for repository-creation, storage for the repository can be specified.
See xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#schedule-backups[Schedule Backups], for an example of using the local filesystem.
Alternatively, cloud storage can be selected, from the *Storage Locations* field of the *Select Plan* dialog.
When the selection is made, the dialog expands vertically, as follows:

image:manage-backup-restore/cloudStorageOptions.png[,420,align=left]

The fields are as follows:

* *Staging Directory*.
A directory on the local file system that is large enough to accommodate approximately 10% of the data set that is to be backed up.
A minimum of 50 GB is recommended.
The pathname of the location must be accessible to all nodes in the cluster that are running the Backup Service; but the location itself must be _not_ be shared by NFS or any equivalent protocol.
Instead, the location must be a non-shared directory on the local file system for the node.

* *Provider*.
To use either S3 or S3-compatible storage, select *AWS*.

* *Cloud Bucket*.
The bucket in the cloud to which data will be backed up.

* *Path Prefix*.
The path of the archive, within the cloud bucket.
This should take the form `/path/inside/the/bucket`.

* *Cloud Auth Type*
The type of authentication to be used when communicating with the cloud provider.
The options are *ID and key* (which means that an ID and key will indeed be required for communication to be successful) and *Instance metadata service* (which means that credentials will be sought from the metadata service running in the node's virtual machine).
Each option assumes that appropriate configuration procedures for the cloud environment have been followed.

* *Credential ID*.
The credential ID for the store.
For AWS, this is the _access key id_.
If *Instance metadata service* has been specified as the value for *Cloud Auth Type*, this field is inapplicable, and is no longer displayed.

* *Credential Key*.
The secret key for the store.
For AWS, this is the _AWS secret access key_.
If *Instance metadata service* has been specified as the value for *Cloud Auth Type*, this field is inapplicable, and is no longer displayed.

* *Region*.
The AWS Region for the repository.
For example, `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`.

Under *Advanced cloud options*, the *Endpoint* field accepts an optional endpoint, used to connect to AWS; and overriding the endpoint used by the cloud-provider.

If checked, the *S3 Force path style* checkbox ensures that the AWS path style used is the earlier (rather than the more recent, which is not supported by all S3 compatible object stores).

[#using-the-rest-api]
== Using the REST API

The Backup Service can be configured and used by means of the REST API.
For reference pages on each supported endpoint, see xref:rest-api:backup-rest-api.adoc[Backup Service API].
