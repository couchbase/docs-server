[abstract]
Couchbase Server allows one or more buckets, and selected subsets of their data, to be backed up, restored, and archived.

== Understanding Backup and Restore

The data on a Couchbase-Server cluster can be backed up, restored, and archived by means of either of the following:

* The UI provided on the *Backup* facility of Couchbase Web Console.

* The `cbbackupmgr` CLI utility.

The technology that underlies the *Backup* facility of Couchbase Web Console is in fact provided by `cbbackupmgr`: note, however, that `cbbackupmgr` provides some features that are not available from the UI.
For use of either interface, the Full Admin role must have been assigned.
On Couchbase Server 7.0 and above, both interfaces are available in both the Enterprise and the Community Edition.
Both support use of AWS S3 storage.

Note that two additional tools, `cbbackup` and `cbrestore`, continue to be available in Couchbase Server 7.0: however, both are deprecated.

[#differences-between-the-ui-and-cbbackupmgr]
=== Backup and Restore: UI versus CLI

The UI provided by the *Backup* facility of Couchbase Web Console allows backup, restore, and archiving to be configured for the local cluster; and also permits restore to be configured for a remote cluster.
By contrast, `cbbackupmgr` allows backup, restore, and archiving each to be configured either for the local or for a remote cluster: all available options are listed in xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc##version-compatibility[Version Compatibility].

Both the UI and `cbbackupmgr` allow either full or incremental backups to be scheduled.
Both allow incremental backups, once created, to be merged, and their data deduplicated.
Both use the same backup archive structure; and allow the contents of backups to be listed, and specific documents to be searched for.

For detailed information on how `cbbackupmgr` works, see the xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc#discussion[Discussion] provided on the page for xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr].
The page for xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr] also provides a synopsis of the command, and a description of its basic options; and is co-located with additional pages that provide information on specific subcommands for collecting logs, compacting, merging, and more.

The remainder of the current page describes how to perform backup, restore, and archiving by means of the UI.
