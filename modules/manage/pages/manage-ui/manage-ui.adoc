= Couchbase Web Console

[abstract]
The features of Couchbase Server can be managed by means of Couchbase Web Console.

[#understanding-couchbase-web-console]
== Understanding Couchbase Web Console

_Couchbase Web Console_ is a browser-based, interactive graphical facility that supports the management of Couchbase Server.
This includes:

* Monitoring performance and server-state, by means of constantly updated statistics, displayed in customizable, interactive charts.

* Configuring services, including indexes.

* Adding and removing cluster-nodes.

* Setting up Cross Data Center Replication.

* Interactively composing documents, and executing queries.

* Managing security, including the addition of users, the assignment of roles, and the configuration of external authentication mechanisms.

The range of features made available depends on the _roles_ that have been assigned to the user who logs into the console.
If the user has been assigned the _Full Administrator_ role, they have complete access to all features; and can therefore read, write, execute, and manage without constraint.
Other roles limit the feature-range.
For detailed information, see xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

This page provides an overview of the complete feature-set made available by Couchbase Web Console.
In many cases, detailed explanations of the user interface is provided elsewhere in the documentation-set, in correspondence with the supported feature.
Links are provided in each case.

[#accessing-the-console]
== Accessing the Console

Couchbase Web Console is typically accessible at port _8091_, of the host system, although the port number may be different if _secure_ console-access has been established: see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access], for information.
When the appropriate port is accessed, the following interface is displayed:

[#console-setup-screen]
image::manage-ui/setupScreen.png[,420,align=left]

The interface provides two options:

* *Setup New Cluster*: which establishes the current server as an independent cluster of one node, to which other node can subsequently be added.

* *Join Existing Cluster*: which establishes current server as a node that is part of a pre-existing cluster.

These procedures, which include establishing credentials for administrator-authentication, are described in detail in xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster].
The remaining information on this page assumes that a cluster of at least one node has been established.
The features of the console will be portrayed as visible to the _Full Administrator_, with no constraints on what can be viewed.

[#authenticating-with-the-console]
== Authenticating with the Console

Once the cluster is running, all its administrators must _authenticate_, in order to access its features.
Therefore, when port _8091_ is accessed by means of the browser, the following interface is displayed:

[#console-login-screen]
image::manage-ui/loginScreen.png[,360,align=left]

Enter username and password, and left-click on the *Sign In* button to access the console.

Detailed information on authenticating with Couchbase Server is provided in xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication].

[#understanding-the-dashboard]
== Understanding the Dashboard

On the user's successful login, the console displays the *Dashboard*.
If this is the user's first-time access, the appearance is as follows:

[#dashboard-appearance]
image::manage-ui/dashboardInitial.png[,700,align=left]

The display thus consists of a *banner* with interactive controls; a *main panel*, which allows display of data and configuration fields; a *left-hand navigation bar*, which allows the main panel's content to be determined; and a *lower panel*, which displays current status on the cluster.
These are described below.

[#console-banner]
=== Banner

At the left, the banner features the name of the console, as determined during server-setup.
It also displays the name of the currently displayed screen, *Dashboard*.
At the right, it provides information identifying the version of the server that is being run, and the build number.

In the white horizontal band immediately above the banner, at the right-hand side, three interactive options appear:

* *activity*. When Couchbase Server is engaged in an activity of any considerable duration (such as loading data, or distributing data across multiple nodes), an appropriate notification is provided here.
Left-click on the tab to display the notification.

* *help*. Tabs that respectively allow all customers to access documentation for the server-release; and allow certain customers to contact Couchbase Customer Support.

* *Administrator*. Tabs that respectively allow the administrator to redefine their password, and to sign out of the console.

[#console-main-panel]
=== Main Panel

The content of the main panel changes, based on selections made by the user in the left-hand navigation bar.
The default display is that of the *Dashboard*.
When first accessed, this is comparatively empty: however, the user is able to add charts incrementally, in order to display constantly updated sets of statistics that are judged to be of primary importance.
In consequence, the appearance of the *Dashboard* will be customized differently by every user.
Note that initially, a notification appears, explaining that no _data buckets_ currently exist; and providing options for the addition of buckets.
Such addition is required prior to *Dashboard*-customization; since all statistics will be presented in relation to existing buckets.

Detailed information on incrementally adding charts is provided in xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].

[#console-left-hand-nav]
=== Navigation Bar

The vertical _navigation bar_, which appears at the left-hand side, provides a tab for each of the major features that can be accessed and managed.
On initial access, the *Dashboard* tab, at the top, is selected by default.
Information is provided below on each of the possible selections.

Note that when the mouse cursor is hovered over elements in the navigation bar, a toggle appears at the lower left.
Left-clicking on this causes the navigation bar to be collapsed, thereby freeing up more horizontal space for the main panel.

[#console-nav-bar-toggle]
image::manage-ui/navBarToggle.png[,120,align=left]

The toggle remains accessible, and can be used to restore the navigation bar at any time.

[#console-lower-panel]
=== Lower Panel

The _lower panel_ provides information on cluster status.

* _Nodes_ are represented by icons in green, orange, or red; which corresponds to whether they are _active_, _failed-over_, _pending-rebalance_, or _inactive_.
Detailed information on nodes, their status, and how they can be managed is provided in xref:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[Manage Nodes and Clusters].

* Installed _Services_ and _Cross Data Center Replication_ are represented by icons in green or grey,
If a service-icon is green, this indicates that it is installed and running.
If it is grey, it is not installed.
Cross Data Center Replication (_XDCR_) does not require installation; and is either green or grey depending on whether a replication is in process.

Information on services is provided in xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services].
Information on XDCR is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)].

[#accesing-features]
== Accessing Features

Couchbase Web Console allows users to access features by left-clicking on _tabs_.
Tabs are located:

* _In the left-hand navigation bar_.
Whenever a tab is left-clicked on, the appearance of the console's _main panel_ changes, to display content for the selected feature.

* _In the upper, horizontal navigation bar_.
This appears, for _some_ features, immediately above the main panel.
Whenever a tab is left-clicked on, the appearance of the main panel changes, to display alternative content for the feature selected from the left-hand navigation bar.

The remaining sections on this page describe in turn the features accessed by left-clicking on the tabs provided.

[#console-nav-servers]
== Servers

Left-click on the *Servers* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#console-servers-tab]
image::manage-ui/serversTab.png[,100,align=left]

The main panel changes, to display the *Servers* screen.
Its initial appearance is as follows:

[#console-servers-screen]
image::manage-ui/serversScreenInitial.png[,700,align=left]

The *Servers* screen provides information on every node in the cluster.
In this case, the cluster consists of a single node: therefore, a single row of information is displayed, for the current node.
This information includes the following:

* *name*.
The name of the node, established during setup.

* *group*.
The group that the node is currently a member of.
For conceptual information on groups, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server Group Awareness].
For practical information on group management, see xref:manage:manage-groups/manage-groups.adoc[Manage Groups].

* *services*.
The services installed on the node.
In this case, all six services have been installed and are running: *analytics*, *data*, *eventing*, *index*, *query*, and *search*.
Note that five out of the six services have an identically named tab corresponding to them, in the left-hand navigation bar; whereby service-specific configuration and management can be performed.
The *data* service is accessed by means of the *Buckets*, *Documents*, and *Views* tabs, in the left-hand navigation bar.
Information on all of these tabs is provided below.
+
For conceptual information on services, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services].

* *CPU*, *RAM*, *swap*, *disk used*.
Information on resource-consumption, on the specified node.

* *items*.
The active and replica data items currently residing on the node.
For information on intra-cluster replication, see learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster Replication].

* *Statistics*
Left-click on this interactive tab, to display statistics.
Note that statistics are only available when at least one bucket has been installed.

Above the server-information row, two additional controls are provided:

* *filter servers...*
To filter the display of servers (when there are many), enter a string.
Those server whose names provide a match are those displayed.

* *Rebalance*.
Left-clicking on this control causes a _rebalance_ to be performed, across the cluster.
For conceptual information on rebalance, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc[Rebalance].
For practical information on performing rebalance, see xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance].

To the right-hand side of the banner, three further controls appear:

* *Groups*.
Allows management of server groups, as described in xref:manage:manage-groups/manage-groups.adoc[Manage Groups].

* *Failover*.
Allows one or more nodes to be failed over, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/fail-nodes-over.adoc[Fail a Node Over and Rebalance].

* *Add Server*.
Allows a server to be added to the current cluster, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance].

For an example of the *Servers* screen with a cluster of multiple nodes, see the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/recover-data-with-xdcr.adoc#three_node_local_cluster[three node cluster] used in
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/recover-data-with-xdcr.adoc[Recover Data with XDCR].

[#console-buckets]
== Buckets

To access the *Buckets* screen, left-click on the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#console-buckets-tab]
image::manage-ui/bucketsTab.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *Buckets* screen, which initially appears as follows:

[#console-buckets-screen]
image::manage-ui/bucketsScreenInitial.png[,700,align=left]

The screen is initially almost blank, since no buckets have yet been added to the server.
A notification is provided, with options to use the *Add Bucket* control at the upper right, or to use the *Add Sample Buckets* facility, in order to add a bucket containing data that is ready to support testing and experimentation.

The procedure for adding a _sample bucket_ is provided in xref:manage:manage-settings/manage-settings.adoc[Manage Settings].
After this procedure is followed for the `travel-sample` bucket, the *Buckets* screen appears as follows:

[#console-buckets-screen-after-bucket-addition]
image::manage-ui/bucketsScreenWithBucket.png[,700,align=left]

The *Buckets* screen displays each bucket on its own row, with supporting information distributed horizontally, in columns.
The column headings are:

* *name*.
The name of the bucket.

* *items*.
The number of data items (typically referred to as _documents_) within the bucket.

* *resident*.
The percentage of the items resident on the current node.

* *ops/sec*.
The number of operations per second being performed on the bucket's data.

* *RAM used/quota*.
The amount of memory currently being used by the bucket, against its total allocated quota for this node.

* *disk used*.
The amount of disk used by the bucket, on this node.

To the right-hand side of the column, two tabs are provided, whereby additional information can be accessed.

The *Documents* tab allows the documents within the bucket to be individually read and edited.
This facility can also be accessed by means of the *Documents* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar; as explained in xref:manage:manage-ui/manage-ui.adoc#console-documents[Documents], below.

The *Statistics* tab allows statistical information for the bucket to be displayed.
By left-clicking on this tab, the *Statistics* screen is accessed:

[#console-buckets-statistics]
image::manage-ui/statisticsScreen.png[,700,align=left]

The principal chart shows operations per second, performed on the data within the bucket.
Controls to the right permit selection of time-granularity for the display.
Further below, a series of options is provided for close examination of statistics.
Each option, when opened, displays a variety of small charts, each dedicated to a particular statistic.
The first option in the vertical series, *Summary*, is open by default.

Note that by hovering the mouse cursor over a chart's legend, a pop-up explanation of the statistic is revealed:

[#console-buckets-statistics-popup]
image::manage-ui/statisticsPopUp.png[,460,align=left]

The options and the charts they provide are as follows:

* *Summary*.
Operations, reads, writes, deletes, memory and disk usage, replication activity, index scans, and queries.

* *Server Resources*.
Memory, CPU, connections, ports, and analytics resources.

* *vBucket Resources*.
Numbers of vBuckets and items per node.
For information, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.adoc[vBuckets].

* *Disk Queues*.
Activity on the queues whereby data is saved to disk.

* *DCP Queues*.
Activity on the queues whereby data is replicated across cluster-nodes.

* *Index Stats*.
A set of charts for each index defined for the bucket.
Includes data size, items scanned, requests, memory usage, and fragementation.

* *Analytics Stats*.
Operations performed by the Analytics Service.

* *Incoming XDCR Operations*.
Operations resulting from the cluster's role as a target cluster for another cluster's Cross Data Center Replication.

At the bottom of the *Statistics* screen, a panel named *Top Keys* lists the keys of the most frequently accessed documents for the bucket.

[#buckets-learning-and-managing]
=== Buckets: Learning and Managing

A conceptual account of buckets is provided in xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Buckets].
Information on how manage buckets is provided in xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

[#console-xdcr]
== XDCR

To access the *XDCR* screen, left-click on the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#console-xdcr-tab]
image::manage-ui/xdcrTab.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *XDCR* screen, which initially appears as follows:

[#console-xdcr-screen]
image::manage-ui/xdcrScreenInitial.png[,700,align=left]

XDCR (or _Cross Data Center Replication_) replicates data between clusters, providing protection against data center failure.
Replication occurs from a specific bucket on the source cluster to a specific bucket on a target cluster.

The *XDCR* screen provides an upper panel named *Remote Clusters*.
This lists the clusters that have been defined as targets for repliction.
It also provides a lower panel, named *Ongoing Replications*, which will list those replications that are currently in progress.
For an example of the *Ongoing Replications* panel populated with information corresponding to an ongoing replication, see the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#ongoing-replications-with-replication[illustration] in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc[Create a Replication].

[#xdcr-learning-and-managing]
=== XDCR: Learning and Managing

An extensive conceptual overview of XDCR is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)].
Instructions on setting up and performing XDCR are provided in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR Management Overview].

[#console-security]
== Security

To access the *Security* screen, left-click on the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

The Couchbase Logging facility records important events, and saves the details to log files, on disk.
Additionally, subsets of information are provided on the *Logs* screen.

The *Logs* screen offers two views, one of which is the default representation of logged information.
The other is a facility for configuring _explicit logging_, which allows comprehensive and fully updated information to be generated as required.

Full details are provided in xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[Manage Logging].

[#console-documents]
== Documents

To access the *Documents* screen, left-click on the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:
