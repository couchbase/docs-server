[#tls-and-cipher-suites]
== TLS and Cipher-Suites

_Transport Layer Security_ (TLS) is a protocol that provides security over a computer network.
Couchbase Server supports the configuration of TLS, to secure communications between cluster-nodes, clusters, and external clients: this includes selection of an appropriate TLS version.

TLS supports multiple methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message-integrity.
Appropriate methods, supported by both participants in an intended networked communication, can be specified through selection of an appropriate _cipher-suite_, from defined lists of ones acceptable.
By default, Couchbase Server uses a list of `HIGH` security cipher-suites.
However, Couchbase Server also allows a _customized_ list to be defined and used instead.

When a TLS connection is established between a client application and Couchbase Server &#8212; for example, using the secure port `18091` &#8212; a _handshake_ occurs, as defined by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake[TLS Handshake Protocol].
As part of this exchange, the client sends to the server the client's own cipher-suite list; which specifies the cipher-suites that the client itself supports.
A server-setting is provided to specify whether the server then conforms to its own or the client's preference, in selecting a commonly acceptable cipher-suite to be used for the communication.

Once the selection has been made by Couchbase Server, Couchbase Server notifies the client of the selection, and the handshake process continues.

The TLS version and the cipher-suites to be used for the cluster can be managed with either the CLI or the REST API, as described below.

[#set-the-minimum-tls-version]
== Set the Minimum TLS Version

Couchbase Server supports TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2: the highest-supported version of TLS is recommended.
The version can be set with either the CLI or the REST API.

[#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-cli]
=== Set the Minimum TLS Version with the CLI

To set the minimum TLS version with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] command as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c 10.143.192.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--tls-min-version tlsv1.1
----

The `set` flag indicates that a value is to be set.
The `tls-min-version` flag specifies the appropriate minimum TLS value, which can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, or `tlsv1.2`; and is in this case specified as `tlsv1.1`.

If successful, the command returns the following success-message:

----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

For more information, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security]

[#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-rest-api]
=== Set the Minimum TLS Version with the REST API

To set the minimum TLS version with the REST API use the `POST /settings/security` http method and URI, as follows:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/security \
-d 'tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.2'
----

The `tlsMinVersion` flag specifies the minimum TLS version to be used; which can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, or `tlsv1.2`; and is in this case specified as `tlsv1.2`
If successful, the command gives a `200 OK` message, and returns an empty array.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Manage Encryption Settings].

[#manage-cipher-suite-lists]
== Manage Cipher-Suite Lists

As described above, in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#tls-and-cipher-suites[TLS and Cipher-Suites], a _custom_ cipher-suite list can be defined for Couchbase Server.
Additionally, Couchbase Server can be configured to conform to either its own or the client's preference, in selecting a commonly supported cipher-suite to be used for the communication.
These tasks can be accomplished with either the CLI or the REST API, as described below.

Note that the CLI and the REST API only accept _IETF RFC_ names, for cipher-suites.
They do not support _OpenSSL_ names.

[#manage-ciphers-with-the-cli]
=== Manage Cipher-Suites with the CLI

To manage cipher-suites with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] command as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c 10.143.192.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--tls-honor-cipher-order 1 \
--cipher-suites TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
----

The `set` parameter establishes use of the command to make settings.
The `tls-honor-cipher-order` parameter-value is specified as `1`, meaning that the server's preference-order for cipher-suites will be used, rather than the client's.
(Note, however, that this setting is also the default; and so will remain established even if this parameter is not specified.)
The `cipher-suites` parameter takes a value that is a list of cipher-suites to be used for the cluster.
If the value for `cipherSuites` is an empty list (`""`), this specifies that the Couchbase Server default cipher-suite list is to be used.

If the call is successful, the following message is displayed:

----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

For more information, see the reference page for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security].
Note that this includes information on using the `get` parameter, in order to _retrieve_ current settings.

[#manage-ciphers-with-the-rest-api]
=== Manage Cipher-Suites with the REST API

To manage cipher-suites with the REST API, use the `GET` and `POST` methods with the `/settings/security` URI.

To establish a cipher-suite list, and specify whether to honor the server's or the client's cipher-suite preference, enter the following:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/security \
-d honorCipherOrder=true \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"]'
----

The `honorCipherOrder` flag is specified as `true`, meaning that the server's order of preference for cipher-suites, rather than the client's, will be used.
(Note, however, that `true` is the default; meaning that the server's preference is used even if this parameter is not specified.)
The value specified for the `cipherSuites` flag is a list of cipher-suites that can be used for the server, in order of preference.
If the value for `cipherSuites` is an empty list (`[]`), this specifies that the Couchbase Server default cipher-suite list is to be used.

If successful, the call gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Manage Encryption Settings].
Note that this page contains information on the `GET` method, and provides an example of its use.

[#alternative-cipher-suite-list-configuration]
=== Alternative Cipher-Suite List-Configuration

The recommended way of establishing a custom cipher-suite list is given above, for the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#manage-ciphers-with-the-cli[CLI] and the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#manage-ciphers-with-the-rest-api[REST API].
However, a custom list can also be achieved by setting the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment variable: this _legacy_ means of establishing a custom cipher-suite is only supported on _Linux_ operating systems, and requires that the variable be defined _before_ Couchbase Server is started.

The environment variable can be set in either of the following ways:

* Specify an explicit list of ciphers to be used.
For example:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA,CAMELLIA128-SHA"
----

* Specify ciphers by security-level.
For example, to specify that all ciphers in both _medium_ and _high_ categories
be used, enter the following:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="MEDIUM,HIGH"
----

To display the ciphers available on your Linux platform for a particular security level, use the `openssl` command.
For example, to display the _high_-level ciphers, enter the following:

----
openssl ciphers -v 'HIGH'
----

To check the current value of the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment variable, type `printenv` at the Linux prompt: this returns a list of all currently set environment variables.
