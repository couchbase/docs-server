:description: To support secure communications between nodes, clusters, and clients, Couchbase Server provides interfaces for the configuration of on-the-wire security settings.

[abstract]
{description}

[#tls-and-cipher-suites]
== On-the-Wire Security

The interfaces provided by Couchbase Server for configuring on-the-wire security apply to the following areas:

* Accessing the UI provided by Couchbase Web Console.

* Establishing the Cluster Encryption-Level.

* Configuring TLS and Cipher-Suites.

* Enforcing TLS across the cluster.

These areas are described in detail in xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc[On-the-Wire Security], which should be read before the examples provided below are attempted.

[#security-settings]
== On-the-Wire Security Settings

Three configurable, on-the-wire security settings are provided both globally and per service.
They are as follows:

* `tlsMinVersion`.
Specifies the minimum accepted TLS version: the server will not accept client connections with protocols below the level of the established, minimum version.
The value can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2` (the default), or `tlsv1.3`.
+
This parameter can be established both globally and per service.
However, a value of `tlsv1.3` can only be applied to the following services: `data`, `fullTextSearch`, `index`, `eventing`, `query`, `analytics`, and `backup`.

* `honorCipherOrder`.
Specifies whether the service uses its own cipher-suite preference, rather than the client's.
The default value of `honorCipherOrder` is `true`: a setting of `false` is _not_ recommended, since insecure.

* `cipherSuites`.
Specifies a list of the cipher suites to be used by the service, in order of preference.
The argument must be a list of cipher suites, each of which appears as a member of the array that is the value of the non-configurable *supportedCipherSuites* setting for the service.
+
Note that Couchbase Server only accepts _IETF RFC_ names, for cipher-suites: _OpenSSL_ names cannot be used.

A further four, on-the-wire security settings are provided for global configuration only &#8212; thus, these _cannot_ be set per service:

* `disableUIOverHttp`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over http.
The default is that the console _can_ be accessed over http.

* `disableUIOverHttps`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over https.
The default is that the console _can_ be accessed over https.

* `disableWWWAuthenticate`.
Whether to disable Couchbase Server's responding to unauthenticated requests with _WWW-Authenticate_.
The default is _not_ to disable.

* `clusterEncryptionLevel`.
Controls the level of encryption imposed on cluster-communications.
This can only be set after cluster encryption has been enabled: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption].
Its value can be any of the following:

** `control`, meaning that server-management information passed between nodes is passed in encrypted form.

** `all`, meaning that all information passed between nodes, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form.

** `strict`, meaning `all` with only encrypted communication permitted between nodes and between the cluster and external clients.
Note, however, that after `strict` has been specified, communication that occurs entirely on a single node using the _loopback_ interface (whereby the machine is identified as either `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) is still permitted in non-encrypted form.

[#manage-on-the-wire-security-with-the-cli]
== Manage On-the-Wire Security, with the CLI

The Couchbase CLI allows cluster-wide on-the-wire security-settings to be retrieved; and allows the _global_ settings to be established and modified.

[#get-cluster-wide-settings-with-the-cli]
=== Get Cluster-Wide Settings, with the CLI

The _cluster-wide_ security configuration includes both _global_ and _per service_ settings.
The current configuration can be retrieved with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] command.
This is shown by the following example.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq^] command, to optimise the output's readability:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c 10.144.210.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get | jq '.'
----

If successful, the command returns output such as the following:

----

    ]
  }
}
----

The returned object contains attribute-value pairs that represent the current cluster-wide on-the-wire security configuration.

For information on the first three attributes shown in this example &#8212;   `disableUIOverHttp`, `disableUIOverHttps`, and `disableWWWAuthenticate` &#8212; see the CLI reference page for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security]; and the REST reference page xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

The `tlsMinVersion` is shown as set to `tlsv1`.
The value of `honorCipherOrder` is the default, which is `true`.

No custom cipher-suite list has been provided as the value of `cipherSuites`: accordingly, the array is empty.

The remaining attributes in the object correspond to the services for which on-the-wire security can be configured: `data`, `fullTextSearch`, `index`, `eventing`, `query`, `analytics`, `backup`, and `clusterManager`.
Currently, each contains a single attribute-value pair, specifying `supportedCipherSuites`.
The value of the list, in each case, is a _read-only_ list of cipher-suites (truncated, in the output-display provided above), which is for informational purposes: if a cipher-suite list is to be custom-configured for the service, it must only feature cipher-suites included in the list that is value of `supportedCipherSuites`.

Note that when custom-settings are made either globally or per service, further attribute-value pairs are added to the corresponding subdocuments, and are duly displayed when settings are retrieved.

[#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-cli]
=== Set the Minimum TLS Version Globally, with the CLI

To set the minimum TLS version globally, with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] command as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c 10.144.210.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--tls-min-version tlsv1.1
----

The `set` flag indicates that a value is to be set.
The `tls-min-version` flag specifies the appropriate minimum TLS value, which can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, or `tlsv1.2`; and is in this case specified as `tlsv1.1`.

If successful, the command returns the following success-message:

----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

For more information, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security]

[#set-global-cipher-suite-list-with-the-cli]
=== Set a Global Cipher-Suite List, with the CLI

The global cipher-suite list for the cluster can be established, by means of the CLI.

Enter the following command:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c 10.144.210.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--tls-honor-cipher-order 1 \
--cipher-suites TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA \
--set
----

This establishes that the server's order of cipher-suites is to be honored, and specifies a cipher-suite list of two ciphers.

If the call is successful, the following message is displayed:

----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

Note that since the REST API can be used to establish a cipher-suite list for each individual service, a system of preferences is maintained by Couchbase Server, to determine which setting is used by each service, when multiple settings have been established.
For information, see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc#establishing-cipher-suite-lists[Establishing Cipher-Suite Lists].

[#establish-other-global-settings-with-the-cli]
=== Establish Other Global Settings, with the CLI

As described above, the CLI can also be used to establish global settings for
`disableUIOverHttp`, `disableUIOverHttps`, `disableWWWAuthenticate`, and `clusterEncryptionLevel`.
For information, see the reference page for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-security.adoc[setting-security] command.

[#manage-on-the-wire-security-with-the-rest-api]
== Manage On-the-Wire Security with the REST API

The Couchbase REST API allows cluster-wide on-the-wire security-settings to be retrieved; and allows _global_ and _per service_ settings to be established and modified.
Use the `GET` and `POST` HTTP methods, with the `/settings/security/[service-name]` URI.

For more information on all REST API calls shown here, see the reference page xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

[#get-cluster-wide-settings-with-the-rest-api]
=== Get Cluster-Wide Settings, with the REST API

The following expression uses `GET /settings/security` to return the current, cluster-wide on-the-wire security settings, for the cluster:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security  | jq
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and an object that contains the current settings.
For an example of this object, and a description of its elements, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#get-cluster-wide-settings-with-the-cli[Get Cluster-Wide Settings, with the CLI], above.


[#set-the-minimum-tls-version-with-the-rest-api]
=== Set the Minimum TLS Version Globally, with the REST API

To set the minimum TLS version globally, with the REST API, use the `POST /settings/security` method and URI, as follows:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security \
-d 'tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.1'
----

The `tlsMinVersion` flag specifies the minimum TLS version to be used; which can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2` (which is the default), or `tlsv1.3`; and is in this case specified as `tlsv1.1`
If successful, the command gives a `200 OK` message, and returns an empty array.

[#set-global-cipher-suite-list-with-the-rest-api]
=== Set a Global Cipher-Suite List, with the REST API

To establish a global cipher-suite list, and specify whether to honor the server's or the client's cipher-suite preference, enter the following:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security \
-d honorCipherOrder=true \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"]'
----

The `honorCipherOrder` flag is specified as `true`, meaning that the server's order of preference for cipher-suites, rather than the client's, will be used.
(Note, however, that `true` is the default; meaning that the server's preference is used even if this parameter is not specified.)
The value specified for the `cipherSuites` flag is a list of cipher-suites that can be used for the server, in order of preference.
If the value for `cipherSuites` is an empty list (`[]`), no global cipher-suite list is established: for information on default cipher-suite lists used by individual services, see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc[On-the-Wire Security].

If successful, the call gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

[#establish-other-global-settings-with-the-rest-api]
=== Establish Other Global Settings, with the REST API

As described above, the REST API can also be used to establish global settings for
`disableUIOverHttp`, `disableUIOverHttps`, `disableWWWAuthenticate`, and `clusterEncryptionLevel`.
For information, see xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc[Configure On-the-Wire Security].

[#configure-on-the-wire-security-per-service-with-the-rest-api]
=== Configure On-the-Wire Security Per Service, with the REST API

Using the REST API, the `tlsMinVersion`, `honorCipherOrder`, and `cipherSuites` parameters can be configured _per service_.
This requires that the appropriate `service-name` be appended to the URI.
The value of `service-name` can be any one of the following: `data` (Data Service), `fullTextSearch` (Search Service), `index` (Index Service), `eventing` (Eventing Service), `query` (Query Service), `analytics` (Analytics Service), `backup` (Backup Service), `clusterManager` (Cluster Manager).

For example, the following call sets these parameters for the Data Service alone:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.144.210.101.:8091/settings/security/data \
-d honorCipherOrder=true \
-d tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.1 \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA", "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"]'
----

If successful, the call returns an empty array.
To check the current settings, use the `GET` method, with the `/settings/security/data` URI, as follows:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security/data  | jq
----

If successful, this call returns `200 OK`, and an object containing the current settings for the Data Service.
For example:

----
{
  "cipherSuites": [
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
  ],
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1.1",
  "honorCipherOrder": true,
  "supportedCipherSuites": [
    "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
    "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
              .
              .
              .
----

The current `cipherSuites` list for the service is thus shown to have been appropriately updated.
