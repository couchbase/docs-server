[#examples-on-this-page-manage-sessions]
== Examples on This Page

The examples on this page indicate how to manage sessions by means of the
UI and REST API respectively. Sessions cannot be managed with the CLI.

[#access-security-screen]
== Manage Sessions with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access the *Security* screen of Couchbase Web Console, by left-clicking
on the *Security* tab, in the right-hand navigation bar:
+
[#access-security-screen-image]
image::manage-security/accessSecurityScreen.png[,90,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Security* screen, which appears as follows:
+
[#couchbase-security-view]
image::manage-security/securityView.png[,800,align=left]

. Access the *Sessions* display, by left-clicking on the *Sessions* tab, on
the upper, horizontal control-bar:
+
[#access-sessions-tab]
image::manage-security/sessionsTab.png[,142,align=left]
+
This displays the *Sessions* panel, which appears as follows:
+
[#access-sessions-panel]
image::manage-security/sessionsPanelInitial.png[,320,align=left]

The interactive pane accepts integers, representing minutes of
user-inactivity that are allowed to elapse before the user-session
times out, and the login screen is displayed. Either enter the required
number of minutes with the keyboard, or use the interactive control:

[#session-timeout-panel-with-change]
image::manage-security/sessionTimeoutPanelwithChange.png[,320,align=left]

Note that 0 seconds, which is the default, specifies that no timeout is
applied.

[#manage-sessions-with-rest-api]
== Manage Sessions with the REST API

Use the `/settings/security` URI, with the `uiSessionTimeout` flag specifying
the number of _seconds_ to elapse, as follows:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/settings/security \
-d "uiSessionTimeout=600"
----
