[abstract]
Actions performed on Couchbase Server can be _audited_.
This allows administrators to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately performed.

== Audit Records and Their Content

The records created by the Couchbase Auditing facililty capture information on _who_ has performed _what_ action, _when_, and _how_ successfully.
The records are created by Couchbase Server-processes, which run asynchronously.
Each record is stored as a JSON document, which can be retrieved and inspected.

A complete list of auditable events, and an analysis of the _audit fields_
recorded, can be found in
xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].

== Audit Configuration

Auditing can be configured by the *Full Admin* and *Security Admin* roles, and read by the *Read-Only Admin* role, using Couchbase Web Console.
Proceed as follows.

Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar, at the left-hand side of the Dashboard:

[#security-tab-with-hand-cursor]
image::manage-security/securityTabWithHandCursor.png[,110,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Security* screen, which appears as follows:

[#security-view-initial-no-users]
image::manage-security/securityViewInitialNoUsers.png[,820,align=left]

The initial, default view is for [.ui]*Users*.
To select auditing, left-click on the [.ui]*Audit* tab, on the horizontal control-bar, near the top:

[#audit-tab]
image::manage-security/auditTab.png[,140,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Audit* view:

[#audit-view]
image::manage-security/auditView.png[,400,align=left]

To enable auditing, check the [.ui]*Audit events & write them to a log* checkbox:

[#enable-auditing]
image::manage-security/enableAuditing.png[,480,align=left]

This makes the default pathname within the [.ui]*Audit Log Directory* text-field editable.
For Linux, the pathname is `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; for Windows, `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs`; for MacOS, `/Users/couchbase/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`.

If you wish to modify the pathname, enter the appropriate content.
Records will be saved to the directory you specify.
Note the advisory message now visible beneath the checkbox: as this indicates, electing to audit a wide range of events may significantly impact performance and consume disk-space.

The [.ui]*Log Rotation* `time interval & size trigger` determines at what times stored log files — referred to as _targets_ — are _rotated_: this means that the current default file, to which records are being written, named `audit.log`, is saved under a new name, which features an appended timestamp.
For example: _usermachinename_`.local-2017-03-16T15-42-18-audit.log`.
Note that rotated log files are never deleted by Couchbase Server: if deletion is appropriate, this must be handled explicitly by the administrator.

The number of time-units is specified by changing the number `1`, which appears in the interactive field by default.
The time-unit type is specified by means of the pull-down menu, at the right-hand side of the field:

[#set-rotation-time-interval]
image::manage-security/setRotationTimeInterval.png[,290,align=left]

Note that the value you establish must be from 15 minutes to 7 days.

Log rotation can also be specified by means of a _size trigger_: this can be edited, in the interactive field to the right of the *Log Rotation* pane.
The default value is 20, and the units are megabytes.

== Filterable Events

Events can be _filtered_ for the Data Service, the Query and Index Services, the Eventing Service, and the Analytics Service.
_Filtering_ means _selective logging_.

To view filterable events for the Data Service, first, ensure that logging is generally enabled, by checking the *Audit events & write them to a log* checkbox.
Then, left-click on the right-pointing arrowhead adjacent to *Data Service*.
The *Data Service* events panel opens, as follows:

[#eventFilteringUIdataServiceInitial]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringUIdataServiceInitial.png[,720,align=left]

This shows that currently, no Data Service events are to be logged.
To elect to log all such events, move the *enable all* toggle to the right:

[#eventFilteringToggle]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringToggle.png[,160,align=left]

The panel now appears as follows:

[#eventFilteringUIdataServiceEnabled]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringUIdataServiceEnabled.png[,720,align=left]

Every checkbox appears selected, indicating that each corresponding event will be logged.
To de-select individual events, simply uncheck the appropriate checkboxes.

In some cases, it may not be desirable to log events incurred by particular users: for example, authentication performed by the Full Administrator.
These users can be specified in the *Ignore Filterable Events From These Users* field.
As the placeholder indicates, specification should take the form _username_`/external` or _username_`/couchbase`, according to the domain in which the user is registered.
(See
xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication], for information on authentication domains.) Left-click on the *Save* button, to save the list of users.

== Configuring with CLI

For information on configuring audit with the Couchbase command-line interface, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-audit.adoc[setting-audit].

== Understanding Audit Events

_Audit events_ are defined by Couchbase, and are automatically generated when auditing is enabled, in correspondence with defined actions.
Corresponding data is written to target-files.
For a list of events, see the section xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].
