== Audit Records and Their Content

The records created by the Couchbase Auditing facililty capture information on _who_ has performed _what_ action, _when_, and _how_ successfully.
The records are created by Couchbase Server-processes, which run asynchronously.
Each record is stored as a JSON document, which can be retrieved and inspected.

Auditing can be configured by the *Full Admin* and *Security Admin* roles, and read by the *Read-Only Admin* role.

A conceptual overview of event auditing can be found in xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].
See the reference page xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc[Audit Event Reference], for a complete list of the events that can be audited.

== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to manage auditing using the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc#managing-auditing-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc#managing-auditing-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc#managing-auditing-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.

[#managing-auditing-with-the-ui]
== Manage Auditing with the UI

Proceed as follows.

Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar, at the left-hand side of the Dashboard:

[#security-tab-with-hand-cursor]
image::manage-security/securityTabWithHandCursor.png[,110,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Security* screen, which appears as follows:

[#security-view-initial-no-users]
image::manage-security/securityView.png[,820,align=left]

The initial, default view is for [.ui]*Users*.
To select auditing, left-click on the [.ui]*Audit* tab, on the horizontal control-bar, near the top:

[#audit-tab]
image::manage-security/auditTab.png[,120,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Audit* view:

[#audit-view]
image::manage-security/auditView.png[,400,align=left]

To enable auditing, move the [.ui]*Audit events & write them to a log* toggle to the right:

[#enable-auditing]
image::manage-security/enableAuditing2.png[,480,align=left]

This makes the default pathname within the [.ui]*Audit Log Directory* text-field editable.
For Linux, the pathname is `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; for Windows, `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs`; for MacOS, `/Users/couchbase/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`.

If you wish to modify the pathname, enter the appropriate content.
Records will be saved to the directory you specify.
Note the advisory message now visible beneath the checkbox: as this indicates, electing to audit a wide range of events may significantly impact performance and consume disk-space.

The [.ui]*Log Rotation* `time interval & size trigger` determines at what times stored log files — referred to as _targets_ — are _rotated_: this means that the current default file, to which records are being written, named `audit.log`, is saved under a new name, which features an appended timestamp.
For example: `_usermachinename_.local-2017-03-16T15-42-18-audit.log`.
Note that rotated log files are never deleted by Couchbase Server: if deletion is appropriate, this must be handled explicitly by the administrator.

The number of time-units is specified by changing the number `1`, which appears in the interactive field by default.
The time-unit type is specified by means of the pull-down menu, at the right-hand side of the field:

[#set-rotation-time-interval]
image::manage-security/setRotationTimeInterval.png[,290,align=left]

Note that the value you establish must be from 15 minutes to 7 days.

Log rotation can also be specified by means of a _size trigger_: this can be edited, in the interactive field to the right of the *Log Rotation* pane.
The default value is 20, and the units are megabytes.

== Managing Events

Couchbase Server supports both _filterable_ and _non-filterable_ events.
To understand the difference between these, see xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#filterable-and-non-filterable-events[Filterable and Non-Filterable Events].

Couchbase Web Console allows the user to enable event-auditing for the node; to enable filterable events per module; to disable filterable events individually, within each module; and to ignore all filterable events for specified local, external, and _internal_ (system) users.

To view all filterable and non-filterable events for (for example) the Data Service, first, ensure that logging is enabled for the node, by checking the *Audit events & write them to a log* checkbox.
Then, left-click on the right-pointing arrowhead adjacent to *Data Service*.
The *Data Service* events panel opens, as follows:

[#eventFilteringUIdataServiceInitial]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringUIdataServiceInitial.png[,720,align=left]

The *enable all* toggle for the Data Service is currently in the leftward position.
Data Service events are each represented by an _event name_ (such as *opened DCP connection*), adjacent to a checkbox; with an _event description_ at the right.

All are currently greyed out, since Data Service events have not been enabled.
Note, however, that some of the events feature checkboxes that are _already checked_.
This means that these events are _non-filterable_, and have already been enabled, due to the enablement of events for the node.
Inspection of the panels provided for other modules, such as *Query and Index Service*, and *Eventing Service*, will likewise show subsets of checked, and therefore enabled, _non-filterable_ events.

To elect to audit _all_ the events for the Data Service &#8212; that is, filterable as well as non-filterable &#8212; move the *enable all* toggle for the Data Service panel to the right:

[#eventFilteringToggle]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringToggle.png[,160,align=left]

The panel now appears as follows:

[#eventFilteringUIdataServiceEnabled]
image::manage-security/eventFilteringUIdataServiceEnabled.png[,720,align=left]

Every checkbox now appears selected, indicating that each corresponding event will be logged.
To de-select one or more of the individual _filterable_ events, simply uncheck the corresponding checkboxes.
The _non-filterable_ events cannot be individually disabled, and so remain greyed-out.

[#ignoring-events-by-user]
=== Ignoring Filterable Events By User

In some cases, it may be unnecessary to log filterable events incurred by particular users: for example, authentication performed by the Full Administrator.
These users can be specified in the *Ignore Events From These Users* field, which appears as follows:

image::manage-security/ignoreUserEventsField.png[,480,align=left]

As the placeholder indicates, specification should take the form `_username_/external` or `_username_/couchbase`, according to the domain in which the user is registered.
Multiple names should be comma-separated.

See xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc[Authentication Domains], for information on authentication domains.

The following Couchbase _internal users_ may also be specified in the *Ignore Events From These Users* field:

[cols="2,2,2,2"]
|===
| @eventing | @cbq-engine | @ns_server | @index
| @projector | @goxdcr | @fts | @cbas
|===

Each internal user should be specified in the form `@_internalusername_/couchbase`.

For each user specified in the field, all filterable events will be ignored.
Non-filterable events, however, will continue to be audited.

Left-click on the *Save* button, to save the configuration.

[#managing-auditing-with-the-cli]
== Managing Auditing with the CLI

To manage auditing with the Couchbase CLI, use the `setting-audit` command, as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-audit \
--cluster 10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--set \
--audit-enabled 1 \
--audit-log-path '/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs' \
--audit-log-rotate-interval 86400 \
--audit-log-rotate-size 104857600
----

This enables auditing for the current node, by specifying a value of `1` for the `audit-enabled` parameter.
(Specifying `0` would disable auditing for the current node.)
A pathname is specified as the value of `audit-log-path`, indicating the location for the `audit.log` file.
An `audit-log-rotate-interval` of `86400` seconds (24 hours) is specified, as is an `audit-log-rotate-size` of `104857600` byes (100 MB).

If the call is successful, the following message is displayed:

----
SUCCESS: Audit settings modified
----

For more information on configuring audit with the Couchbase command-line interface, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-audit.adoc[setting-audit].

[#managing-auditing-with-the-rest-api]
== Managing Auditing with the REST API

The Couchbase REST API provides three endpoints whereby auditing can be managed.
Full details are provided in xref:rest-api:rest-auditing.adoc[Configure Auditing].

Filterable events are referred to with individual _ids_, as well as by name, description, and module.
A complete list can be displayed by means of the `GET /settings/audit/descriptors` http method and URI.
In the following example, output is piped to the http://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq] program, to facilitate readability.

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/audit/descriptors | jq
----

If successful, the call returns an array of objects, each of which contains identifying information for a filterable event:

----
[
  {
    "id": 8243,
    "name": "mutate document",
    "module": "ns_server",
    "description": "Document was mutated via the REST API"
  },
  {
    "id": 8255,
    "name": "read document",
    "module": "ns_server",
    "description": "Document was read via the REST API"
  },
  {
    "id": 8257,
    "name": "alert email sent",
    "module": "ns_server",
    "description": "An alert email was successfully sent"
  },
          .
          .
          ,
----

Each element in the array thus features the `id, `name`, `module`, and `description` of a filterable event.

The `POST /settings/audit` http method and URI can be used to modify the current audit configuration.
For example:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/audit \
-d auditdEnabled=true \
-d disabled=8243,8255,8257,32770,32771,32772,32780,32783,32784,32785,32786,40963 \
-d disabledUsers=testuser/local,@eventing/local,@cbq-engine/local \
-d rotateSize=524288000 \
-d rotateInterval=7200 \
-d logPath='/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs'
----

Here, auditing for the node is enabled, by specifying a value of `true` for the `auditEnabled` parameter.
A comma-separated list of audit-event _ids_ is provided as the value for the `disabled` parameter; indicating that each corresponding filterable event will be disabled.
Likewise, a list of `disabledUsers` is specified.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc#ignoring-events-by-user[Ignoring Filterable Events By User], above, for information.
Note, however, that when specified using the REST API, local and internal usernames take the `/local`, rather than the `/couchbase` suffix.
The `rotateSize` is specified in bytes, and the `rotateInterval` in seconds.

See xref:rest-api:rest-auditing.adoc[Configure Auditing], for more detailed information; including use of the `GET /settings/audit` method and URI to retrieve the current audit configuration.
