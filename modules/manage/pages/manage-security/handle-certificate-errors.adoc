= Handle Certificate Errors

[abstract]
Specific errors can arise from use of X.509 certificates: these should be
recognized and appropriately dealt with.

[#cluster-certificate-errors]
== Cluster Certificate Errors

The following error messages may be encountered when configuring the cluster
CA certificate:

|===
| Couchbase Error Message | Description | Suggested User Action

| `Certificate should not be empty`
| This error message can occur if the request body of the certificate is empty.
| Open the certificate file, and verify whether it is empty or not.
The certificate file should be readable using openssl or via online SSL tools such as https://www.sslchecker.com/certdecoder[sslchecker^].

| `Certificate is not valid at this time`
| This error message can occur if the certificate has expired, or is not yet valid.
| Verify whether the certificate validity-dates (begins on, and expires on) are currently valid corresponding to the server clock time.

| `Malformed certificate`
| This error message can occur due to many reasons - an extra space in the certificate digest body, incorrect certificate format, and so on.
| Use a properly configured certificate, and make sure itâ€™s readable, using `openssl`.
It should look as follows: Certificate begins with

`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`

and ends with

`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`

on a new line with no spaces before or after.

| `Only one certificate per request is allowed`
| Appears when the file contains more than one key or certificate.
| Open the `.pem` file, and make sure that it has only a single certificate digest (such as single `BEGIN CERTIFICATE,` `END CERTIFICATE` pragmas).

| `Encrypted certificates are not supported`
| This error message can occur if you are trying to load a certificate that is encrypted.
Verify by opening the certificate file.
If you see something similar to the line shown below, you will know your certificate is encrypted.:

`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
a|
Couchbase does not support encrypted certificates.
Decrypt the certificate with `openssl` before loading the certificate in Couchbase.

[source,bash]
----
openssl rsa -in privateKey.pem -out newPrivateKey.pem
----

| `Invalid certificate type: ~s`
| Appears when a header other than `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` has been found.
| Open the certificate file, and verify whether it is a valid certificate.
The certificate file should be readable using `openssl` or via online SSL tools such as https://www.sslchecker.com/certdecoder[sslchecker^].

[#node-certificate-errors]
== Node Certificate Errors

The following error messages may be encountered when configuring the node
certificate:

|===
| Couchbase Error Message | Description | Suggested User Action

| `Cluster CA needs to be set before setting node certificate`
| This error can occur when your cluster is still using the self-generated certificate, and you are attempting to configure a node certificate.
| Set up the cluster CA certificate before configuring the per node certificate.

| `Incorrectly configured certificate chain.
<Error>`
| Denotes an invalid certificate in the chain file when configuring Couchbase.
| Chain file should contain a sequence of PEM (base64) encoded X.509 certificates ordered from leaf to and including the intermediate certificate authorities.

| `Unable to read private key file <Path>.
<Error>`
| `<Error>` is one of the file read errors.
| Make sure that you have copied an unencrypted version of the private key file to the inbox folder on the Couchbase node.

| `Unable to read certificate chain file <Path>.
<Error>`
| `<Error>` is one of the file read errors.
| Make sure that you have copied an unencrypted version of the chain file to the inbox folder on the Couchbase node.

| `Invalid private key type: <Type>`
| The private key has an unsupported header.
| Make sure that you use a valid private key file.

| `Provided certificate doesn't match provided private key`
| The certificate doesn't recognize the message signed with a private key.
| Be sure that you use a complete key pair

| `Encrypted keys are not supported`
| The private key is encrypted.
| Couchbase does not support encrypted keys.
You should decrypt the private key with OpenSSL before loading the certificate in Couchbase.

| `Provided private key contains incorrect number of entries`
| The private key is a chain of entries.
| The private key file should contain a single key digest.

| `Malformed or unsupported private key format`
| The private key cannot be used.
| Open the key file, and verify whether it is a valid private key.
The certificate file should be readable using `openssl`.

| `File does not exist`
| The file is missing, does not exist.
| Add the missing file.

| `Missing permission for reading the file, or for searching one of the parent directories`
| You don't have the proper permissions to read the file or to search its parent directories.
| Change the permissions to allow you to read the file.
