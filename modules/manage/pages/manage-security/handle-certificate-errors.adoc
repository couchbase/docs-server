[#cluster-certificate-errors]
== Root Certificate Errors

The following error messages may be encountered when configuring a CA certificate.
For examples of using the `openssl` command to generate and inspect certificates, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].

|===
| Couchbase Error Message | Description | Suggested User Action

| `CA certificate for this chain is not found in the list of trusted CA's`
| The CA certificate used to sign the node certificate is not in the cluster's trust store.
| Copy the CA into the `inbox/CA` directory, then load all trusted CAs.

| `Couldn't load CA certificate from <pathname>/inbox/CA. The file does not exist.`
| The CA certificate was not copied into the `inbox/CA` directory, before the attempt to load it was made.
| Copy the CA certificate into the `inbox/CA` directory, then load the CA certificate.

| `Certificate should not be empty`
| The request body of the certificate is empty.
| Inspect the certificate file using the `openssl` command, and verify whether it is empty or not.

| `Certificate is not valid at this time`
| The certificate either has expired, or is not yet valid.
| Inspect the certificate file using the `openssl` command, and verify whether the certificate's validity-dates (`Not Before`, and `Not After`) are currently valid, in correspondence with server-clock time.

| `Malformed certificate`
| The certificate contains incorrect content.
| Check the validity of the certificate, using `openssl`, and if necessary, create a new certificate.

| `Only one certificate per request is allowed`
| The file inappropriately contains more than one key or certificate.
| Inspect the certificate, and recreate if necessary.

| `Invalid certificate type: ~s`
| Appears when a header other than `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` has been found.
| Inspect the certificate, and verify its validity.
Recreate the certificate if necessary

[#node-certificate-errors]
== Node Certificate Errors

The following error messages may be encountered when configuring and deploying the node
certificate:

|===
| Couchbase Error Message | Description | Suggested User Action

| `Unable to read private key file <pathname>/inbox/pkey.key. The file does not exist.``
| The private key is not in the `inbox` directory.
| Ensure that the private key for the node certificate has been copied to the `inbox` folder of the current node.

| `Unable to read private key file <pathname>/inbox/pkey.key. Missing permission for reading the file, or for searching one of the parent directories.``
| The private key is in the `inbox` directory, but is not owned by user `couchbase`.
| Change ownership of the private key, so that it is owned by user `couchbase`.

| `Incorrectly configured certificate chain`
| Denotes an invalid certificate in the chain file.
| The chain file should contain a sequence of PEM (base64) encoded X.509 certificates, starting from the node certificate, and including all intermediate certificates that exist, in the order of signing.

| `Invalid private key type`
| The private key has an unsupported header.
| Make sure that a valid private key file has been created and copied to the inbox of the current node.

| `Provided certificate doesn't match provided private key`
| The certificate does not recognize the message signed with a private key.
| Be sure that the mutually corresponding private key and chain file are being used.

| `Provided private key contains incorrect number of entries`
| The private key inappropriately contains more than one entry.
| The private key file should contain only a single entry.

| `Malformed or unsupported private key format`
| The private key cannot be used, due to an inappropriate format.
| Inspect the private key, verify whether it is valid; and recreate if necessary.

| `File does not exist`
| The file is missing, does not exist.
| Add the missing file.

| `Missing permission for reading the file, or for searching one of the parent directories`
| Current permissions do not permit the reading of the file or the searching of its parent directories.
| Change the permissions to permit reading and searching.

| `Cannot validate certificate for _<ip-address>_ because it doesn't contain any IP SANs`
| The node certificate does not contain the required IP-address _Subject Alternative Name_.
| Recreate the node certificate, specifying the appropriate Subject Alternative Name.
See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].

| `Certificate is valid for _<ip-address-1>_, not <ip-address-2>`
| The node certificate contains an incorrect IP-address _Subject Alternative Name_.
| Recreate the node certificate, specifying the the correct IP-address Subject Alternative Name.
See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].
