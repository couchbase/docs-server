[#couchbase-client-authentication]
== Couchbase Client Authentication

Couchbase clients can authenticate by means of X.509 certificates.
This page provides step-by-step instructions for the creation of client certificates for:

* _Couchbase Server_.
The certificate can be used by a Couchbase Server-cluster that wishes to secure its connection to another Couchbase Server-cluster.
This certificate might be used by a _source_ cluster that wishes to perform _Cross Data Center Replication_ securely, to a _destination_ cluster.

* _Java Applications_.
A Java application based on the Couchbase SDK can obtain its client certificate from a Java _keystore_, and so authenticate with Couchbase Server securely.

For a list of Couchbase-Server ports that provide secure connectivity to clients, see
xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc[Connectivity].

[#cert-auth-for-couchbase-server]
== Configure Client Certificates for Couchbase Server

The section contains two procedures for the creation of a client certificate and key, whereby authentication with Couchbase Server can be performed:

* xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#client-certificate-authorized-by-a-root-certificate[Client Access: Root-Certificate Authorization] shows how to create a client certificate that is authorized by a cluster's root certificate.
The procedure for creating the cluster's root certificate (and, based on the root certificate, the cluster's individual per node certificates), is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root and Node Certificates].
The instructions on the current page assume that _that_ procedure has already been followed: therefore, they duly make use of the previously created directory structure and files.

* xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#client-certificate-authorized-by-an-intermediate-certificate[Client Access: Intermediate-Certificate Authorization] shows how to create a client certificate that is authorized by an _intermediate_ certificate; which derives its own authority from the cluster's root certificate; and which is used instead of the root for the signing of the client certificate.
The procedure for creating the cluster's root, server-intermediate and per node certificates is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-intermediate-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate, and Node Certificates].
The instructions on the current page assume that _that_ procedure has already been followed: therefore, they duly make use of the previously created directory structure and files.

[#assumptions]
Both procedures additionally assume that the instance of Couchbase Server to be accessed by the client:

* Contains the sample bucket `travel-sample`: this is the bucket whose contents the client wishes to read and write.
For information on sample buckets and how to install them, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

* Has a defined, locally authenticated user named `clientuser`, who has been assigned a role that permits reading and writing to the `travel-sample` bucket.
For information on creating users and roles, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].

* Has client-certificate handling configured as either _enabled_ or _mandatory_.
For details, see xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc[Enable Client-Certificate Handling].

Note that additional information on file-types can be found in the procedures for _server_-certificate generation; in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].

[#client-certificate-authorized-by-a-root-certificate]
=== Client Access: Root-Certificate Authorization

Proceed as follows:

. Within the top-level directory created in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root and Node Certificates], create and access a new working directory.
+
----
cd servercertfiles
mkdir clientcertfiles
cd clientcertfiles
----

. Create an extensions file for the use of all clients.
+
----
cat > client.ext <<EOF
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
keyUsage = digitalSignature
EOF
----
+
This specifies a value of `FALSE` for `CA`, indicating that the client certificate will not have the ability to act as an authority for other certificates.
Its `extendedKeyUsage` is specified as `clientAuth`, indicating that the certificate will be used for authenticating a client.
It `keyUsage` is specified as `digitalSignature`, indicating that its public key is usable for data-origin authentication.
+
This extensions file thus contains definitions judged appropriate for all clients.
Further constraints can be added for individual clients, as necessary.

. Create a client private key.
+
----
openssl genrsa -out ./travel-sample.key 2048
----
+
This creates the private key `travel-sample.key`.

. Generate the client-certificate signing-request.
+
----
openssl req -new -key ./travel-sample.key -out ./travel-sample.csr -subj "/CN=clientuser"
----
+
The client's private key, `travel-sample.key` is provided as input for the signing request.
The _Common Name_ provided as `Subject` for the certificate is specified as `clientuser`, which is the name of the server-defined user to be authenticated by the client.
The output request-file, `travel-sample.csr` is saved in the current directory.

. Optionally, customize a client extensions file, to identify a _username_ to be authenticated.
+
As described in xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Specifying Usernames for Client-Certificate Authentication], a client certificate should contain a username, against which authentication can be performed on Couchbase Server.
The server's default handling assumes that the _Subject Common Name_ specifies the username.
However, a _Subject Alternative Name_ might be used; either in addition, or as an alternative.
+
The following `subjectAltName` statement allows an email address to be specified as the basis for the username.
+
----
cp ./client.ext ./client.ext.tmp

echo "subjectAltName = email:john.smith@mail.com" \
>> ./client.ext.tmp
----
+
If Couchbase Server is configured to search for an email address to be used as a username (as described in xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Specifying Usernames for Client-Certificate Authentication] and xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc[Enable Client-Certificate Handling]), the user `john.smith` will be submitted for authentication.
+
If this extension is _not_ added, and Couchbase Server client-certificate handling is left at its default, the _Common Name_ (which was specified as `clientuser`, when the client-certificate signing-request was generated) will continue to be used as the username.

. Create the client certificate.
In this example, the customized extensions file, `client.ext.tmp`, is used.
However, if no email address or other Subject Alternative Name has been added, the generic client-extensions file, `client.ext`, can be used instead.
+
----
openssl x509 -CA ../ca.pem -CAkey ../ca.key \
-CAcreateserial -days 365 -req -in ./travel-sample.csr \
-out ./travel-sample.pem -extfile ./client.ext.tmp
----
+
The root certificate for the cluster, and its corresponding private key, `ca.pem` and `ca.key` are specified as inputs for certificate generation, so establishing the root certificate's authority, within the client certificate.
The output file, `travel-sample.pem`, is the client certificate, and is saved in `clientcertfiles`.
+
The confirmatory output is as follows:
+
----
Signature ok
subject=/CN=clientuser
Getting CA Private Key
----
+
This concludes the process.
The client can now use `travel-sample.pem` to authenticate itself as having the authority of `ca.pem` (which is shared by the server it intends to access); and provides the username of `clientuser` (which the server associates with a role appropriate for access to the `travel-sample` bucket).
The client key, `travel-sample.key`, can be used for digital signing.
+
A possible use case for the client certificate thus generated is described below, in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#using-client-and-server-certificates-for-secure-xdcr[Using Client and Server Certificates for Secure XDCR].

[#client-certificate-authorized-by-an-intermediate-certificate]
=== Client Access: Intermediate-Certificate Authorization

The following procedure demonstrates how an _intermediate_ certificate, with the authority of the _root_ certificate, can be created in order itself to sign _client_ certificates.
The procedure assumes that the server-equivalent procedure described in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-intermediate-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate, and Node Certificates] has already been followed; and that the resulting directory-structure is still available.

Proceed as follows:

. Access the `servercertfiles2/root` directory, created in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-intermediate-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate, and Node Certificates].
+
----
cd servercertfiles2/root
----

. Create an encrypted private key and a certificate signing request, for an intermediate certificate that is to be used for signing client certificates.
+
----
openssl req -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ../clients/ca.key \
-out reqs/client-signing.csr \
-subj '/C=UA/O=MyCompany/OU=People/CN=ClientSigningCA'
----
+
Since this specifies that an encrypted private key be created, prompts appear requesting entry of an appropriate _pass phrase_.
Enter an appropriate phrase against the prompts.
+
This new private key is named `../clients/ca.key`.
The signing-request file is saved as `reqs/client-signing.csr`.

. Create the intermediate certificate to be used for client-certificate signing.
+
----
openssl x509 -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial.srl \
-days 3650 -req -in reqs/client-signing.csr -out issued/client-signing.pem \
-extfile ca.ext
----
+
The root certificate and key for the cluster, `ca.pem` and `ca.key`, are specified as the authority for the intermediate certificate.
Since `ca.key` is an encrypted key, a prompt appears, requesting that the appropriate pass phrase be entered: enter the appropriate phrase.
+
Note that the extension file used here to constrain the capabilities of the intermediate certificate is that created in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#create-intermediate-extensions-file[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate, and Node Certificates].

. Save the intermediate certificate as the certificate-authority for the client certificate that is to be created.
+
----
cp issued/client-signing.pem ../clients/ca.pem
----

. Within the `../clients` directory, create an extension file for the client certificate:
+
----
cd ../clients

cat > client.ext <<EOF
basicConstraints = CA:FALSE
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer:always
extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth
keyUsage = digitalSignature
EOF
----
+
The value of `extendedKeyUsage` is specified as `clientAuth`, indicating that the certificate will be used to authenticate a client.
The value of `keyUsage` is specified as `digitalSignature`, indicating that the certificate may be used in the verifying of information-origin.

. Create a private key for the client certificate.
+
----
openssl genrsa -out private/clientuser.key 2048
----

. Create a certificate signing request for the client certificate.
+
----
openssl req -new -key private/clientuser.key -out reqs/clientuser.csr \
-subj "/C=UA/O=MyCompany/OU=People/CN=clientuser"
----
+
The signing request is based on the private key `clientuser.key`.
The username associated with the certificate is specified as `clientuser`: this is the username to be recognized by Couchbase Server, and associated with specific roles.

. Create the client certificate.
+
----
openssl x509 -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -CAserial serial.srl \
-days 365 -req -in reqs/clientuser.csr \
-out issued/clientuser.pem -extfile client.ext
----
+
This creates the client certificate `clientuser.pem`, based on the signing request `clientuser.csr`, and signed with the authority of the intermediate certificate and key, `ca.pem` and `ca.key`.
Since `ca.key` is encrypted, a prompt appears, requesting entry of the appropriate pass phrase: enter the appropriate phrase against the prompt.
The certificate is saved in the `issued` folder.

. Check the validity of the client certificate.
The following use of the `openssl` command verifies the relationship between the root certificate, the client-intermediate certificate, and the client certificate.
+
----
openssl verify -trusted ../root/ca.pem -untrusted ca.pem \
issued/clientuser.pem
----
+
If the certificate is valid, the following output is displayed:
+
----
issued/clientuser.pem: OK
----

. Concatenate the issued client certificate with the client-intermediate certificate, to establish the chain of authority.
+
----
cat issued/clientuser.pem ca.pem > clientuser.pem
----
+
The result of the concatenation, `clientuser.pem` is the completed client certificate.

[#using-client-and-server-certificates-for-secure-xdcr]
=== Using Client and Server Certificates for Secure XDCR

Examples of using the certificates and keys created on this page above and in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates] can be found in the documentation provided for securing _Cross Data Center Replication_, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#specify-full-xdcr-security-with-certificates[Specify Root and Client Certificates, and Client Private Key].
When securing XDCR according to these instructions, use the following files:

* If the procedures explained in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root and Node Certificates] and xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#client-certificate-authorized-by-a-root-certificate[Client Access: Root-Certificate Authorization] have been followed, specify:

** The remote cluster root certificate as `servercertfiles/ca.pem`.
** The client certificate as `servercertfiles/clientcertfiles/travel-sample.pem`.
** The client private key as `servercertfiles/clientcertfiles/travel-sample.key`.

* If the procedures explained in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-intermediate-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate, and Node Certificates] and xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#client-certificate-authorized-by-an-intermediate-certificate[Client Access: Intermediate-Certificate Authorization] have been followed, specify:

** The remote cluster root certificate as `servercertfiles2/root/ca.pem`.
** The client certificate as `servercertfiles2/clients/clientuser.pem`.
** The client private key as `servercertfiles2/clients/private/clientuser.key`.

[#cert_auth_for_java_client]
== Configure Client Certificates for Java Clients

A _Java_ client uses a _keystore_ to access the certificates it requires for authentication.
Certificate and keystore preparation is demonstrated by the procedures in the following two sections, which are:

* xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#java-client-access-root-certificate-authorization[Java Client Access: Root-Certificate Authorization].
This creates a Java-client certificate signed by the cluster's root certificate.
As such, the procedure follows on from the server-certificate creation-process documented in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root and Node Certificates]; and makes use of the directories and keys created there.

* xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#java-client-access-intermediate-certificate-authorization[Java Client Access: Intermediate-Certificate Authorization].
This creates a Java-client certificate signed by the cluster's intermediate certificate.
As such, the procedure follows on from the server-certificate creation-process documented in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-intermediate-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root, Intermediate and Node Certificates]; and makes use of the directories and keys created there.

Note that the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#assumptions[assumptions] specified for the examples above likewise apply to the Java client examples below.

[#java-client-access-root-certificate-authorization]
=== Java Client Access: Root-Certificate Authorization

Proceed as follows:

. Access the main working directory created in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#root-and-node-certificates[Cluster Protection with Root and Node Certificates], and create and access a new working directory for the Java client certificate to be created.
+
----
cd servercertfiles
mkdir javaclient
cd javaclient
----

. Define two environment variables: one for the name of the keystore to be created, another for its password.
+
[source,bash]
----
export KEYSTORE_FILE=my.keystore
export STOREPASS=storepass
----

. If necessary, install a package containing the `keytool` utility:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install openjdk-9-jre-headless
----

. Generate the keystore.
Note that the password you specify for the alias, by means of the `--keypass` flag, must be identical to the password you specify for the keystore, by means of the `--storepass` flag.
In this case, both passwords are specified as `&#36;&#123;STOREPASS&#125;`; which resolves to `storepass`.
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned \
-keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -validity 360 \
-keysize 2048 -noprompt  -dname "CN=clientuser, OU=People, O=MyCompany, \
L=None, S=None, C=UA" -keypass ${STOREPASS}
----
+
Note that the `Common Name` for the certificate is specified as `clientuser`, which is the username established on Couchbase Server, whose role-assignment is supportive of reading and writing data to the `travel-sample` bucket.

. Generate the certificate signing-request:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -certreq -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -file my.csr \
-keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----
+
This creates the signing-request file, `my.csr`.
+
Note that in this example, although only the `Common Name` is being used to establish the identity of the user seeking authorization, one or more `Subject Alternative Names` could also be added.
For example, by adding `-ext "san=email:john.smith@mail.com"` to the certificate signing-request used in the current step, the email-address `john.smith@mail.com` could be established as the basis for an alternative username to be submitted for authentication.
See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Specifying Usernames for Client-Certificate Authentication], for more information.

. Generate the client certificate, signing it with the root private key, and thereby establishing the root certificate's authority:
+
[source,bash]
----
openssl x509 -req -in my.csr -CA ../ca.pem \
-CAkey ../ca.key -CAcreateserial -out clientcert.pem -days 365
----

. Add the root certificate to the keystore:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file ../ca.pem \
-alias root -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Add the client certificate to the keystore:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -file clientcert.pem \
-alias selfsigned -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

This concludes preparation of the Java client's keystore.
Copy the file (in this case, `my.keystore`) to a location on a local filesystem from which the Java client can access it.
A sample Java program, which accesses a keystore from a local filesystem, is provided in  xref:java-sdk:howtos:sdk-authentication.adoc#authenticating-the-java-client-by-certificate[Authenticating a Java Client by Certificate].

[#java-client-access-intermediate-certificate-authorization]

----
+
Note that the Common Name for the certificate is specified as `clientuser`, which is the username established on Couchbase Server, whose role-assignment is supportive of reading and writing data to the `travel-sample` bucket.

. Generate the certificate signing-request:
+
----
keytool -certreq -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -file my.csr \
-keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Generate the client certificate, signing it with the intermediate private key, and thereby establishing the intermediate certificate’s authority:
+
----
openssl x509 -req -in my.csr -CA ../servers/ca.pem \
-CAkey ../servers/ca.key -CAcreateserial -out clientcert.pem -days 365
----
+
Since the intermediate private key was encrypted, a prompt now appears, requesting entry of the pass phrase for the key:
+
----
Enter pass phrase for ../servers/ca.key:
----
+
Enter the pass phrase against the prompt.

. Add the root certificate to the keystore:
+
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file ../root/ca.pem \
-alias root -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Add the intermediate certificate to the keystore:
+
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file ../servers/ca.pem \
-alias root2 -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Add the client certificate to the keystore:
+
----
keytool -import -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -file clientcert.pem \
-alias selfsigned -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

This concludes preparation of the Java client's keystore.
Copy the file (in this case, `my.keystore`) to a location on a local filesystem from which the Java client can access it.
A sample Java program, which accesses a keystore from a local filesystem, is provided in  xref:java-sdk:howtos:sdk-authentication.adoc#authenticating-the-java-client-by-certificate[Authenticating a Java Client by Certificate].

[#enabling-client-security]
== Securing Client Access with TLS

For an application to communicate securely with Couchbase Server, SSL/TLS must be enabled on the client side.
Enablement requires a copy of the certificate used by Couchbase Server: this can be accessed from the Couchbase Web Console, as described in
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-security-settings.adoc#root-certificate-security-screen-display[Root Certificate].

Note that if, at some point, this certificate gets regenerated on the server-side, a copy of the new version must be obtained, and the client re-enabled.
