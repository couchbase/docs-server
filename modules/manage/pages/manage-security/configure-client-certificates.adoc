= Configure Client Certificates

[abstract]
Couchbase Server supports client-authentication by means of X.509
certificates.

[#couchbase-client-authentication]
== Couchbase Client Authentication

Couchbase clients can authenticate by means of X.509 certificates. This
page explains how client certificates can be prepared for a Java client. It
also provides information on TLS levels, and on supported ciphers.

For a list of Couchbase-Server ports that provide secure connectivity to
clients, see
xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc[Connectivity].

[#cert_auth_for_java_client]
== Configure Certificates for a Java Client

Once the root certificate for a Couchbase Server-node has been deployed, a
Java client can authenticate by means of an appropriately prepared keystore,
and so gain access to the Data, Query, and Search Services.

Proceed as follows.
Note that these instructions use the Ubuntu 16 environment previously configured
in
xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure
Server Certificates].

. Define environment variables for the name of the keystore to be created, and its password.
+
[source,bash]
----
export KEYSTORE_FILE=my.keystore
export STOREPASS=storepass
----

. If necessary, install a package containing the `keytool` utility:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install openjdk-9-jre-headless
----

. Within the top-level, `SSLCA` directory that you created, generate the keystore.
Note that the password you specify for the alias, by means of the `--keypass` flag, must be identical to the password you specify for the keystore, by means of the `--storepass` flag.
In this case, both passwords are specified as `&#36;&#123;STOREPASS&#125;`; which resolves to `storepass`.
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias selfsigned \
-keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -validity 360 -keysize 2048 \
-noprompt  -dname "CN=${USERNAME}, OU=None, O=None, L=None, S=None, C=US" -keypass ${STOREPASS}
----

. Generate the certificate signing-request:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -certreq -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -file my.csr \
-keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Generate the client certificate, signing it with the intermediate private key:
+
[source,bash]
----
openssl x509 -req -in my.csr -CA ./${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem \
-CAkey ./${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.key -CAcreateserial -out clientcert.pem -days 365
----

. Add the root certificate to the keystore:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file ./${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.pem \
-alias root -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Add the intermediate certificate to the keystore:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -trustcacerts -file ./${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem \
-alias int -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

. Add the client certificate to the keystore:
+
[source,bash]
----
keytool -import -keystore ${KEYSTORE_FILE} -file clientcert.pem \
-alias selfsigned -storepass ${STOREPASS} -noprompt
----

This concludes preparation of the Java client's keystore.
Copy the file (in this case, `my.keystore`) to a location on a local filesystem
from which the Java client can access it.

[#working-with-supported-protocols]
== Working with Supported Protocols

Couchbase Server client-libraries support client-side encryption, using the
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).
TLS versions 1.0 to 1.2 are supported by default.
The highest-supported version of TLS is recommended.

Optionally, the minimum version of TLS can be set to be 1.2 or higher per
cluster, using
the following command:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval -d "ns_config:set(ssl_minimum_protocol, 'tlsv1.2')"
----

[#enabling-client-security]
== Securing Client-Application Access

For an application to communicate securely with Couchbase Server, SSL/TLS must
be enabled on the client side.
To perform enablement, you must acquire a copy of the certificate used by
Couchbase Server, and then follow the steps appropriate for your client.
Access the certificate from the Couchbase Web Console: see
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-security-settings.adoc#root-certificate-security-screen-display[Root
Certificate].
Note that if, at some point, this certificate gets regenerated on the
server-side, you must obtain a copy of the new version, and re-enable the client.

When a TLS connection is established between a client application and Couchbase
Server running on port 18091, a _handshake_ occurs, as defined by the _TLS
Handshake Protocol_.
As part of this exchange, the client must send to the server a
_cipher-suite list_; which indicates the cipher-suites that the client
supports, in order of preference.
The server replies with a notification of the cipher-suite it has duly
selected from the list.
Additionally, symmetric keys to be used by client and server are selected
by means of the _RSA key-exchange_ algorithm.

[#overriding-supported-ciphers]
== Overriding Supported Ciphers

Couchbase Server uses ciphers that are accepted by default by OpenSSL. The
default behavior employs _high_-security ciphers, built into OpenSSL.

You can override this selection, by setting the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST`
environment variable â€” this must be performed _before_ starting Couchbase Server.
The environment variable can be set in either of the following ways:

* Specify an explicit list of ciphers to be used.
For example:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA,CAMELLIA128-SHA"
----

* Specify ciphers by security-level.
For example, to specify that all ciphers in both _medium_ and _high_ categories
be used, enter the following:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="MEDIUM,HIGH"
----

To display the ciphers available on your Linux platform for a particular security level, use the `openssl` command.
For example, to display the _high_-level ciphers, enter the following:

----
openssl ciphers -v 'HIGH'
----

To check the current value of the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment
variable, type `printenv` at the Linux prompt: this returns a list of all
currently set environment variables.
