= Configure LDAP

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be configured to authenticate the external user by means of LDAP; and to map the LDAP _groups_ of which the user is a member to roles defined on Couchbase Server.

[#understanding-ldap-authentication]
== Understanding LDAP Authentication.

For authentication purposes, Couchbase Server can be configured to use LDAP.
This allows the user, when they attempt to access Couchbase Server by presenting their credentials, to be authenticated by LDAP.
Group information for the authenticated user is fetched from the LDAP server.
Each group is mapped to a Couchbase-Server group, whose assigned roles are granted to the user.

Note that Couchbase Server provides two different ways of setting up LDAP:

* _Native LDAP Support_.
For Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5+, this is the recommended way of setting up LDAP for external authentication.
It provides support for encrypted communication, and for LDAP groups.

* _LDAP Support Based on_ `saslauthd`.
This is maintained for support of legacy LDAP authentication (as established on pre-6.5 versions of Couchbase Server), and for support of PAM-based authentication.

This page provides examples of how to configure _Native LDAP Support_.
For information on configuring `saslauthd`, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure `saslauthd`].
For an overview of Couchbase authentication, and more details on external authentication options, see xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication].

Note that _either_ Native LDAP Support _or_ `saslauthd` must be selected for the cluster.
The two cannot be used simultaneously.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-addition]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to configure Native LDAP Support; using the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* A one-node cluster already exists; and is named after its IP address: `10.143.192.101`.
It is running the Data and Query services, and has the `travel-sample` bucket installed.
(To access and install this, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].)

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Two fully configured LDAP servers are available, at `172.23.124.25` and `172.23.124.25`, each using port `389`.

Each example also shows how to associate Couchbase Server groups with LDAP groups.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-ui]
== Configure LDAP with the UI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, access the *Security* panel, by means of the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#security-tab]
image::manage-security/securityTab.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *Security* screen.
Note the options at the upper right:

[#ldap-and-groups-tabs]
image::manage-security/ldapAndGroupsTabs.png[,200,align=left]

The *LDAP* tab allows an LDAP server to be specified for external authentication.
The *Groups* tab allows definition of _Couchbase-Server groups_, which are to be associated with _LDAP groups_, and which can be assigned Couchbase-Server _roles_.
The *ADD USER* tab allows individual users to be added, and for their authentication to be specified as *external*; allowing their LDAP group-membership to be mapped to one or more Couchbase-Server groups and their assigned roles.

[#configure-an-ldap-server-with-the-ui]
=== Configure an LDAP Server with the UI

To configure an LDAP server with the UI, left-click on the *LDAP* tab, at the upper right of the *Security* screen:

[#left-click-on-ldap-tab]
image::manage-security/leftClickOnLdapTab.png[,70,align=left]

This brings up the *Configure LDAP* dialog:

[#configure-ldap-dialog]
image::manage-security/configureLDAP.png[,520,align=left]

The dialog presents two main panels.
The left panel features options whereby LDAP can be configured.
The right panel features help text, for *LDAP Host Configuration*, *User Authentication*, and *Group Authorization*.

Initially, the left panel displays the following fields:

* *LDAP Hosts*. A comma-separated list of host-names, each of which is an LDAP server on which external authentication is to occur.

* *LDAP port*. The port used on each of the LDAP servers for authentication.

* *Encryption*. Whether the connection with the LDAP server or servers should be encrypted.
Left-click on the control at the right-hand side of the field, to display the pull-down menu:
+
[#encryption-pull-down-menu]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPencryptionPullDownMenu.png[,200,align=left]
+
The options are *None* (to connect without encryption), *TLS* (to connect to a TLS-encrypted port), and *StartTLSExtension* (to upgrade an existing connection).

* *Certificate Validation*. Whether to validate Couchbase Server with the server certificate.
This set of radio-buttons is enabled only if *TLS* or *StartTLSExtension* has been selected from the *Encryption* pull-down menu.
The options are *None*, *Couchbase*, and *Paste Cert*.
If *none* is selected, no certificate validation occurs.
If *Couchbase* is selected, the certificate already installed for the cluster is used for validation.
(See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates] for information.)
If *Paste Cert* is selected, the panel expands vertically, to reveal the *Certificate Text* field:
+
[#certificate-text-field]
image::manage-security/certificateTextField.png[,400,align=left]
+
The text of the appropriate certificate should be copied and pasted into the *Certificate Text* field.

* *Contact LDAP host anonymously*.
This checkbox, if checked, causes Couchbase Server to attempt to contact the LDAP host anonymously.
However, the attempt succeeds only if supported by the LDAP configuration.
Note that neither _user-authentication with the query builder_ nor _group authorization_ (both described below) can be performed anonymously.

* *LDAP DN*.
The LDAP domain name for groups synchronization.

* *Password*.
The password for groups synchronization.

At this point, with data entered, the dialog might appear as follows:

[#configure-ldap-dialog-half-complete]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPhalfComplete.png[,520,align=left]


Optionally, the *Check Network Settings* button can now be left-clicked on.
The tests whether the specified LDAP hosts are accessible across the network.
If one or more servers is not accessible, an error is displayed on the dialog.

The dialog provides the following additional fields:

* *Enable LDAP user authentication*.
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#configure-ldap-dialog-enable-ldap-user-auth-field]
image::manage-security/configureLdapEnableLdapUserAuthField.png[,400,align=left]
+
This provides three options whereby usernames can be mapped on the LDAP server.
The default option is *Template*.
An appropriate template should be entered into the *Template* editable text field.
+
Each of the other options, *LDAP query builder* and *Custom*, likewise provides a vertical expansion of the dialog, to accommodate entry of an appropriate mapping-procedure.
+
*Test User Authentication*, when opened, provides options for testing the authentication of specific users:
+
[#test-user-auth-field]
image::manage-security/testUserAuth.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the username and password for the user, and left-click on *Test User Authentication*.
Notifications confirming success or failure duly appear on the dialog.

* *Enable LDAP group authorization & sync*.
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#configure-dialog-test-groups-query]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPgroupsPanel.png[,400,align=left]
+
The LDAP groups of which a user is a member can be searched for by means either of the *User's attributes* or an *LDAP Query*, each of which is provided as a radio-button option.
Selection of each reveals an appropriate set of fields, in which information can be added.
+
The *Traverse nested groups* checkbox, when checked, allows nested groups to be traversed by the search.
+
*Test Groups Query* permits a composed query to be tested for a specific user.
Left-click to open:
+
[#configure-ldap-test-groups-query]
image::manage-security/testGroupsQuery.png[,340,align=left]
+
To perform the search, add a username, and left-click on the *Test Groups Query* button.
Notifications confirming success or failure appear on the dialog.

* *Advanced Settings*.
Left-click to open:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-advanced-settings]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogAdvancedSettings.png[,440,align=left]
+
The advanced settings are as follows:

** *Request timeout ms*.
The number of milliseconds to elapse before a query times out.
The default is 4000.

** *Max Parallel Connections*.
The maximum number of parallel connections to the LDAP server that can be maintained.
The default is 1000.

** *Max Cache Records*.
The maximum number of requests that can be cached.
The default is 10000.

** *Cache Time-to-Live ms*
Lifetime of values in cache in milliseconds.
The default is 300000.

** *Group Max Nesting Depth*
The maximum number of recursive group-queries the server is allowed to perform.
This option is only valid when nested groups are enabled.
The value must be an integer between 1 and 100.
The default is 10.

When all required data has been entered, left-click on the *Save LDAP Configuration* button, at the bottom right:

[#configure-ldap-dialog-save-button]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPdialogSaveButton.png[,260,align=left]

Alternatively, left-click on *Cancel* to abandon the configuration procedure.

[#create-couchbase-server-group]
=== Create a Couchbase-Server Group

To create a Couchbase-Server _group_, and map it to an _LDAP group_, left-click on the *Groups* tab, at the upper right of the *Users* panel, on the *Security* screen:

[#access-groups-tab]
image::manage-security/accessGroupsTab.png[,160,align=left]

This brings up the *User Groups* screen, which initially appears as follows:

[#groups-screen-initial]
image::manage-security/groupsScreenInitial.png[,700,align=left]

The screen in blank, because no groups have yet been defined.
To create a group, left-click on the *ADD GROUP* tab, at the upper right:

[#add-group-tab]
image::manage-security/addGroupTab.png[,90,align=left]

This brings up the *Add New Group* dialog:

[#add-new-group-dialog]
image::manage-security/addNewGroupDialog.png[,360,align=left]

The fields are as follows:

* *Group Name*.
The name of the new Couchbase-Server group to be created.

* *Description*.
An optional description of the new Couchbase-Servergroup.

* *Map to LDAP Group*.
The name of the existing LDAP group to which the new Couchbase-Server group is to be mapped.
When a user authenticates by means of LDAP, a list of the LDAP groups to which they are assigned on that server is returned to Couchbase Server: if this list contains the LDAP group specified here, the user inherits the roles associated with the new Couchbase-Server group.

* *Roles*. The roles to be associated with the new Couchbase-Server group.
For information, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

With appropriate data added, the dialog might appear as follows:

[#add-new-group-dialog-complete]
image::manage-security/addNewGroupDialogComplete.png[,360,align=left]

To save the group, left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower right.

[#add-new-group-save-button]
image::manage-security/addNewGroupSaveButton.png[,120,align=left]

Alternatively, left-click on *Cancel* to abandon group configuration.

Once the group has been saved, the *User Groups* screen is displayed with the new group visible:

[#groups-screen-complete]
image::manage-security/groupsScreenComplete.png[,600,align=left]

[#configure-ldap-with-the-cli]
== Configure LDAP with the CLI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-ldap \
--cluster http://10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--authentication-enabled 1 \
--authorization-enabled 1 \
--hosts 172.23.124.25 --port 389 \
--disable-cert-validation \
--encryption none \
--query-dn domain=LOCAL \
--query-pass querypassword \
--group-query %D?memberOf?base
----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, and specifies `--authorization-enabled` and `--authentication-enabled` for the user-credentials that will be passed from Couchbase Server.
The argument specified for `--group-query` is the query that retrieves the LDAP groups of which the user is a member.

If successful, the call produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: LDAP settings modified
----

For more information, see the command reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap].

[#reference-ldap-groups-with-cli]
=== Reference LDAP Groups with the CLI

Both Couchbase Server and LDAP support _groups_.
Each group's privileges are shared by the group's members.
If LDAP communication has been configured to retrieve users' LDAP groups, these can be associated with existing Couchbase-Server groups and group-associated roles.
This is handled by means of the xref:cli:cbcli/user-manage.adoc[user-manage] command.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli user-manage -c 10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--set-group \
--group-name admins \
--roles admin \
--group-description "Couchbase Server Administrators" \
--ldap-ref domain=admins
----

This establishes a Couchbase Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It additionally references the LDAP group `admins`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated external users who are in the LDAP 'admins' group are placed in the Couchbase Server 'admins' group, and thereby are granted the 'admin' role.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api]
== Configure LDAP with the REST API

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a source of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the `pools` endpoint, as follows:

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools \
-d authentication_enabled=true \
-d authorization_enabled=true \
-d hosts=172.23.124.25 \
-d port=389 \
-d encryption=TLS \
-d max_parallel_connections=100 \
-d server_cert_validation=false \
-d max_cache_size=10000 \
-d request_timeout=5000 \
-d nested_groups_enabled=false \
-d nested_groups_max_depth=10 \
-d cache_value_lifetime=300000 \
-d groups_query %D?memberOf?base \
-d query_dn='domain=LOCAL' \
-d query_pass=querypassword
----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, enabling authorization and authentication for user-credentials to be passed from Couchbase Server.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

[#reference-ldap-groups-with-the-rest-api]
=== Reference LDAP Groups with the REST API

----
curl -v -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/rbac/groups/admins \
-d roles=admin \
-d description=Couchbase+Server+Administrators \
-d ldap_group_ref=domain%3Dadmins
----

This establishes a Couchbase Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It additionally references the LDAP group `admins`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated external users who are in the LDAP 'admins' group are placed in the Couchbase Server 'admins' group, and thereby are granted the 'admin' role.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc[Role Based Admin Access (RBAC)].
