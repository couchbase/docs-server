= Configure LDAP

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be configured to authenticate the external user by means of LDAP; and to map the LDAP _groups_ of which the user is a member to roles defined on Couchbase Server.

[#understanding-ldap-authentication]
== Understanding LDAP Authentication and Authorization

For authentication purposes, Couchbase Server can be configured to use LDAP.
This allows users, when they attempt to access Couchbase Server by presenting their credentials, to be authenticated by LDAP.
Optionally, LDAP _group_ information for the authenticated user can be fetched from the LDAP server.
Each LDAP group can be mapped to a Couchbase-Server group, whose assigned roles are thereby granted to the user.

Note that Couchbase Server provides two different ways of setting up LDAP:

* _Native LDAP Support_.
For Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5+, this is the recommended way of setting up LDAP for external authentication.
It provides support for encrypted communication, and for LDAP groups.

* _LDAP Support Based on_ `saslauthd`.
This is maintained for support of legacy LDAP authentication (as established on pre-6.5 versions of Couchbase Server), and for support of PAM-based authentication.

This page provides examples of how to configure _Native LDAP Support_.
For information on configuring `saslauthd`, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure `saslauthd`].
For an overview of Couchbase authentication, and more details on external authentication options, see xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication].

Note that _either_ Native LDAP Support _or_ `saslauthd` must be selected for the cluster.
The two cannot be used simultaneously.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-addition]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to configure Native LDAP Support; using the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* A one-node cluster already exists; and is named after its IP address: `10.143.192.101`.
It is running the Data and Query Services, and has the `travel-sample` bucket installed.
(To install this bucket, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].)

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Two fully configured LDAP servers are available, at `172.23.124.25` and `172.23.124.26`, each using port `389`.

Each example also shows how to map LDAP groups to Couchbase-Server user-groups.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-ui]
== Configure LDAP with the UI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, access the *Security* panel, by means of the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#security-tab]
image::manage-security/securityTab.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *Security* screen.
Note the options at the upper right:

[#ldap-and-groups-tabs]
image::manage-security/ldapAndGroupsTabs.png[,200,align=left]

The *LDAP* tab allows an LDAP server to be specified for external authentication.
The *Groups* tab allows definition of _Couchbase-Server user-groups_, which are to be associated with _LDAP groups_, and which can be assigned Couchbase-Server _roles_.
The *ADD USER* tab allows individual users to be added, and for their authentication to be specified as *external*; allowing their LDAP group-membership to be mapped to one or more Couchbase-Server user-groups and their assigned roles.

[#configure-an-ldap-server-with-the-ui]
=== Configure an LDAP Server with the UI

To configure an LDAP server with the UI, left-click on the *LDAP* tab, at the upper right of the *Security* screen:

[#left-click-on-ldap-tab]
image::manage-security/leftClickOnLdapTab.png[,70,align=left]

This brings up the *LDAP Configuration* dialog:

[#configure-ldap-dialog]
image::manage-security/configureLDAP.png[,420,align=left]

The dialog presents two main panels.
The left panel features options whereby LDAP can be configured.
The right panel features help text, for *LDAP Host Configuration*, *User Authentication*, and *Group Authorization*.

Initially, the left panel displays the following fields:

* *LDAP Host(s)*. A comma-separated list of host-names, each of which is an LDAP server on which external authentication can occur.
The first accessible server in the list is the one that is used.
For example, if the list is `server1, server2`, provided that `server1` is accessible, it is used.)

* *LDAP Port*. The port used on each of the LDAP servers for authentication.

* *Encryption*. Whether the connection with the LDAP server or servers should be encrypted.
Note that use of encryption is _strongly_ recommended.
+
Left-click on the control at the right-hand side of the *Encryption* field, to display the pull-down menu:
+
[#encryption-pull-down-menu]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPencryptionPullDownMenu.png[,200,align=left]
+
The options are *None* (to connect without encryption &#8212; this is insecure, and therefore is _not_ recommended), *TLS* (to connect to a TLS-encrypted port), and *StartTLSExtension* (to upgrade an existing connection).

* *Certificate Validation*. Whether to validate Couchbase Server with the server certificate.
This set of radio-buttons is enabled only if *TLS* or *StartTLSExtension* has been selected from the *Encryption* pull-down menu.
+
The options are *None*, *Couchbase*, and *Paste Cert*.
If *None* is selected, no certificate validation occurs: this option is insecure, and therefore _not_ recommended.
+
If *Couchbase* is selected, the certificate already installed for the cluster is used for validation.
(See xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates] for information.)
If *Paste Cert* is selected, the panel expands vertically, to reveal the *Certificate Text* field:
+
[#certificate-text-field]
image::manage-security/certificateTextField.png[,400,align=left]
+
The text of the appropriate certificate should be copied and pasted, in PEM format, into the *Certificate Text* field.

* *Contact LDAP host anonymously*.
Checking this checkbox causes Couchbase Server to attempt to contact the LDAP host anonymously.
However, the attempt succeeds only if supported by the LDAP configuration.

* *LDAP DN*.
The LDAP _distinguished name_ of the user to perform user-search and groups synchronization.
This user needs to have _read only_ access to the LDAP server, in order to be able to search for users and groups.

* *Password*.
The password for the user specified in the *LDAP DN* field.

At this point, with data entered, the dialog might appear as follows:

[#configure-ldap-dialog-half-complete]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPhalfComplete.png[,520,align=left]


Optionally, the *Check Network Settings* button can now be left-clicked on.
This tests whether the specified LDAP hosts are accessible across the network.
If none of the servers is accessible, an error is displayed on the dialog.

The dialog provides the following additional controls, for editing and deleting the group:

* *Enable LDAP user authentication*.
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#configure-ldap-dialog-enable-ldap-user-auth-field]
image::manage-security/configureLdapEnableLdapUserAuthField.png[,400,align=left]
+
This provides three options whereby usernames can be mapped to LDAP distinguished names (https://ldap.com/ldap-dns-and-rdns/[DN^]).
The default option is *Template*.
An appropriate mapping should be entered into the *Template* editable text field: this avoids the need to request the LDAP server to provide the username-to-DN mapping.
The required format is indicated by the placeholder text, within the field.
The `%u` is replaced by the username used at login.
+
For example, based on the placeholder, if the user logs in as `exampleUser`, the user is mapped to the DN `cn=exampleUser,dc=example,dc=com`.
+
Each of the other options, *LDAP query* and *Custom*, likewise provides a vertical expansion of the dialog, to accommodate entry of an appropriate mapping-procedure.
Selecting *LDAP query* displays the following:
+
image::manage-security/ldapQuery.png[,400,align=left]
+
Couchbase server performs the specified LDAP https://ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation/[search operation] to get the user's DN from LDAP server.
*Base* is the search base https://ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation/[DN]
*Filter* is the https://ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation/[search filter].
Search scope is always `one`; and `%u` is replaced with the username that was used by the current administrator to log into Couchbase Web Console.
For example, if *Base* is specified as `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com`, *Filter* as `(uid=%u)`, and the username is `exampleUser`, Couchbase Server performs the following search, in order to obtain the user's DN: `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com??one?(uid=exampleUser)`.
+
Selecting *Custom* displays the following;
+
image::manage-security/custom.png[,400,align=left]
+
This option allows a custom rule-set to be provided.
The rules are used for mapping usernames to LDAP DNs, and must be expressed using the following JSON format:
+
image::manage-security/jsonSearchSyntax.png[,400,align=left]
+
The rules thus expressed sequentially in the array are applied one by one, until one of the regular expressions matches.
When a match is achieved, the specified query or template is used to retrieve the user's DN.
+
If no match is found, the assumes the username employed by the administrator at Couchbase-Server login to be the DN (in other words, the administrator logged in with a username such as `cn=exampleUser,dc=example,dc=com`.
+
For example, a rule-set might be expressed as follows:
+
----
[
  {
    "re":"(.+)@(.+).com",
    "query":"ou=users, dc={1},dc=com??one?(uid={0})"
  },
  {
    "re":"(.+)",
    "template":"cn={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  }
]
----
+
If the username `myuser@test.com` is specified, a match is made on the regular expression provided by the first rule in the array: therefore the query `ou=users, dc=test,dc=com??one?(uid=myuser)` is used to retrieve the DN.
+
If the username `myuser` is specified, a match is made on the regular expression provided by the second rule: therefore, the template `cn&#61;&#x007B;0&#x007D;,ou&#61;users,dc&#61;example,dc&#61;com` is used to retrieve the DN.
+
*Test User Authentication*, when opened, provides options for testing the authentication of specific users:
+
[#test-user-auth-field]
image::manage-security/testUserAuth.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the username and password for the user, and left-click on *Test User Authentication*.
Notifications confirming success or failure duly appear on the dialog.

[#enable-ldap-group-authorization]
* *Enable LDAP group authorization & sync*.
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#configure-dialog-test-groups-query]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPgroupsPanel.png[,400,align=left]
+
The LDAP groups of which a user is a member can be searched for by means of either the *User's attributes* or an *LDAP Query*, each of which is provided as a radio-button option.
Selection of each reveals a corresponding set of fields, in which information can be added:

** *User's attributes*.
Selected by default, this instructs Couchbase Server to assume that each LDAP user-record contains an attribute featuring the list of groups of which the user is a member.
Couchbase Server therefore performs the following LDAP search: `<userDN>?<attribute>?one`.
+
The value of the specified `attribute` is treated as a list of groups.
For example, if `attribute` is set to `memberOf`,
Couchbase Server perform the following search for the specified user's groups:
`uid=exampleUser,dc=example,dc=com?memberOf?one`.

** *LDAP Query*.
When this is selected, the *Query for Groups Using* panel appears as follows:
+
image::manage-security/ldapConfigurationLDAPquery.png[,400,align=left]
+
Selection of *LDAP Query* instructs Couchbase Server to perform an LDAP search, in order to retrieve a list of the user's groups.
For explanations of *Base*, *Filter*, *Scope*, see https://ldap.com/the-ldap-search-operation/[The LDAP Search Operation^].
When the search is conducted, `%u` is replaced with the specified username; and
`%D` is replaced with user's DN.
+
For example, *Base* might be specified as `ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`, *Filter* as `(member=%D)`, and *Scope* as `one`:
+
image::manage-security/ldapQueryDetail.png[,320,align=left]

** The *Traverse nested groups* checkbox, when checked, allows nested groups to be traversed by the search.
If nested search is selected, `%u` cannot be used.
+
Note that use of nested groups may significantly increase load on the LDAP server; and should therefore only be used when necessary.

** *Test Groups Query* permits an LDAP query to be tested for a specific user.
Left-click to open:
+
[#configure-ldap-test-groups-query]
image::manage-security/testGroupsQuery.png[,340,align=left]
+
To perform the search, add a username, and left-click on the *Test Groups Query* button.
Notifications confirming success or failure appear on the dialog.

* *Advanced Settings*.
It is strongly recommended that these _not_ be changed; except in unusual circumstances, and in accordance with expert advice.
Inappropriate settings may seriously impair system responsiveness.
+
Left-click to open:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-advanced-settings]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogAdvancedSettings.png[,440,align=left]
+
The advanced settings are as follows:

** *Request timeout ms*.
The number of milliseconds to elapse before a query times out.
The default is 5000.

** *Max Parallel Connections*.
The maximum number of parallel connections to the LDAP server that can be maintained.
The default is 100.

** *Max Cache Records*.
The maximum number of requests that can be cached.
The default is 10000.

** *Cache Time-to-Live ms*.
The lifetime of values in cache, in milliseconds.
The default is 300000.

** *Group Max Nesting Depth*.
The maximum number of recursive group-queries that the server is allowed to perform.
This option is only valid when nested groups are enabled.
The value must be an integer between 1 and 100: the default is 10.

When all required data has been entered, left-click on the *Save LDAP Configuration* button, at the bottom right:

[#configure-ldap-dialog-save-button]
image::manage-security/configureLDAPdialogSaveButton.png[,260,align=left]

Alternatively, left-click on *Cancel* to abandon the configuration procedure.

[#map-ldap-groups-to-couchbase-server-roles]
=== Map LDAP Groups to Couchbase-Server Roles

To map an LDAP group to a Couchbase-Server role, you must first create a Couchbase-Server user-group; then associate this user-group with an LDAP group; and finally, assign roles.

Left-click on the *Groups* tab, at the upper right of the *Users* panel, on the *Security* screen:

[#access-groups-tab]
image::manage-security/accessGroupsTab.png[,160,align=left]

This brings up the *User Groups* screen, which initially appears as follows:

[#groups-screen-initial]
image::manage-security/groupsScreenInitial.png[,700,align=left]

The screen is blank, because no groups have yet been defined.
To create a group, left-click on the *ADD GROUP* tab, at the upper right:

[#add-group-tab]
image::manage-security/addGroupTab.png[,90,align=left]

This brings up the *Add New Group* dialog:

[#add-new-group-dialog]
image::manage-security/addNewGroupDialog.png[,420,align=left]

The fields are as follows:

* *Group Name*.
The name of the new Couchbase-Server group to be created.

* *Description*.
An optional description of the new Couchbase-Server group.

* *Map to LDAP Group*.
The name of the existing LDAP group to which the new Couchbase-Server group is to be mapped.
When a user authenticates by means of LDAP, and LDAP group authorization has been enabled (by means of the *Enable LDAP group authorization & sync* control, described xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#enable-ldap-group-authorization[above]), a list of the LDAP groups to which the user is assigned on that server is returned to Couchbase Server: if this list contains the LDAP group specified here, the user inherits the roles associated with the new Couchbase-Server group.

* *Roles*. The roles to be associated with the new Couchbase-Server group.
For information, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

[#add-new-group-dialog-complete]
With appropriate data added, the dialog might appear as follows:

image::manage-security/addNewGroupDialogComplete.png[,420,align=left]

This creates a group named `Admins`, and assigns the `Full Admin` role to it, specifying as its LDAP-group mapping `uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`.

[#add-new-group-save-button]
To save the group, left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower right.

image::manage-security/addNewGroupSaveButton.png[,120,align=left]

Alternatively, left-click on *Cancel* to abandon group configuration.

[#editing-a-group-mapping]
=== Editing a Group Mapping

Once a group-mapping has been defined, it can be edited.

Access the *Users & Groups* panel of the *Security* screen.
By default, this presents a _users_ view, listing the currently defined users for the cluster.
To display the _groups_ view, left-click on the *Groups* tab, towards the upper right:

image::manage-security/usersAndGroupsSelectGroups.png[,120,align=middle]

This brings up the _groups_ view, which shows currently defined user-groups for the cluster.

image::manage-security/usersAndGroupsGroupsView.png[,800,align=middle]

This confirms the existence of the user-group `Admins`.

Now, left-click on the row displayed for this group.
The row expands vertically, and exposes additional controls:

image::manage-security/expandedGroupRow.png[,800,align=middle]

Left-click on the *Edit* button, at the lower right:

image::manage-security/editGroupRowButton.png[,180,align=middle]

This brings up the *Edit Group Admins* dialog:

image::manage-security/editGroupAdmins.png[,420,align=middle]

Within this dialog, the description, mapping, or roles for the group can be edited.
For details of selecting roles within the *Roles* panel, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].


[#adding-an-externally-authenticated-user]
=== Adding an Externally Authenticated User

Couchbase-Server users can be specified as _externally authenticated_, when they are added to the system.
If an LDAP group-mapping has been defined, externally authenticated users can also be recognized as members of one or more corresponding Couchbase-Server user-groups, and thereby assigned the appropriate privileges.

Step-by-step instructions on adding externally authenticated users are provided in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc#adding-an-externally-authenticated-user[Manage Users and Groups].

[#configure-ldap-with-the-cli]
== Configure LDAP with the CLI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-ldap \
--cluster http://10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--hosts 172.23.124.25 --port 389 \
--encryption startTLS \
--ca-cert '/path/to/cert' \
--query-dn 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com' \
--query-pass 'password' \
--authentication-enabled 1 \
--user-dn-mapping '[{"re":"(.+)","template":"uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"}]' \
--authorization-enabled 1 \
--group-query 'ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com??one?(member=%D)'
----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, and specifies `--authorization-enabled` and `--authentication-enabled` for the user-credentials that will be passed from Couchbase Server.
The argument specified for `--group-query` is the query that retrieves the LDAP groups of which the user is a member.
A `--user-dn-mapping` is specified.

If successful, the call produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: LDAP settings modified
----

For more information, see the command reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap].

[#map-groups-with-the-cli]
=== Map Groups with the CLI

The xref:cli:cbcli/user-manage.adoc[user-manage] command allows users and groups to be created and deleted, and roles to be assigned.

For example, a Couchbase-Server user-group can be defined as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli user-manage -c 10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--set-group \
--group-name admins \
--roles admin \
--group-description "Couchbase Server Administrators" \
--ldap-ref 'uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com'
----

This establishes a Couchbase-Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It references the LDAP group `uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated external users who are in the LDAP group `uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com` are placed in the Couchbase-Server 'admins' group, and thereby are granted the 'admin' role.

A group can be deleted by means of the `--delete-group` flag:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli user-manage --cluster http://10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--delete-group  \
--group-name admins
----

If successful, the command returns the following message:

----
SUCCESS: Group 'admins' was deleted
----

For examples of using the `user-manage` command to create LDAP-authenticated users, and optionally assign them to groups, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc#manage-external-users[Manage External Users].

[#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api]
== Configure LDAP with the REST API

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a source of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the `/settings/ldap` endpoint, as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/ldap \
-d hosts=172.23.124.25 \
-d port=389 \
-d encryption=StartTLSExtension \
-d server_cert_validation=true \
--data-urlencode cacert@/path/to/cert \
-d query_dn='cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com' \
-d query_pass=password \
-d authentication_enabled=true \
--data-urlencode user_dn_mapping='[{"re":"(.+)","template":"uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"}]' \
-d authorization_enabled=true \
--data-urlencode groups_query='ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com??one?(member=%D)'

----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, enabling authorization and authentication for user-credentials to be passed from Couchbase Server.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

[#map-groups-with-the-rest-api]
=== Map Groups with the REST API

Use the `PUT /settings/rbac/groups/admins` method and URI, as follows:

----
curl -v -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/rbac/groups/admins \
-d roles=admin \
-d description=Couchbase+Server+Adminirators \
--data-urlencode ldap_group_ref='uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com'
----

This establishes a Couchbase Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It maps the `admins` group to the LDAP group `uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated external users who are in the LDAP `uid=cbadmins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com` group are placed in the Couchbase Server `admins` group, and thereby are granted the `admin` role.

For more information on using the REST API to manage roles, see xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc[Role Based Admin Access (RBAC)].
