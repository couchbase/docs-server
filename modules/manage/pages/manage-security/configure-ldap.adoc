= Configure LDAP

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be configured to authenticate the user by means of an LDAP server; and to recognize the LDAP _groups_ of which the user is a member.

[#understanding-ldap-authentication]
== Understanding LDAP Authentication.

For authentication purposes, Couchbase Server can be configured to exchange information with an LDAP server.
This allows the user, when they attempt to access Couchbase Server by presenting their credentials, to be authenticated on the LDAP server.
It also allows _LDAP group_ information for the authenticated user to be retrieved from the LDAP server, and duly mapped to groups and group-based roles defined on Couchbase Server.

This page provides examples of how to configure Couchbase Server to work with an LDAP server.
For an overview of Couchbase authentication, see xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication].

[#examples-on-this-page-node-addition]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to configure LDAP; using the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* A one-node cluster already exists; and is named after its IP address: `10.143.192.101`.
It is running the Data and Query services, and has the `travel-sample` bucket installed.
(To access and install this, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].)

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* A fully configured LDAP server is available at `172.23.124.25`, port `389`.

Each example also shows how to _associate_ Couchbase Server groups with LDAP groups: once LDAP communication has been configured to retrieve users' LDAP groups, these can be _associated_ with existing Couchbase-Server groups.
Consequently, the user who has membership to one or more LDAP-defined groups, and who is successfully authenticated for access to Couchbase Server via LDAP, inherits the Couchbase-Server roles provided by the associated Couchbase-Server groups.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-ui]
== Configure LDAP with the UI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, access the *Security* panel, by means of the tab in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#security-tab]
image::manage-security/securityTab.png[,60,align=left]

This brings up the *Security* screen.
Note the options at the upper right:

[#ldap-and-groups-tabs]
image::manage-security/ldapAndGroupsTabs.png[,200,align=left]

The *LDAP* tab allows configuration of an LDAP server, for external authentication.
The *Groups* tab allows definition of _Couchbase-Server groups_, which are associated with _LDAP groups_, and which can be assigned Couchbase-Server _roles_.
The *ADD USER* tab allows individual users to be added, and for their authentication to be specified as *external*; allowing their LDAP group-membership to be recognized, and duly associated with one or more Couchbase-Server groups and their assigned roles.

[#configure-an-ldap-server-with-the-ui]
=== Configure an LDAP Server with the UI

To configure an LDAP server with the UI, left-click on the *LDAP* tab, at the upper right of the *Security* screen:

[#left-click-on-ldap-tab]
image::manage-security/leftClickOnLdapTab.png[,70,align=left]

This brings up the *Add LDAP* dialog:

[#add-ldap-dialog]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialog.png[,400,align=left]

The dialog presents the following initial fields:

* *LDAP Hosts*. A comma-separated list of host-names, each of which is an LDAP server on which external authentication is to occur.

* *LDAP port*. The port used on each of the LDAP servers for authentication.

* *Encryption*. Whether the connection with the LDAP server or servers should be encrypted. The options are *None*, *TLS* (to connect to a TLS-encrypted port), and *StartTLSExtension* (to upgrade an existing connection).

* *Certificate Validation*. Whether to validate Couchbase Server with the server certificate.
If *none* is selected, no such validation occurs.
If *Use server cert* is selected, the panel expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#certificate-validation-panel]
image::manage-security/certificateValidationPanel.png[,400,align=left]
+
The text of the certificate, which can be obtained from the *Security* screen's *Root Certificate* tab, should be copied and pasted into the editable field provided.

* *User DN*. The domain name for groups synchronization.

* *Password*. The password for groups synchronization.

When data has been entered, the dialog may appear as follows:

[#add-ldap-dialog-half-complete]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogHalfComplete.png[,380,align=left]

At this point, the *Check Network Settings* button can optionally be left-clicked on.
The tests whether the specified LDAP hosts are accessible across the network.
If one or more servers is not accessible, the following error is displayed on the dialog:

[#add-ldap-dialog-cannot-access-server]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogCannotAccessServer.png[,280,align=left]

The dialog provides the following additional fields:

* *Enable LDAP user authentication*.
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-enable-ldap-user-auth-template]
image::manage-security/addLdapEnableLdapUserAuthTemplate.png[,380,align=left]
+
This provides three options whereby usernames can be mapped, on the LDAP server.
The default option is *Template*.
An appropriate template should be entered into the *Template* editable text field.
+
Each of the other options, *LDAP query builder* and *Custom*, likewise provides a vertical expansion of the dialog, to accommodate entry of an appropriate mapping-procedure.

* *Enable LDAP group authorization & sync*
Switch on, to enable.
This expands the dialog vertically, as follows:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-enable-group-auth]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogEnableGroupAuth.png[,380,align=left]
+
This provides three options whereby the LDAP groups to which an authenticated user is assigned can be queried for, on the LDAP server.
It also provides a checkbox, for enabling queries to traverse nested groups.
The default option is *User's attributes*.
Appropriate attributes should be entered into the *User Attributes* editable text field.
+
Each of the other options, *LDAP query builder* and *Custom*, likewise provides a vertical expansion of the dialog, to accommodate entry of an appropriate query model.

* *Test Groups Query*.
Permits a composed query to be tested.
Left-click to open:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-test-groups-query]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogTestGroupsQuery.png[,380,align=left]
+
Enter the name of a user to be authenticated in the editable text field, and left-click on the *Test Groups Query* button.
Output is displayed on the dialog, below the button.

* *Advanced Settings*.
Left-click to open:
+
[#add-ldap-dialog-advanced-settings]
image::manage-security/addLdapDialogAdvancedSettings.png[,380,align=left]
+
The advanced settings are as follows:

** *Request timeout ms*.
The number of milliseconds to elapse before a query times out.
The default is 4000.

** *Max Parallel Connections*.
The maximum number of parallel connections to the LDAP server that can be maintained.
The default is 1000.

** *Max Cache Records*.
The maximum number of requests that can be cached.
The default is 10000.

** *Cache Time-to-Live ms*
Lifetime of values in cache in milliseconds. 
The default is 300000.

** *Group Max Nesting Depth*
The maximum number of recursive group-queries the server is allowed to perform.
This option is only valid when nested groups are enabled.
The value must be an integer between 1 and 100.
The default is 10.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-cli]
== Configure LDAP with the CLI

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a point of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-ldap \
--cluster http://10.143.192.101 --username Administrator \
--password password --authentication-enabled 1 \
--authorization-enabled 1 --hosts 172.23.124.25 --port 389 \
--disable-cert-validation --encryption none \
--query-dn domain=LOCAL --query-pass querypassword \
--group-query %D?memberOf?base
----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, and specifies `--authorization-enabled` and `--authentication-enabled` for the user-credentials that will be passed from Couchbase Server.
The `--group-query` retrieves the LDAP groups of which the user is a member.

If successful, the call produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: LDAP settings modified
----

For more information, see the command reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap].

[#reference-ldap-groups-with-cli]
=== Reference LDAP Groups with the CLI

Both Couchbase Server and LDAP support _groups_.
Each group's privileges are shared by the group's members.
If LDAP communication has been configured to retrieve users' LDAP groups, these can be associated with existing Couchbase-Server groups and group-associated roles.
This is handled by means of the xref:cli:cbcli/user-manage.adoc[user-manage] command.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli user-manage -c 10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator --password password \
--set-group --group-name admins --roles admin \
--group-description "Couchbase Server Administrators" \
--ldap-ref domain=admins
----

This establishes a Couchbase Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It additionally references the LDAP group `admins`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated Couchbase Server users who are in the LDAP 'admins' group are placed in the Couchbase Server 'admins' group, and thereby are granted the 'admin' role.

[#configure-ldap-with-the-rest-api]
== Configure LDAP with the REST API

To configure an LDAP server to be used as a source of authentication for Couchbase Server, use the `pools` endpoint, as follows:

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools \
-d authentication_enabled=true \
-d authorization_enabled=true \
-d hosts=172.23.124.25 \
-d port=389 \
-d encryption=TLS \
-d max_parallel_connections=100 \
-d server_cert_validation=false \
-d max_cache_size=10000 \
-d request_timeout=5000 \
-d nested_groups_enabled=false \
-d nested_groups_max_depth=10 \
-d cache_value_lifetime=300000 \
-d groups_query %D?memberOf?base \
-d query_dn='domain=LOCAL' \
-d query_pass=querypassword
----

This call references the LDAP server at `172.23.125.25`, on port `389`, enabling authorization and authentication for user-credentials to be passed from Couchbase Server.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

[#reference-ldap-groups-with-the-rest-api]
=== Reference LDAP Groups with the REST API

----
curl -v -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/rbac/groups/admins \
-d roles=admin \
-d description=Couchbase+Server+Administrators \
-d ldap_group_ref=domain%3Dadmins
----

This establishes a Couchbase Server group named `admins`, each of whose members is granted the `admin` (the `Full Administrator`) role.
It additionally references the LDAP group `admins`: from this point, LDAP-authenticated Couchbase Server users who are in the LDAP 'admins' group are placed in the Couchbase Server 'admins' group, and thereby are granted the 'admin' role.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc[Role Based Admin Access (RBAC)].
