= Configure PAM
:page-aliases: security:security-pam-auth

[abstract]
_Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) provide an authentication framework that allows multiple, low-level authentication schemes to be used by a single API.
The _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, running on Linux, supports administrator-authentication through PAM's _Linux password-module_.

== PAM Features

Used with the _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, the PAM _Linux password-module_ provides:

* _External authentication_: Administrator-accounts defined on Linux systems, in the `/etc/shadow` directory, can be accessed for authentication-purposes by Couchbase Server.

* _Password policy-management_: Linux password-management can be used across different Couchbase Server-nodes; to synchronize, maintain, and expire administrator-passwords.

== Version Requirements

Use of the PAM Linux password-module requires all cluster-nodes to be Linux-based, running the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, version 4.6 or above.
Additionally, the `saslauthd` library version must be 2.1.x or above.

== Set Up Linux-Password Authentication

The following sequence shows how the PAM Linux password-module can be used to validate usernames and passwords, when administrators log into Couchbase Server.
Supervisor access, via `sudo`, is required to perform most of the steps; and an editor is required, to allow you to edit configuration files.

Note that for PAM to be fully configured, the following procedure must be performed _on each node in the cluster_.

Proceed as follows:

. Bring up a terminal, and install the `saslauthd` library for your Linux distribution:

** *Centos/RHEL*
+
[source,bash]
----
yum install cyrus-sasl
----

** *Ubuntu/Debian*
+
[source,bash]
----
apt-get install sasl2-bin
----

. Ensure that the Couchbase Cluster is running.
Then, enable external authentication on the cluster, using the Couchbase CLI `setting-ldap` command: specifying server IP-address and port number, username, and password:
+
[source,bash]
----
 couchbase-cli setting-saslauthd -c 10.142.170.101:8091 \
 -u Administrator -p password --enabled 1
----
+
Note that `--enabled 1` enables external authentication, and `--enabled 0` disables.
See xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-saslauthd.adoc[setting-saslauthd] for further information.
When successfully executed, the command provides the following notification: `SUCCESS: saslauthd settings modified`.

. Add the `couchbase` user to the `sasl` group, to allow access to `saslauthd`:
+
[source,bash]
----
usermod -aG sasl couchbase
----

. In the `saslauthd` configuration file, verify that `saslauthd` is set up to use PAM, by using the `grep` command, and examining the output, using one of the following procedures:

** *Centos/RHEL*
+
[source,bash]
----
grep "MECH" /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd
MECH=pam
----
+
If output to the above command does not confirm that `MECH` is set to `pam`, bring up the configuration file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and manually set the `MECH` parameter to `pam`.
+
** *Ubuntu/Debian*
+
[source,bash]
----
grep 'MECHANISMS' /etc/default/saslauthd
MECHANISMS="pam"
----
+
If output to the above command does not confirm that `MECHANISMS` is set to `pam`, bring up the configuration file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and manually set the `MECHANISMS` parameter to `pam`.

. Set up PAM to authenticate the Couchbase service, by copying `/etc/pam.d/passwd` to `/etc/pam.d/couchbase`.
+
[source,bash]
----
cp /etc/pam.d/passwd /etc/pam.d/couchbase
----

. Create a Linux user on the current system, and give them a password.
For example, use the username [.in]`linuxuser`
(this user is the administrator who will be authenticated by PAM).
Enter the following commands, to create the user and to commence definition of their password, respectively:
+
[source,bash]
----
useradd linuxuser
passwd linuxuser
----
+
The `passwd` command returns the prompt `Enter new UNIX password:`.
Duly enter and then verify your chosen password.

. Access Couchbase Web Console (if on the same node, at `localhost:8091`), and log in.
Then, access the [.ui]*Security* tab,  on the upper, horizontal control-bar.
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* view:
+
[#security_view_initial]
image::manage-security/securityViewInitial.png[,820]

. Left-click on the *ADD USER* button, situated near the right.
This brings up the [.ui]*Add New User* dialog.
Select the [.ui]*External* radio-button, in the [.ui]*Authentication Domain* panel at the upper left.
Then, enter the name of the new user you are creating.
(Note that at this point, if xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc[Native LDAP] has also been configured for the cluster, the notification `not found` appears above the username-field: however, this can be ignored.)
Next, specify a suitable role, such as [.ui]*Cluster Admin*.
+
The panel now appears as follows:
+
[#manage_user_new_subsequent2]
image::manage-security/manageUserNewSubsequent2.png[,380]
+
Then, left-click on [.ui]*Save*.
The newly defined user now appears in the [.ui]*Security* view.
+
image::manage-security/linuxUser.png[,820]

. In the terminal, restart the SASL service, to allow PAM authentication to take effect.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service saslauthd restart
----
+
When this command is successful, the output confirms that the daemon has been started.
If the command fails, bring up the file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and locate the line that contains the `START` variable.
If this line reads `START=no`, change it to `START=yes`.
Then, save the file, exit, and rerun the command.

. Restart the Couchbase-Server service, to allow external authentication through PAM to take effect.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service couchbase-server restart
----

. In the browser, on the same node, access `localhost:8091`.
When the Couchbase Web Console login-interface appears, enter the username and password you previously created:
+
[#couchbase_login]
image::manage-security/couchbaseLogin.png[,360]
+
Left-click on the *Sign In* button.
The user you created is now logged into Couchbase Server, as an administrator.

[#troubleshooting]
== Troubleshooting

If login does not succeed, bring up the file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and ensure it contains the line `START=yes`.
If the line reads `START=no`, change it to `START=yes`.
Also confirm that the `MECH` (for RedHat/Centos) or `MECHANISM` (for Ubuntu/Debian) parameter is set to `pam`.
Save the file, and exit.
Then, restart both `saslauthd` and `couchbase-server`, as described above.
Finally, re-attempt login.
