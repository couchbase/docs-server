= Configure Server Certificates

[abstract]
Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition supports X.509 certificates, for
the encryption of communications between the server and
networked clients.

[#certificate-management-preparation]
== Certificate-Management Preparation

Before configuring certificates for Couchbase Server, see the
conceptual and architectural information provided in
xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].
Additionally,
perform the following assessments:

* _Where should the configured CA, intermediate, and node keys reside?_ The
procedure below generates all keys and certificates in a directory named
`SSLCA`, which you can put anywhere on your filesystem.
+
The generated private node key (`pkey.key`) and chain certificate (`chain.pem`)
must be posted in a specific place that is in the certificate trust path
(such as [.path]_/Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/_
on MacOSX, or [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/_) on Linux.

* _Does your cluster contain one node only, or multiple nodes?_ With one node,
you will generate one node directory inside the directory SSLCA that will
contain the private node key (`pkey.key`) and the certificate chain file
(`chain.pem`). The node public key (`pkey.pem`) is included in the chain file.
+
With multiple nodes, you need to add an appropriate number of node directories
with distinctive names, such as `node-sales`, `node-hr,` or whatever your
situation requires.

* _Does your trust path contain a single intermediate CA, or multiple
intermediate CAs?_ With only one CA, create one directory named `int`.
+
If you have multiple intermediate CAs, be sure to name them in a way that will
allow you to stack them properly in the chain file, such as `int1`, `int2`,
and so on.
This order will show that the intermediate CA closest to the node (which signed
the node certificate) has the higher number`.

[#configure-server-side-certificates]
== Configure Server-Side Certificates

The following steps configure X.509 certificates for Couchbase
Server on Ubuntu 16: a root certificate is created with a single intermediate
certificate and a single node certificate; and a chain certificate is created
from the intermediate and node certificates.
The chain certificate and node private key are then made active for the current
Couchbase Server-node.

Proceed as follows, using the `sudo` command where appropriate.

. Create environment variables for the naming of a directory-structure, within
which will reside the certificates you create for root, intermediate, and node.
+
[source,bash]
----
export TOPDIR=SSLCA
export ROOT_DIR=rootdir
export NODE_DIR=nodedir
export INT_DIR=intdir
----
+
Note that in cases where multiple intermediate and/or node certificates are to
be included in the certificate-chain, multiple intermediate and/or directories
are required — one for each intermediate or node certificate.

. Create environment variables for each of the certificate-files to be created.
+
[source,bash]
----
export ROOT_CA=ca
export INTERMEDIATE=int
export NODE=pkey
export CHAIN=chain
----
+
Note that in cases where multiple intermediate and/or node certificates are to
be included in the certificate-chain, additional environment-variable
definitions — one for each of the additional intermediate and/or node
certificates — are required.

. Create environment variables for the administrator-credentials to be used for
certificate management, the IP address at which the Couchbase Server-node is
located, and the username required for role-based access to a particular
resource.
+
[source,bash]
----
export ADMINCRED=Administrator:password
export ip=10.143.173.101
export USERNAME=travel-sample
----
+
Note that in this example, the username is specified as `travel-sample`,
which is typically associated with the *Bucket Full Access* role, on the
bucket _travel-sample_.
For access to be fully tested, ensure that the `travel-sample` user has
indeed been defined on the Couchbase Server-node, and is associated with the *Bucket Full Access* role.
(See xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization] for more information on
RBAC.)

. Create a directory-structure in which, within a top-level directory
named `SSLCA`, three subdirectories reside — `rootdir`, `intdir`, and
`nodedir` — respectively to hold the certificates you create for root,
intermediate, and node.
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ${TOPDIR}
cd ${TOPDIR}
mkdir ${ROOT_DIR}
mkdir ${INT_DIR}
mkdir ${NODE_DIR}
----

. Generate the root private key file (`ca.key`) and the public key file (`ca.pem`):
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ${ROOT_DIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${ROOT_CA}.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -sha256 -key ${ROOT_CA}.key \
-out ${ROOT_CA}.pem -subj '/C=UA/O=MyCompany/CN=MyCompanyRootCA'
----

. Generate, first, the intermediate private key (`int.key`); and secondly,
the intermediate certificate signing-request (`int.csr`):
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../${INT_DIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${INTERMEDIATE}.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ${INTERMEDIATE}.key -out ${INTERMEDIATE}.csr \
-subj '/C=UA/O=MyCompany/CN=MyCompanyIntermediateCA'
----

. Create the extension-file `v3_ca.ext`; in order to add extensions to the
certificate, and to generate the certificate signing-request:
+
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF>> ./v3_ca.ext
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
basicConstraints = CA:true
EOF
----

. Generate the intermediate public key (`int.pem`), based on the intermediate
certificate signing-request (`int.csr`), and signed by the root public key
(`ca.pem`).
+
[source,bash]
----
openssl x509 -req -in ${INTERMEDIATE}.csr \
-CA ../${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.pem -CAkey ../${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.key \
-CAcreateserial -CAserial ../${ROOT_DIR}/rootCA.srl -extfile ./v3_ca.ext \
-out ${INTERMEDIATE}.pem -days 365
----

. Generate, first, the node private key (`pkey.key`); secondly, the node
certificate signing-request (`pkey.csr`); and thirdly, the node public key
(`pkey.pem`).
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../${NODE_DIR}
openssl genrsa -out ${NODE}.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ${NODE}.key -out ${NODE}.csr \
-subj "/C=UA/O=MyCompany/CN=${USERNAME}"
openssl x509 -req -in ${NODE}.csr -CA ../${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem \
-CAkey ../${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.key -CAcreateserial \
-CAserial ../${INT_DIR}/intermediateCA.srl -out ${NODE}.pem -days 365
----

. Generate the certificate chain-file, by concatenating the node and
intermediate certificates.
This allows the client to verify the intermediate certificate against
the root certificate.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ..
cat ./${NODE_DIR}/${NODE}.pem ./${INT_DIR}/${INTERMEDIATE}.pem > ${CHAIN}.pem
----
+
Note that if multiple intermediate certificates are specified for concatenation in this way, the concatenation-order must correspond to the order of signing.
Thus, the node certificate, which appears in the first position, has been signed by the intermediate certificate, which therefore appears in the second position: and in cases where this intermediate certificate has itself been signed by a second intermediate certificate, the second intermediate certificate must appear in the third position, and so on.
+
Note also that the root certificate is never included in the chain.

. Manually copy the node private key (`pkey.key`) and the chain file (`chain.pem`) to the `inbox` folder of the Couchbase Server-node:
+
[{tabs}]
====
Ubuntu::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/
cp ./${CHAIN}.pem /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${CHAIN}.pem
chmod a+x /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${CHAIN}.pem
cp ./${NODE_DIR}/${NODE}.key /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${NODE}.key
chmod a+x /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${NODE}.key
----
--

macOS::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /Users/[name]/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/
cp ./${CHAIN}.pem /Users/[name]/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${CHAIN}.pem
chmod a+x /Users/[name]/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${CHAIN}.pem
cp ./${NODE_DIR}/${NODE}.key /Users/[name]/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${NODE}.key
chmod a+x /Users/[name]/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/${NODE}.key
----
--
====

. Upload the root certificate, and activate it:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST --data-binary "@./${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.pem" \
http://${ADMINCRED}@${ip}:8091/controller/uploadClusterCA
curl -X POST http://${ADMINCRED}@${ip}:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate
----
+
Note that alternatively, the following command-line interfaces can be used:
+
[source,bash]
----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c ${ip}:8091 -u Administrator -p password \
--upload-cluster-ca=./${ROOT_DIR}/${ROOT_CA}.pem
couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c ${ip}:8091 -u Administrator -p password \
--set-node-certificate
----

. For the current Couchbase Server-node, enable the client certificate:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -u ${ADMINCRED} -v -X POST http://${ip}:8091/settings/clientCertAuth \
-d '{"state": "enable","prefixes": [{"path": "subject.cn","prefix": "","delimiter": ""}]}'
----

== How-To

=== Generating a Certificate

The following steps describe how to create X.509 certificates for Couchbase Server.

. Create a new directory called *SSLCA*.
. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/x509-cert-scripts/gen_certificate.sh[gen_certificate.sh], link:{attachmentsdir}/x509-cert-scripts/openssl-san.cnf[openssl-san.cnf] and link:{attachmentsdir}/x509-cert-scripts/v3_ca.ext[v3_ca.ext] to the *SSLCA* directory.
. Open *openssl-san.cnf* and replace the Couchbase Server node IPs with the ones corresponding to your cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
IP.1 = 192.168.33.10
IP.2 = 192.168.33.14
IP.3 = 192.168.33.15
----
. Run *gen_certificates.sh* with the following parameters.
+
[source,bash]
----
./gen_certificates.sh USERNAME
----
* *USERNAME:* the RBAC user name to use for X.509 authentication.
This user must already exist.
+
If the command ran successfully, the console will output the following.
+
[source,text]
----
Generate ROOT CA
Generate Intermediate
Generate RSA
Signature ok
subject=/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=travel-sample
Getting CA Private Key
----

=== Installing a Certificate

Next, the certificate must be installed on each Couchbase Server node.
The generated private node key (`pkey.key`) and chain certificate (`chain.pem`) must be posted in a specific place that is in the certificate trust path.
This path is OS specific:

* macOS: [.path]_/Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/_
* Linux: [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/_

The following steps describe how to deploy the certificate to every node in the cluster.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/x509-cert-scripts/install_certificate.sh[install_certificate.sh] to the *SSLCA* directory.
. Run *install_certificates.sh* with the following parameters.
This script installs the certificate to the desired location for each node in the cluster.
+
[source,bash]
----
./install_certificate.sh CLUSTER_IP SSH_USER
----
* *USERNAME:* the RBAC user name to use for X.509 authentication.
This user must already exist.
* *CLUSTER_IP:* the IP address of the Couchbase Server cluster.
* *SSH_USER:* the user to access each node.
This is required to invoke SCP and SSH commands.

=== Configuring a Certificate

The following steps describe how to load the certificate for each node in the cluster.

. Download link:{attachmentsdir}/x509-cert-scripts/load_certificate.sh[load_certificate.sh] to the *SSLCA* directory.
. Run *load_certificate.sh* with the following parameters.
+
[source,bash]
----
./load_certificate.sh CLUSTER_IP
----
* *CLUSTER_IP:* the IP address of the Couchbase Server cluster.
