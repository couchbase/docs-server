= Enable Client-Certificate Handling

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be enabled to support certificate-based
authentication by networked clients.

[#certificate-based-client-authentication]
== Certificate-Based Client Authentication

Couchbase clients can be authenticated by means of X.509 certificates, but
only after client-certificate handling has been explicitly enabled. This
can be accomplished with the UI, the CLI, or the REST API.

[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-ui]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, in
the vertical navigation-bar, at the left-hand side of the Dashboard:
+
[#security-tab-with-hand-cursor]
image::manage-security/securityTabWithHandCursor.png[,110,align=left]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* screen, which appears as follows:
+
[#security-view-initial-no-users]
image::manage-security/securityViewInitialNoUsers.png[,820,align=left]
+
The initial, default view is for [.ui]*Users*.

. To manage client certificate
handling, left-click on the *Client Certificate* tab, on the upper,
horizontal control bar:
+
[#client-certificate-tab]
image::manage-security/clientCertificateTab.png[,210,align=left]
+
The *Client Certificate* options are now displayed:
+
[#client-certificate-panel]
image::manage-security/clientCertificateDisplay.png[,400,align=left]

. Specify whether certificates are enabled, and if so, whether manadatory. The
*Require Client Certificate* panel provides three options, as radio buttons.
These are:

* *Disable*:  Disables client based certificate authentication.
This is the default value.
* *Enable*:  When enabled, if the client presents a certificate,
then that certificate is used to authenticate.
If authentication fails, then access is denied.
However, if the client does not present a certificate, the certificate based
authentication will be bypassed.
* *mandatory*: The client must present a valid certificate in order to
gain access to Couchbase buckets.
+
Note, if you are using XDCR, *do not* use the `mandatory` state.

. In order to identify the client-certificates that will be presented for
authentication, specify one or more appropriate combinations of *Path*,
*Prefix*, and *Delimiter*. For an explanation of these values, see
xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Identity
Encoding in Client Certificates].

. Left-click on the *Save* button, to save the settings.

Client certificates will now be handled in accordance with your specification.

[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-cli]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the CLI

Use the [.cmd]`couchbase-cli` xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-ssl-manage.adoc#couchbaseclisslmanage1.idm68744912[ssl-manage] command:

----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage <options>
----

[cols="20,20,49"]
|===
| Options | Value | Description

| --set-client-auth-state
| disable {vbar} enable {vbar} mandatory
a|
Enable or disable the SSL client certificate authentication.

* [.param]`disable`: Disables client based certificate authentication.
This is the default value.
* [.param]`enable`:  When enabled, if the client presents a certificate,
then that certificate is used to authenticate.
If authentication fails, then access is denied.
However, if the client does not present a certificate, the certificate based
authentication will be bypassed.
* [.param]`mandatory`: The client must present a valid certificate in order to
gain access to Couchbase buckets.
If using XDCR, *do not* use the [.param]`mandatory` state for X.509 Certificate
Authentication.

| --set-client-auth-path
| subject.cn {vbar} san.uri {vbar} san.dnsname {vbar} san.email
| Set SSL client certificate type value.
This field will be used to extract the user name from the certificate.
Currently, only the fields specified in the values column are supported.

| --set-client-auth-prefix
| set_client_auth_prefix
| Set SSL client certificate prefix value.

| --set-client-auth-delimiter
| set_client_auth_delimiter
| Set SSL client certificate delimiter value.
The delimiter can either be a string or a character.
The parsing of the certificate for the user name ends when the delimiter value
is found.

| --client-auth
|
| Show SSL client certificate authentication value.
|===

After setting up the server side for client authentication, you should also
assign the users to some roles on the server side.
To do so:

. Create a user with authentication source (domain) 'Couchbase'.
. Ensure that this user is an internally managed user with a strong password.
While the password is not used as part of the certificate based authentication,
it is required if the user is trying to access the resources through the web console.

[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-rest-api]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the REST API

. Create a data file containing the payload for your certificate authentication settings.
For example, `cb-certauth-setting.json`:
+
----
{
	"state": "enable",
	"prefixes": [{
			"path": "san.uri",
			"prefix": "www.",
			"delimiter": "."
		},
		{
			"path": "san.email",
			"prefix": "couchbase.",
			"delimiter": "."
		}
	]
}
----
+
The `prefixes` field is an array of {_path_, _prefix_, _delimiters_} tuples, where:

** _path_ can be one of the following values: "subject.cn", "san.uri", "san.email", "san.dns".

** _prefix_ specifies the client certificate prefix value.

** _delimiters_ is a list of characters that can individually be treated as a delimiter.

+
The following constraints apply when specifying multiple tuples:

** A maximum of 10 {path, prefix,delimiters} tuples can be specified in the `prefixes` array.

** No two tuples can have the same `path` and `prefix` fields.

** All the fields in the tuple must be specified.

. Run the following command to enable x.509 certificate authentication on the server.
+
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @cb-certauth-setting.json http://Administrator:password@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/clientCertAuth
----

. To retrieve the client certificate authentication settings, run the following command:
+
----
curl -X GET  Administrator:password@localhost:8091/settings/clientCertAuth
----
+
This returns the following:
+
----
{"state":"enable","prefixes":[{"delimiter":".","path":"san.uri","prefix":"www."},{"delimiter":".","path":"san.email","prefix":"couchbase."}]}
----

[#client-certificates-and-server-upgrade]
== Client Certificates and Server Upgrade

On a cluster's upgrade to the current version of Couchbase Server, the
cluster will continue to return client-certificate
authentication-settings in the format of the earlier version until the cluster
is completely upgraded.
Once the cluster has been upgraded, any existing client certificate
authentication settings from earlier versions are automatically
transformed into the new format.
