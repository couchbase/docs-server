= Enable Client-Certificate Handling

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be enabled to support certificate-based client authentication.

[#certificate-based-client-authentication]
== Certificate-Based Client Authentication

Couchbase Server-clients can be authenticated by means of X.509 certificates: client-certificate handling must be explicitly enabled.
Enablement can be accomplished with the xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-ui]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar, at the left-hand side of the *Dashboard*:
+
[#security-tab-with-hand-cursor]
image::manage-security/securityTabWithHandCursor.png[,110,align=left]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* screen, which appears as follows:
+
[#security-view-initial-no-users]
image::manage-security/securityViewInitialNoUsers.png[,820,align=left]
+
The initial, default view is for [.ui]*Users*.

. To manage client certificate handling, left-click on the *Client Certificate* tab, on the upper, horizontal control bar:
+
[#client-certificate-tab]
image::manage-security/clientCertificateTab.png[,210,align=left]
+
The *Client Certificate* options are now displayed:
+
[#client-certificate-panel]
image::manage-security/clientCertificateDisplay.png[,400,align=left]

. Specify whether certificates are enabled, and if so, whether manadatory. The *Require Client Certificate* panel provides three options, as radio buttons.
These are:

* *Disable*:  Disables client certificate-based authentication.
This is the default value.

* *Enable*: Enables client certificate-based authentication.
When enabled, if the client presents a certificate, Couchbase Server attempts to extract a username from the certificate, and then to authenticate based on the extracted username.
If the client does not present a certificate, the certificate-based authentication-process is not triggered; and the client is expected to authenticate by some other means.

* *Mandatory*: Specifies that all clients _must_ present a certificate, in order to authenticate.
No other form of client-authentication is handled over the secure connection.
Note that imposing this level of security likely requires the additional measure of disabling non-secure console access: see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access].

. If *Require Client Certificate* has been set to either *Enable* or *Mandatory*, establish how the username within each client certificate is to be determined.
+
Each certificate is expected to provide a _username_ as part of its content.
Frequently, the username is specified as the certificate's _Subject Common Name_; but it may also be expressed as a _Subject Alternative Name_.
+
These certificate-configuration options are described in detail in xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Specifying Usernames for Client-Certificate Authentication]; and practical examples of their use are provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc[Configure Client Certificates].
The administrator who configures client-certificate handling on Couchbase Server is expected to anticipate what forms of username-specification are likely to occur in the certificates used by client applications, and to decide how they should be handled.
+
To enable Couchbase Server to identify the usernames embedded in client certificates, specify one or more appropriate combinations of *Path*, *Prefix*, and *Delimiter*.
Add and delete rows as appropriate, by left-clicking on the *+* and *-* buttons.
Note that the default option is *subject.cn*, which indicates that the _Subject Common Name_ within the certificate will be considered a username.
+
For an explanation of *Path*, *Prefix*, and *Delimiter* values, see
xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#identity-encoding-in-client-certificates[Specifying Usernames for Client-Certificate Authentication].
Note that *Prefix* and *Delimiter* are optional; and their fields can therefore be left blank.

. Left-click on the *Save* button, to save settings.
Client certificates will now be handled in accordance with your specification.

[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-cli]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the CLI

To use the Couchbase CLI to enable and configure client-certificate handling, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-ssl-manage.adoc[ssl-manage] command.
The value assigned to the `--set-client-auth` parameter of this command should be a JSON document that lists the _enablement state_ and the _path-prefix-delimiter_ combinations for client-certificate handling.
The document may appear as follows:

----
{
  "state": "enable",
  "prefixes": [
    {
      "path": "san.uri",
      "prefix": "www.",
      "delimiter": "."
    },
    {
      "path": "san.email",
      "prefix": "",
      "delimiter": "@"
    }
  ]
}
----

The value of `state` can be `enable`, `disable`, or `mandatory`.
See the xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc#client-certificate-enablement-values[definitions] provided above.
Each of the elements specified in the `prefixes` array must be a tuple of three key-value pairs, whose respective keys are `path`, `prefix`, and `delimiter`.
Each tuple thus specifies an element in the client certificate that is to be extracted and used as a username for authentication:

* _path_ must be one of the following values: "subject.cn", "san.uri", "san.email", "san.dns".

* _prefix_ specifies the client certificate prefix value.
If no prefix is to be used, the value must be specified as an empty string.

* _delimiters_ is a list of characters that can individually be treated as a delimiter.
If no delimiter is to be used, the value must be specified as an empty string.

Note the following constraints when specifying multiple tuples:

* A maximum of 10 {path, prefix, delimiters} tuples can be specified in the `prefixes` array.

* No two tuples can have the same `path` and `prefix` fields.

* All the fields in the tuple must be specified.

If the document is saved as a local file, the command can be executed as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 10.143.192.102 \
-u Administrator -p password \
--set-client-auth ./client-auth-settings.json
----

To check the results, use the same command with the `--client-auth` option:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c 10.143.192.102 \
-u Administrator -p password \
--client-auth
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
{
  "prefixes": [
    {
      "delimiter": ".",
      "path": "san.uri",
      "prefix": "www."
    },
    {
      "delimiter": "@",
      "path": "san.email",
      "prefix": ""
    }
  ],
  "state": "enable"
}
----

This confirms that the settings have been successfully updated.



[#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-rest-api]
== Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the REST API

Couchbase Server client-certificate handling can be enabled with the REST API, using the `POST /settings/clientCertAuth` http method and URI.
The call requires creation of a JSON document that lists the _enablement state_ and the _path-prefix-delimiter_ combinations for client-certificate handling; as described above in xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc#enable-client-certificate-handling-with-the-cli[Enable Client-Certificate Handling with the CLI].

Enter the following:

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.192.102:8091/settings/clientCertAuth \
--data-binary @client-auth-settings.json \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns a `200 OK` message.
To check the resulting configuration, use the `GET /settings/clientCertAuth` http method and URI, as follows.
Note that this example is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] command, to optimize readability.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.143.192.102:8091/settings/clientCertAuth \
-u Administrator:password | jq
----

If successful, the call returns the following:

----
{
  "state": "enable",
  "prefixes": [
    {
      "delimiter": ".",
      "path": "san.uri",
      "prefix": "www."
    },
    {
      "delimiter": "@",
      "path": "san.email",
      "prefix": ""
    }
  ]
}
----

This confirms that the settings have been successfully updated.

[#client-certificates-and-server-upgrade]
== Client Certificates and Server Upgrade

On a cluster's upgrade to the current version of Couchbase Server, the cluster will continue to return client-certificate authentication-settings in the format of the earlier version until the cluster is completely upgraded.
Once the cluster has been upgraded, any existing client-certificate authentication-settings from earlier versions are automatically transformed into the new format.
