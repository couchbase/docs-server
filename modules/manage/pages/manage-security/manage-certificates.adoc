Couchbase Server supports the use of X.509 certificates, for the encryption
of networked communications.

== Certificate Management Overview

A conceptual and architectural overview of Couchbase Server's support of
X.509 certificates is provided in
xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates]. The
current section provides practical steps for:

* _Configuring server certificates_: These reside on Couchbase Server-nodes,
and identify the cluster to networked clients.

* _Configuring client certificates_: These can be used by networked clients to
authenticate with Couchbase Server.

Additionally, procecedures are providing for the rotating of server
certificates, to ensure optimal secure; the enablement of client-certificate
handling on the current cluster; and the handling of errors related to
certificate management.
