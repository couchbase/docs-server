[#couchbase-security-settings]
== Couchbase Security Settings
The basic settings for Couchbase security, available to _Full_ and
_Security_ administrators, allow configuration of the following:

* _Users & Groups_: Users and groups can be created, given passwords, and assigned roles that
allow them to access specific system resources.

* The _Root Certificate_ for the node, which allows the server to identify
itself to clients.

* _Client Certificate_ settings, which determine whether a client can or
must present a certificate in order to authenticate with the server.

* _Audit_ settings, determining which system events are audited.

* _Log Redaction_ settings, determining what forms of content are to be considered private, and redacted from system logs.

* _Session_ management setting, whereby users are logged out of Couchbase Web Console after a specified period of inactivity.

These areas are described below.

[#access-security-screen]
== Access the Security Screen

To start managing Couchbase Server security-settings, within Couchbase Web Console, access the *Security* screen, by means of the *Security* tab, on the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-security-screen-image]
image::manage-security/accessSecurityScreen.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *Security* screen, which appears as follows:

[#couchbase-security-view]
image::manage-security/securityView.png[,800,align=left]

Note the tabs that run from left to right, along the upper, horizontal control-bar. These are *Users*, *Root Certificate*, *Client Certificate*, *Audit*, *Log Redaction*, and *Session*. To display the corresponding screen-content for each, left-click on the tab:

[#access-users-panel]
image::manage-security/accessUsersPanel.png[,150,align=left]

Note also that the upper area of the screen displays notices regarding the enablement-status of _saslauthd_ and _LDAP_, which can be used in support of _external_ user-authentication.
See xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc[Authentication Domains], for details.

[#users-security-screen-display]
== Users & Groups

The *Users & Groups* display (shown above) lists users and groups currently registered on
the cluster.
The display can be toggled, to provide information for either users or groups.

Each user has a *username* and (optionally) a *full name*; and can have one or more *roles* associated with them.
These roles are themselves associated with _privileges_ that permit access to specified system-resources.
The *auth domain* for each user can be _Local_ or _External_.
To add users and, in so doing, assign them roles, administrators use the *ADD USER* button, at the upper right.
Additionally, each user can be made a member of a defined _group_.

Each defined group has a *group name* and (optionally) a *description*; and can have one or more *roles* assigned to it.
If a user becomes a member of a group, the user inherts all the group's assigned roles.
A group can also be assigned a _mapping_ to an LDAP group that is maintained on a remote, LDAP server.
For information on how _Native LDAP Support_ can be used to support mappings, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

A full account of adding and editing users and groups is provided in
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups, and Roles].

[#root-certificate-security-screen-display]
== Root Certificate

This displays the _Root Certificate_ for the cluster:

[#root-certificate-panel]
image::manage-security/rootCertificateDisplay.png[,600,align=left]

Initially, before
any administrator-driven configuration has occurred, this is a _self-signed_
certificate. To increase system-security, a new X.509 certificate should be
created.

See
xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure
Server Certificates], for further information.

Note that the procedures for securing _Cross Data Center Replication_ (XDCR)
may involve use of the root certificate: if so, the certificate can be
copied from this screen. See
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc[Secure
a Replication] for details.

[#client-certificate-security-screen-display]
== Client Certificate

This displays the settings for the cluster's handling of certificates,
presented by clients attempting access:

[#client-certificate-panel]
image::manage-security/clientCertificateDisplay.png[,400,align=left]

The user interface allows the handling of client certificates to be
_enabled_, and optionally to be made _mandatory_. Note that such
handling is _disabled_ by default. The *Path*, *Prefix*, and *Delimiter*
fields allow the specification of which details within the client certificate
are to be used by the server for client-identification.

An explanation of how to use this interface is provided in
xref:manage:manage-security/enable-client-certificate-handling.adoc[Enable
Client-Certificate Handling].
A detailed account of establishing client-certificate settings is provided in
xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc[Configure
Client Certificates].

[#audit-security-screen-display]
== Audit

This displays the _audit_ options for the cluster:

[#audit-options-panel]
image::manage-security/auditOptionsDisplay.png[,460,align=left]

The options permit selection of the directory within which the audit log
file is to be saved, and the frequency with which it will be _rotated_.
Specific events can also be included in the audit process, or excluded
from it.

For further information, see
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage
Auditing].

[#log-redaction-security-screen-display]
== Log Redaction

This allows specification of whether log files should be _redacted_:

[#log-redaction-panel]
image::manage-security/logRedactionDisplay.png[,300,align=left]

A redacted log file is one purged of sensitive information: this allows
log files to be shared for review purposes, without private data being
compromised.

For detailed information, see
xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[Manage
Logging].

[#session-security-screen-display]
== Session

This allows sessions with Couchbase Web Console to be terminated, following
a specified period of user-inactivity:

[#session-timeout-panel]
image::manage-security/sessionTimeoutPanel.png[,260,align=left]

For information on how to use, see
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-sessions.adoc[Manage Sessions].
