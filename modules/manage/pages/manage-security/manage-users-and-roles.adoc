= Manage Users and Roles
:page-aliases: security:security-rbac-user-management,security:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps

[abstract]
Couchbase RBAC allows defined _users_ to be assigned roles, which permit access to resources.

[#user-creation-overview]
== User-Creation Overview

Users, passwords, and roles can be managed by means of:

* Couchbase Web Console (see below).

* The CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-user-manage.adoc[user-manage].

* The REST API method `/settings/rbac/users`. See
xref:rest-api:rbac.adoc[Role Based Admin Access].

[#creating-and-managing-users-with-the-UI]
== Creating and Managing Users with the UI

Using Couchbase Web Console, you can assign roles to users interactively.
The administrator who initially performs installation and configuration of Couchbase Server is granted the role of _Full Administrator_, with read-write access to the entire system.
Once basic system-configuration has been completed, the Full Administrator is free to add other users to the system, and assign them roles; thereby specifying their access-privileges.

[#adding-users]
=== Adding Users

As Full Administrator, to add _users_ (each of which might be either an _administrator_ or an _application_) to Couchbase Server, use the Couchbase Web Console.
Access the [.ui]*Dashboard*, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, on the vertical navigation-bar, at the left.
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* view, as follows:

[#security_view]
image::manage-security/securityView.png[,820,align=left]

The [.ui]*Security* view allows users to be defined, and roles to be allocated to them.
It also allows management of the [.ui]*Root* and [.ui]*Client* certificates; of [.ui]*Audit*-processing; of [.ui]*Log Redaction*; and of [.ui]*Session* timeouts.

Note that in some cases, the following notification may appear towards the upper left:

[#external_auth_not_enabled]
image::manage-security/externalAuthNotEnabled.png[,250,align=left]

This indicates that the ability to define users externally by means of `saslauthd` has not yet been enabled.
To enable, use the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-saslauthd.adoc[setting-saslauthd]. For example:

----
couchbase-cli setting-saslauthd -c 10.143.192.101 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--saslauthd-enabled 1
----

This changes the notification to the following:

[#external_auth_enabled]
image::manage-security/externalAuthEnabled.png[,250,align=left]

Note that setting `saslauthd` is only required for external authentication by systems other than LDAP.
The recommended procedure for external authentication based on LDAP is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].
For an overview of external authentication options, see
xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#introduction-to-externally-based-authentication[Externally Based Authentication].

To add a user, left-click on the [.ui]*Add User* control, at the upper right.
The [.ui]*Add New User* dialog now appears:

[#manage_user_new]
image::manage-security/addNewUserDialogInitial.png[,420,align=left]

[#add-a-locally-authenticated-user]
=== Add a Locally Authenticated User

The [.ui]*Authentication Domain* panel features two checkboxes: one specifying [.ui]*Couchbase*, the other [.ui]*External*.
By default, [.ui]*Couchbase* is checked: this means that the user will be defined locally, and that a user-password must therefore be created, using the [.ui]*Password* fields displayed on the dialog.

Add a locally authenticated user, by adding appropriate entries into the [.ui]*Username* and [.ui]*Password* fields.
See xref:learn:security/usernames-and-passwords.adoc[Usernames and Passwords] for requirements.
The [.ui]*Full Name* field may be left blank.

[#adding-roles]
==== Adding Roles

Roles can be specified by checking checkboxes in the [.ui]*Roles* panel, which is displayed by default:

[#add_new_user_dialog_roles_panel]
image::manage-security/addNewUserDialogRolesPanel.png[,280,align=left]

Roles are arranged in groups.
The first group, which appears at the top of the panel, is for *Administration & Global Roles*: this roles are either administrative, or involve access to cluster-wide features.
Subsequent groups appear below the first: each consists of roles that are applied _per bucket_.
By default, a single subsequent group is displayed, *All Buckets (*)*.
Each individual bucket on the cluster will be represented below *All Buckets (*)*, with its own hierarchy of roles.
This allows each individual user to be assigned roles either that apply to all buckets defined on the cluster, or to individual buckets.
Left-click on the corresponding right-pointing arrowhead to display a group's contents, scrolling down if necessary:

[#all_buckets_checkboxes]
image::manage-security/allBucketsCheckboxes.png[,280,align=left]

To display roles at lower levels of the *All Buckets (*)* hierarchy, left-click on the right-pointing arrowheads.

To assign roles to the user, simply check the appropriate checkboxes.
Then, left-click on the *Add User* button, at the lower right.

Note that some roles are considered to be _subsets_ of others.
In such cases, manually checking one checkbox may trigger the automated checking of others â€” indicating that the corresponding roles are also assigned to the user.
To demonstrate this, left-click on the [.ui]*Full Admin* checkbox, near the top.
The [.ui]*Roles* panel now appears as follows:

[#roles_panel_admin_checked]
image::manage-security/rolesPanelAdminChecked.png[,280,align=left]

As illustrated, selecting the [.ui]*Full Admin* role causes all other roles
also to become selected: this is because [.ui]*Full Admin* stands at the top
of the hierarchy, and is a superset of all other roles.

[#saving-and-making-changes]
=== Saving and Making Changes

Whenever you have finished allocating roles to a particular user, left-click
on [.ui]*Add User*.
The dialog disappears, and the [.ui]*Security* view now displays, on the row
of the corresponding [.ui]*username*, the roles you have allocated.
For example, if you have allocated [.ui]*Data Reader* and [.ui]*Data Writer*
on [.ui]*travel-sample*, the view is as follows:

[#security_view_with_new_user]
image::manage-security/securityViewWithNewUser.png[,720,align=left]

Note that by left-clicking within the row, you display options for editing:

[#security_view_with_edit_options]
image::manage-security/securityViewWithEditOptions.png[,720,align=left]

By left-clicking on [.ui]*Delete*, you delete the user.
By left-clicking on [.ui]*Edit*, you bring up the [.ui]*Edit testUser* dialog,
with the options to redefine username, full name, and roles (the content of this dialog is very similar to that of the [.ui]*Add New User* dialog, examined in detail above).
The btn:[Reset Password] button only appears when the selected user is
_locally_ defined.
Left-clicking on the button brings up a dialog that allows redefinition of the
user's password:

[#reset_password]
image::manage-security/resetPassword.png[,260,align=left]

For a complete account of the roles you can allocate and their significance,
see xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

[#adding-an-externally-authenticated-user]
=== Adding an Externally Authenticated User

An _externally authenticated_ user is not authenticated on Couchbase Server.
Instead, they are authenticated on a server external to the cluster.
This means that the user's password is maintained externally.

External authentication must be supported by xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#native-ldap-support[Native LDAP], xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#using-saslauthd[saslauthd], or xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#introduction-to-pam-based-authentication[PAM].
Appropriate set-up procedures must have been completed prior to the addition of externally authenticated users.

For the detailed steps required to establish external authentication by means of Native LDAP (which is the recommended mechanism), see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

To add an externally authenticated user, on the *Add New User* dialog, select the *External* option:

image::manage-security/externalUserRadioButton.png[,120,align=middle]

This removes the password-related fields from the dialog, since they are not required for the creation of an externally authenticated user.
The fields for the user's names remain, and can be used.

The view provided by the dialog's right-hand panel can be toggled, by means of the *Roles* and *Groups* tabs, which appear above the panel:

image::manage-security/rolesAndGroupsToggle.png[,120,align=middle]

The *Roles* option can be used for externally authenticated users, just as it is used for locally authenticated users.
The only difference is that no user-password need be specified.

The *Groups* option can only be used when _Native LDAP_ has been established as the means of external authentication, and _LDAP group-support_ has been enabled.
It provides a _group-mapping_, whereby a user-group defined on Couchbase Server is mapped to an LDAP group on an external server, and the user's LDAP-group membership can thus be used to give them the roles assigned to a Couchbase Server user-group.
See xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#native-ldap-support[Native LDAP], for an overview; and xref:manage:manage-security/configure-LDAP.adoc[Configure LDAP], for practical configuration steps.

[#add-an-externally-authenticated-user-individually]
==== Add an Externally Authenticated User without Group-Mapping

If the externally authenticated user is _not_ to be associated with an LDAP-group mapping, assign roles individually, using the *Roles* view, just as you would for a locally authenticated user.
For example:

image::manage-security/addNewIndividualLDAPuser.png[,420,align=middle]

Then, left-click on the *Add User* button.

image::manage-security/addUserTab2.png[,120,align=middle]

The *Users & Groups* panel now appears as follows:

image::manage-security/externalUserIndividual.png[,720,align=middle]

The new external user is listed, with their *auth domain* specified as `External`.

[#add-an-externally-authenticated-user-by-group]
==== Add an Externally Authenticated User with Group-Mapping

If the externally authenticated user _is_ to be associated with an LDAP-group mapping, do not assign roles to the user individually.
Instead, toggle the right-hand panel, by left-clicking on the *Groups* tab:

image::manage-security/groupsTab.png[,120,align=middle]

This displays the Couchbase-Server user-groups that have been mapped to LDAP groups:

image::manage-security/groupsPanel.png[,140,align=middle]

A single user-group is thus shown to have been created, called `Admins`.
For details of the mapping procedure, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

To add an externally authenticated user with this group-mapping, specify the user's username, and check the checkbox for the displayed group:

image::manage-security/addExternalUserGroup.png[,420,align=middle]

Left-click on *Add User*, to save.
The *Users & Groups* screen now appears as follows:

image::manage-security/usersAndGroupsTwoUsers.png[,800,align=middle]


image::manage-security/usersAndGroupsSelectGroups.png[,260,align=middle]

image::manage-security/usersAndGroupsGroupsView.png[,720,align=middle]

Once the group has been saved, the *User Groups* screen is displayed with the new group visible:

[#groups-screen-complete]
image::manage-security/groupsScreenComplete.png[,600,align=left]

=== Role-Based Console Appearance

Role-assignment determines which features of Couchbase Web Console are
available to the administrator.
Non-available features are not displayed: therefore, the console's appearance
changes, based on which roles have been assigned to the current user.
