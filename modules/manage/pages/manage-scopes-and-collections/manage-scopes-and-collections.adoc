== Understanding Scopes and Collections

_Scopes_ and _collections_ allow documents to be categorized and organized, within a bucket.
A _collection_ is a data container, defined on Couchbase Server, within a bucket whose type is either _Couchbase_ or _Ephemeral_.
A _scope_ is a mechanism for the grouping of multiple collections.
A complete overview is provided in xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections].
