== Understanding Scopes and Collections

_Scopes_ and _collections_ allow documents to be categorized and organized, within a bucket.
A _collection_ is a data container, defined on Couchbase Server, within a bucket whose type is either _Couchbase_ or _Ephemeral_.
A _scope_ is a mechanism for the grouping of multiple collections.
A complete overview is provided in xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections].

== Manage Scopes and Collections with the UI

The following sequence demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections, using the UI of Couchbase Web Console.
Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the *Buckets* tab, in the vetical, left-hand navigation bar:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/leftClickOnBucketsTab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Buckets* screen.

. Add a new bucket, named *testBucket*.
Left-click on the *ADD BUCKET* tab, at the upper right:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/addBucketTab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Data Bucket* dialog.
Use this to create *testBucket* as a Couchbase bucket of 256 MB, as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/createTestBucket.png[,400,align=left]
+
Left-click on the *Add Bucket* button, to create.
The *Buckets* screen now displays the newly created bucket:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/bucketsScreenWithNewBucket.png[,720,align=left]

. Examine the new bucket's _default collection_.
At the right-hand side of the row that displays the new bucket, two options appear: *Documents* and *Scopes & Collections*.
Left-click on the *Scopes & Collections* option:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/selectCollectionsOption.png[,190,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Scopes & Collections* screen, which appears as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/scopesAndCollectionsScreenInitial.png[,720,align=left]
+
The screen features a single row, which confirms the existence of the *_default* scope.
As its name indicates, this scope is created by default for each new bucket.
Collections that are created without any administrator-defined scope specified as their destination are duly saved in the *_default* scope.
+
To examine the contents of the *_default* scope, left-click on the row.
The row expands as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/sACscreenWithDefaultSandC.png[,720,align=left]
+
This indicates that the *_default* scope contains a single collection, which is the *_default* collection.
As its name indicates, this collection is create by default, within the *_default* scope, for each new bucket.
Documents that are created without any administrator-defined collection specified as their destination are duly saved in the *_default* collection.
+
. Add a scope to the bucket.
Left-click on the *ADD SCOPE* tab, at the upper right of the screen:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addScope.png[,90,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Scope* dialog, which appears as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addScopeDialog.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the name of a new scope into the *New Scope Name* field: for example, *MyScope*.
Then, left-click on the *Save* button.
+
The *Scopes & Collections* screen now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/sACscreenWithNewScope.png[,720,align=left]
+
The new scope, *MyScope*, is now displayed.

. Add a new collection, within the new scope.
At the extreme right of the row for *MyScope* are two options: *Drop* and *Add Collection*.
Left-click on *Add Collection*:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addCollection.png[,110,align=left]
+
This brings up a dialog entitled *Add Collection into MyScope scope*:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addCollectionDialog.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the name of a new collection into the *Name* field: for example, *MyCollection*.
Left-click on the *Save* button.
+
Next, left-click on the row for *MyScope*.
The row expands, as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/newCollectionInNewScope.png[,720,align=left]
+
The new collection, *MyCollection*, is thus shown to have been created within the scope *MyScope*.

[#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-cli]
== Manage Scopes and Collections with the CLI

The following sequence of CLI commands demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections.
Proceed as follows:

At the command-line prompt, proceed as follows:

. Create a bucket, named `test-bucket`, using the couchbase-cli `bucket-create` command.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli bucket-create \
--cluster localhost:8091 --username Administrator \
--password password --bucket testBucket --bucket-type couchbase \
--bucket-ramsize 100
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Bucket created
----
+
For more information on this command, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc[bucket-create].

. Using the `cbstats` command, check that collections have been enabled, and check the maximum size for collections, then for scopes:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password localhost:11210 -b testBucket all | grep collections
----
+
The following output is displayed:
+
----
ep_collections_enabled:                                true
ep_collections_max_size:                               1000
----
+
This indicates that collections are enabled, and that a maximum number 1000 collections can be created for the bucket.
+
Check the maximum size for scopes:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password localhost:11210 -b testBucket all | grep scopes
----
+
The following output is displayed:
+
----
ep_scopes_max_size:                                    100
----
+
The output indicates that a maximum number of 100 scopes can be created for the bucket.

. Create a scope, using the couchbase-cli `collection-manage` command.
The `--bucket` parameter specifies the name of the bucket within which the scope will be created; and the `--create-scope` parameter specifies the name of the scope.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage \
--cluster http://localhost:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-scope my_scope
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Scope created
----

. List the scopes now contained by the bucket `testBucket`.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage \
-c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-scopes
----
+
The following output is displayed:
+
----
_default
my_scope
----
+
This indicates that `testBucket` now contains two scopes.
One is the `_default`, the other is the newly created scope `my_scope`.

. Use `collection-manage` successively, to create two collections within `my_scope`.
The name of the collection to be created is specified with the `--create-collection` parameter, using a path in dot format (that is, in the form _scope-name.collection-name_) to specify the destination scope.
Then, list the collections in the scope, using collection-manage with the `--list-collections` parameter.
+
Create the `my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_1` collection:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
On success, the output is as follows:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Create the `my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_2` collection:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
On success, the output is as again follows:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Now, list all collections:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-collections my_scope
----
+
If the command is successful, the output features a list of all created collections within `my_scope`:
+
----
my_collection_in_my_scope_1
my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
The output indicates that `my_scope` now contains the collections `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` and `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`.

. Create a collection in the `_default` scope, and then list collections within that scope.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection _default.my_collection_in_default_scope
----
+
On success, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Now, list collections within the scope:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-collections _default
----
+
On success, a list of the collections in the scope is displayed:
+
----
my_collection_in_default_scope
_default
----
+
The output indicates that the _default scope now contains two collections, which are the `_default` collection, and the newly created collection `my_collection_in_default_scope`.

. Create two documents, within the default scope and collection, using the `cbc create` command.
Note that if no scope or collection is explicitly specified, the default scope and collection are assumed.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc create -u Administrator -P password testDocument1 \
-U couchbase://localhost/testBucket \
-V '{"key1" : "value1"}'
----
+
On success, this produces output indicating that the named document has been saved, and providing its _CAS_ number.
+
----
testDocument1       Stored. CAS=0x15833ec67e800000
----
+
Now, create the second document:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc create -u Administrator -P password testDocument2 \
-U couchbase://10.143.192.101/testBucket \
-V '{"key2" : "value2"}'
----
+
On success, the output is as follows:
+
----
testDocument2       Stored. CAS=0x15833ec889540000
----

. Display statistics on existing collections, using the `cbstats` command, specifying the collections parameter.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 collections
----
+
Statistics are displayed as follows:
+
----
collection:0x0:items:         2
collection:0x8:items:         0
collection:0x9:items:         0
collection:0xa:items:         0
manifest:collection:0x0:name: _default
manifest:collection:0x8:name: my_collection_in_my_scope_1
manifest:collection:0x9:name: my_collection_in_my_scope_2
manifest:collection:0xa:name: my_collection_in_default_scope
manifest:collections:         4
manifest:default_exists:      true
manifest:uid:                 4
----
+
Note that the output identifies the `_default` collection as `0x0`, and indicates that this contains 2 items: these correspond to the two documents previously created with `cbc create`.

. Again display statistics on existing collections using the `cbstats` command, this time specifying the `collections-details` parameter.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password -b testBucket \
localhost:11210 collections-details
----
+
Statistics are displayed as follows:
+
----
manifest:collection:0x0:name:                      _default
manifest:collection:0x8:name:                      my_collection_in_my_scope_1

vb_0:collection:0x9:entry:high_seqno:              3
vb_0:collection:0x9:entry:items:                   0
 	.
	.
----
+
The output, which is presented here in truncated form, provides additional details on scopes, collections, and their content; including sequence numbers, uid numbers, and per-vBucket information. Note that an identifying vBucket-number can be specified, to produce output for that vBucket alone:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password -b testBucket localhost:11210 collections-details 8
----

This indicates that `my_scope`, and the collection it contained, `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`, have been dropped.

This concludes the sequence of commands.

[#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-rest-api]
== Manage Scopes and Collections with the REST API

The following sequence of REST API commands demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections.
Proceed as follows:

At the command-line prompt, proceed as follows:

. Create a bucket, named `testBucket`, using the `/pools/default/buckets` REST method:
+
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-d name=testBucket \
-d ramQuotaMB=100
----
+
For information on this REST call and its parameters, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

. Create a scope. This is a POST operation, using the `/pools/default/buckets/_<bucket>_/collections` endpoint, and specifying the `-name` parameter.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections \
-d name=my_scope
----
+
If successful, the command returns a _uid_ for the action (this is principally for internal use, and need not be tracked by the user):
+
----
{"uid":1}
----
+
Now, examine the collections _manifest_ for the specified bucket.
This is a GET operation, using the same endpoint as the previous POST, with no parameter.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
This returns the following output:
+
----
{"uid":"1","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
Formatted, this output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "1",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": []
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This output shows that the bucket now contains two scopes, which are `my_scope` and `_default`.
The `_default` scope contains a single collection, which is also named `_default`.

. Create two collections, within the created scope.
This requires a POST operation, specifying the created scope as endpoint, and using the -name parameter to specify the new collection-name.
For the first collection, enter the following command:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/my_scope \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
If successful, the operation returns a uid.
+
----
{"uid":2}
----
+
Create the second collection as follows:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/my_scope \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
Again, success returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":3}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
The unformatted output is as follows:
+
----
{"uid":"3","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9"},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8"}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
When formatted, the output takes the following appearance:
+
----
{
  "uid": "3",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9"
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that the collections `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` and `my_collection_in_my_scope_2` have been successfully created in `my_scope`.

. Create a collection in the default scope.
This is a POST operation, specifying the `_default` scope as endpoint, and the `-name` parameter to specify the new collection-name.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/_default \
-d name=my_collection_in_default_scope
----
+
A uid is returned:
+
----
{"uid":4}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
This returns the following:
+
----
{"uid":"4","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9"},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8"}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_default_scope","uid":"a"},{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
When formatted the output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "4",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9"
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a"
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
