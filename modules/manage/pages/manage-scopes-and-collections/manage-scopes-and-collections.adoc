== Understanding Scopes and Collections

_Scopes_ and _collections_ allow documents to be categorized and organized, within a bucket.
A _collection_ is a data container, defined on Couchbase Server, within a bucket whose type is either _Couchbase_ or _Ephemeral_.
A _scope_ is a mechanism for the grouping of multiple collections.
A complete overview is provided in xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections].

[#examples-on-this-page]
== Examples on This Page

The examples on this page demonstrate how to manage scopes and collections with the xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-ui]
== Manage Scopes and Collections with the UI

The following sequence demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections, using the UI of Couchbase Web Console.
Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the *Buckets* tab, in the vertical, left-hand navigation bar:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/leftClickOnBucketsTab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Buckets* screen.

. Add a new bucket, named *testBucket*.
Left-click on the *ADD BUCKET* tab, at the upper right:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/addBucketTab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Data Bucket* dialog.
Use this to create *testBucket* as a Couchbase bucket of 256 MB, as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/createTestBucket.png[,400,align=left]
+
Left-click on the *Add Bucket* button, to create.
The *Buckets* screen now displays the newly created bucket:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/bucketsScreenWithNewBucket.png[,720,align=left]

. Examine the new bucket's _default collection_.
At the right-hand side of the row that displays the new bucket, two options appear: *Documents* and *Scopes & Collections*.
Left-click on the *Scopes & Collections* option:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/selectCollectionsOption.png[,190,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Scopes & Collections* screen, which appears as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/scopesAndCollectionsScreenInitial.png[,720,align=left]
+
The screen features a single row, which confirms the existence of the *_default* scope.
As its name indicates, this scope is created by default for each new bucket.
Collections that are created without any administrator-defined scope specified as their destination are duly saved in the *_default* scope.
+
To examine the contents of the *_default* scope, left-click on the row.
The row expands as follows:
+
image::manage-scopes-and-collections/sACscreenWithDefaultSandC.png[,720,align=left]
+
This indicates that the *_default* scope contains a single collection, which is the *_default* collection.
As its name indicates, this collection is created by default, within the *_default* scope, for each new bucket.
Documents that are created without any administrator-defined collection specified as their destination are duly saved in the *_default* collection.
+
. Add a scope to the bucket.
Left-click on the *ADD SCOPE* tab, at the upper right of the screen:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addScope.png[,90,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Scope* dialog, which appears as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addScopeDialog.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the name of a new scope into the *New Scope Name* field: for example, *MyScope*.
Then, left-click on the *Save* button.
+
The *Scopes & Collections* screen now appears as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/sACscreenWithNewScope.png[,720,align=left]
+
The new scope, *MyScope*, is now displayed.

. Add a new collection, within the new scope.
At the extreme right of the row for *MyScope* are two options: *Drop* and *Add Collection*.
Left-click on *Add Collection*:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addCollection.png[,110,align=left]
+
This brings up a dialog entitled *Add Collection into MyScope scope*:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/addCollectionDialog.png[,400,align=left]
+
Enter the name of a new collection into the *Name* field: for example, *MyCollection*.
The *Collection Max Time-To-Live* field can, for this example, be left at its default value of `0` &#8212; which indicates that no _expiration_ value is assigned to the collection and the documents it contains.
(For information, see xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration]).
Left-click on the *Save* button.
+
Next, left-click on the row for *MyScope*.
The row expands, as follows:
+
image:manage-scopes-and-collections/newCollectionInNewScope.png[,720,align=left]
+
The new collection, *MyCollection*, is thus shown to have been created within the scope *MyScope*.

[#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-cli]
== Manage Scopes and Collections with the CLI

The following sequence of CLI commands demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections.

Note that the create bucket, scope, and collection commands are asynchronous by default. If you create a collection right after creating a scope, or create an index right after creating a collection, it is possible that you may encounter a failure if the cluster is still being updated. In this case, we recommend that the application wait for the cluster to be updated or retry the operation.

Proceed as follows:

At the command-line prompt, proceed as follows:

. Create a bucket, named `testBucket`, using the couchbase-cli `bucket-create` command.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli bucket-create \
--cluster localhost:8091 --username Administrator \
--password password --bucket testBucket --bucket-type couchbase \
--bucket-ramsize 100
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Bucket created
----
+
For more information on this command, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc[bucket-create].

. Create a scope, using the couchbase-cli `collection-manage` command.
The `--bucket` parameter specifies the name of the bucket within which the scope will be created; and the `--create-scope` parameter specifies the name of the scope.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage \
--cluster http://localhost:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-scope my_scope
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Scope created
----

. List the scopes now contained by the bucket `testBucket`.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage \
-c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-scopes
----
+
The following output is displayed:
+
----
my_scope
_default
----
+
This indicates that `testBucket` now contains two scopes.
One is the `_default`, the other is the newly created scope `my_scope`.

. Use `collection-manage` successively, to create two collections within `my_scope`.
The name of the collection to be created is specified with the `--create-collection` parameter, using a path in dot format (that is, in the form _scope-name.collection-name_) to specify the destination scope.
Then, list the collections in the scope, using collection-manage with the `--list-collections` parameter.
+
Create the `my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_1` collection:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_1 \
--max-ttl 0
----
+
The `max-ttl` parameter is set at `0`, which indicates that no expiration time is applied to the new collection (this being the default &#8212; for information on expiration, see xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration]).
+
On success, the output is as follows:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Create the `my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_2` collection:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection my_scope.my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
On success, the output is as again follows:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Now, list all collections:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-collections my_scope
----
+
If the command is successful, the output features a list of all created collections within `my_scope`:
+
----
Scope my_scope:
    - my_collection_in_my_scope_2
    - my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
The output indicates that `my_scope` now contains the collections `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` and `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`.

. Create a collection in the `_default` scope, and then list collections within that scope.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--create-collection _default.my_collection_in_default_scope
----
+
The argument to the `create-collection` parameter thus specifies a new collection, `my_collection_in_default_scope`, to be created in the `_default` scope.
(Note, however that, as a convenience for the CLI-user, this notation can be shortened; by simply omitting explicit reference to the `_default` scope, and preceding the name of the new collection with the dot alone: thus, the argument to `create-collection` is shortened to `.my_collection_in_default_scope`.)
+
On success, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Collection created
----
+
Now, list collections within the scope:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli collection-manage -c localhost \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--list-collections _default
----
+
On success, a list of the collections in the scope is displayed:
+
----
Scope _default:
    - my_collection_in_default_scope
    - _default
----
+
The output indicates that the `_default` scope now contains two collections, which are the `_default` collection, and the newly created collection `my_collection_in_default_scope`.

. Create two documents, within the collection `my_collection_in_my_scope_1`, using the `cbc create` command.
Scope and collection are respectively specified with the `--scope` and `--collection` flags (note that if no scope or collection is explicitly specified, the default scope or collection is assumed).
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc create \
-u Administrator -P password testDocument1 \
-U couchbase://localhost/testBucket \
--scope='my_scope' \
--collection='my_collection_in_my_scope_1' \
-V '{"key1" : "value1"}'
----
+
On success, this produces output indicating that the named document has been saved, and providing its _CAS_ number.
+
----
testDocument1        Stored. CAS=0x1668d67ee31b0000
                     SYNCTOKEN=816,47341375326027,5
----
+
Now, create the second document:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbc create -u Administrator -P password testDocument2 \
-U couchbase://localhost/testBucket \
--scope='my_scope' \
--collection='my_collection_in_my_scope_1' \
-V '{"key2" : "value2"}'
----
+
On success, the output is as follows:
+
----
testDocument2        Stored. CAS=0x1668d68983750000
                     SYNCTOKEN=569,122315102163226,5
----

. Display statistics on existing collections, using the `cbstats` command, specifying the collections parameter.
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 collections
----
+
Statistics are displayed as follows:

[#manage-scopes-and-collections-with-the-rest-api]
== Manage Scopes and Collections with the REST API

The following sequence of REST API commands demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections.
Proceed as follows:

At the command-line prompt, proceed as follows:

. Create a bucket, named `testBucket`, using the `/pools/default/buckets` REST method:
+
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-d name=testBucket \
-d ramQuotaMB=100
----
+
For information on this REST call and its parameters, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

. Create a scope. This is a POST operation, using the `/pools/default/buckets/_<bucket>_/scopes` endpoint, and specifying the `-name` parameter.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes \
-d name=my_scope
----
+
If successful, the command returns a _uid_ for the action (this is principally for internal use, and need not be tracked by the user):
+
----
{"uid":1}
----
+
Now, examine the collections _manifest_ for the specified bucket.
This is a GET operation, using the `/pools/default/buckets/_<bucket>_/scopes` endpoint.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes
----
+
This returns the following output:
+
----
{"uid":"1","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0","maxTTL":0}]}]}
----
+
Formatted, this output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "1",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": []
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",

          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    }

}

This output shows that the bucket now contains two scopes, which are `my_scope` and `_default`.
The `_default` scope contains a single collection, which is also named `_default`.
The `maxTTL` for the collection is `0`, which means that by default, no expiration time has been applied to this collection.
(For information on expiration, see xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration]).

. Create two collections, within the created scope.
This requires a POST operation, specifying the created scope as a path parameter, and using the -name parameter to specify the new collection-name.
For the first collection, enter the following command:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes/my_scope/collections \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_1 \
-d maxTTL=0
----
+
The `maxTTL` parameter thus establishes that there is no expiration time applied to the new collection (which is, in fact, the default).
If successful, the operation returns a uid.
+
----
{"uid":2}
----
+
Create the second collection as follows:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes/my_scope/collections \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
Again, success returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":3}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes
----
+
The unformatted output is as follows:
+
----
{"uid":"3","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9","maxTTL":0},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8","maxTTL":0}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0","maxTTL":0}]}]}
----
+
When formatted, the output takes the following appearance:
+
----
{
  "uid": "3",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9",
          "maxTTL": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that the collections `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` and `my_collection_in_my_scope_2` have been successfully created in `my_scope`.

. Create a collection in the default scope.
This is a POST operation, specifying the `_default` scope as a path parameter, and the `-name` parameter to specify the new collection-name.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes/_default/collections \
-d name=my_collection_in_default_scope
----
+
A uid is returned:
+
----
{"uid":4}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes
----
+
This returns the following:
+
----
{"uid":"4","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9","maxTTL":0},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8","maxTTL":0}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_default_scope","uid":"a","maxTTL":0},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","maxTTL":0}]}]}
----
+
When formatted the output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "4",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9",
          "maxTTL": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a",
          "maxTTL": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that the collection `my_collection_in_default_scope` has been successfully created in the `_default` scope, and so appears alongside the `_default` collection.

. Drop a collection from the created scope.
This requires a DELETE operation, and the endpoint that specifies the collection that is to be dropped.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X DELETE \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes/my_scope/\
collections/my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
This returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":5}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes
----
+
The output (here formatted) indicates that the collection `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` has successfully been dropped from `my_scope`:
+
----
{
  "uid": "5",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a",
          "maxTTL": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

. Drop the created scope, and examine the manifest.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X DELETE \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes/my_scope
----
+
This returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":6}
----
+
Examine the manifest:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes
----
+
The output (here formatted) is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "6",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a",
          "maxTTL": 0
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0",
          "maxTTL": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that `my_scope`  has successfully been dropped; and with it, the collection `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`.

This concludes the sequence of commands.
