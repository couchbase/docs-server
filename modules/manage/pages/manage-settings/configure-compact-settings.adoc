[#understanding-auto-compaction]
== Understanding Auto-Compaction

Auto-Compaction is enabled by default for all Couchbase buckets.
However, settings can be overridden on a per bucket basis.

Auto-compaction settings affect _on-disk_ data, and therefore do not apply to Ephemeral buckets.

Full and Cluster administrators can configure compaction settings with xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc#configure-auto-compaction-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc#configure-auto-compaction-with-the-cli[CLI], or the xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc#configure-auto-compaction-with-the-rest-api[REST] API.

Note that in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, auto-compaction does not apply to memory-optimized index storage, and there are no settings necessary for configuring the auto-compaction of Global Secondary Indexes using standard index storage.
However, for installations of Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition running on Linux, note that hole punching is required to enable auto-compaction of Global Secondary Indexes using standard index storage.
See xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#standard-index-storage[Standard Index Storage], for information.

[#configure-auto-compaction-with-the-ui]
== Configure Auto-Compaction with the UI

Instructions on accessing Auto-Compaction settings are provided below.

[#for-a-new-bucket]
=== For a New Bucket

To access the auto-compaction settings-panel for an new, individual bucket, proceed as follows:

. Access the *Buckets* screen provided by the Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *ADD BUCKET* tab:
+
[#add-bucket-button]
image::manage-settings/addBucketButton.png[,100,align=left]

. When the *Add Data Bucket* dialog appears, add appropriate data into the initial fields; then left-click on the [.ui]*Advanced bucket settings* tab:
+
[#show_advanced_settings]
image::manage-settings/show-advanced-settings.png[,360,align=left]
+
The dialog now expands, and displays additional configuration-options.

. Access the [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* panel, and check the [.ui]*Override the default auto-compaction settings?* checkbox:
+
[#override_default_auto_compaction]
image::manage-settings/override-default-auto-compaction.png[,370,align=left]
+
The dialog expands again, and displays Auto-Compaction settings available for this bucket.

[#for-an-existing-bucket]
=== For an Existing Bucket

To access the auto-compaction settings-panel for an individual, existing bucket, proceed as follows:

. Left-click on the information-row for the bucket, on the *Buckets* screen of Couchbase Web Console.
When the *Edit* button appears, left-click on it:
+
[#edit-bucket-definition-button]
image::manage-settings/edit-bucket-definition-button.png[,300,align=left]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*Edit Bucket Settings* dialog.

. Left-click on the [.ui]*Show advanced bucket settings* tab.

. Access the [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* panel, and check the [.ui]*Override the default auto-compaction settings?* checkbox.
The dialog expands, thereby showing the available Auto-Compaction settings.

[#for-no-override-buckets]
=== To Establish Defaults for All Buckets

To access the auto-compaction settings-screen that provides defaults for all buckets not otherwise assigned customized settings, proceed as follows:

. Left-click on the [.ui]*Settings* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar at the left-hand side.

. When the [.ui]*Settings* screen appears, left-click on the [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* tab, on the horizontal control-bar at the top:
+
[#auto_compaction_tab]
image::manage-settings//auto-compaction-tab.png[,360,align=left]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* screen.

=== Establishing Auto-Compaction Settings

The [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* view of the [.ui]*Settings* screen appears as follows.
(Note that the [.ui]*Index Fragmentation* settings are only displayed for Couchbase Server Community Edition.)

[#auto_compact_defaultNewUI]
image::manage-settings/auto-compact-defaultNewUI.png[,820,align=left]

All settings on this screen are also provided on the dialogs whereby you establish custom-settings for an individual new or existing bucket -- with the exception of the settings for <<index-fragmentation>>, which can only be established on a cluster-wide basis.

Settings constitute _conditions_, which must be met for the compaction-process to be triggered.
The settings are described below.

[#database-fragmentation]
=== Database Fragmentation

The [.ui]*Database Fragmentation* panel appears as follows:

[#database_fragmentationNewUI]
image::manage-settings/database-fragmentationNewUI.png[,420,align=left]

Compaction is triggered when database-fragmentation reaches the point specified by means of this interface.
You can specify the fragmentation-level as a percentage (the upper field, selected by checking the adjacent checkbox); or as a number of megabytes (the lower).

[#view-fragmentation]
=== View Fragmentation

The [.ui]*View Fragmentation* panel appears as follows:

[#view_fragmentation_interface]
image::manage-settings/view-fragmentation-interface.png[,420,align=left]

Compaction is triggered when view-fragmentation reaches the point specified by means of this interface.
You can specify the fragmentation-level as a percentage (the upper field, selected by checking the adjacent checkbox); or as a number of megabytes (the lower).

[#time-interval]
=== Time Interval

The [.ui]*Time Interval* pane provides a number of settings whereby compaction is scheduled:

[#time_interval_interface]
image::manage-settings/time-interval-interface.png[,420,align=left]

To set a time-interval during which compaction is permitted to run, check the checkbox at the top of the pane.
Then, add a start and an end time into the interactive fields.
Note that each left-hand field specifies the hour-of-the-day; while each right-hand specifies the minute-of-the-hour.

Checkboxes are provided to allow you to specify: first, that compaction can be aborted if the specified time is exceeded; secondly, that database and view compaction are executed simultaneously (implying a heavier processing and disk I/O load, during the compaction-process).

For example, the following, completed [.ui]*Time Interval* pane specifies that compaction should run between 1:00 am and 2:30 am; should be aborted if not completed in time; and should feature parallel compaction of database and indexes:

[#time_interval_interface_completed]
image::manage-settings/time-interval-interface-completed.png[,310,align=left]

[#index-fragmentation]
=== Index Fragmentation

The [.ui]*Index Fragmentation* panel, which is only available in Couchbase Server Community Edition, provides settings that cannot be overridden at individual bucket-level.
The panel appears as follows:

[#index_fragmentation]
image::manage-settings/index-fragmentation.png[,520,align=left]

This interface sets the write-strategy and trigger-point for compaction.

Select from the following options:

* *Append-only write mode with index fragmentation level trigger*.
Turns on _append only_ writes for index-storage, and triggers the compaction-job based on the fragmentation-level of each index file.
Check the checkbox, then specify a fragmentation-level as a percentage, in the interactive text-field.

* *Circular write mode with day + time interval trigger*.
Turns on writes with _circular reuse_ for index-storage, and triggers the compaction-job based on a time-interval.
To specify when compaction is permitted to run, select appropriate _days of the week_, by checking the appropriate checkboxes; then, select the start-time on each of those days; and optionally, an end-time.
+
Optionally, check the [.ui]*Abort compaction if run time exceeds the set time interval* checkbox: if you do so, compaction is aborted if the specified end-time is exceeded.

Note that whenever you change the compaction settings for the index, the system starts the global secondary index process on all the nodes.

See xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#standard-index-storage[Standard Index Storage] for information on append-only and circular write modes.

[#tombstone-purge-interval]
=== Metadata Purge Interval

Sets the frequency of the metadata (or _tombstone_) purge interval, for _Couchbase_ buckets only.
The default value is three days.

The panel appears as follows:

[#meta_data_purge_interface]
image::manage-settings/meta-data-purge-interface.png[,240,align=left]

_Tombstones_ are records of expired or deleted items.
They include key and metadata.
Tombstones are used in Couchbase Server to provide eventual consistency of data between clusters.
The specified number of days will elapse before tombstones for expired or deleted items are _permanently_ removed.
The default value is three days.
The permitted range of values is `0.04` to `60` (where `0.04` equals one hour, and `1` equals one day.

[CAUTION]
====
If you set this value too low, you may see inconsistent results in Views queries, such as deleted items appearing in a result set.
You may also see inconsistent items across clusters, if XDCR has been set up between the clusters.

If the metadata purge interval is set too low, it can also cause severe issues with transactions, especially for ephemeral buckets.

If you set this value too high, it delays Couchbase Server from reclaiming disk space.
====

The *Metadata Purge Interval* panel on this screen establishes a default purge interval for _Couchbase buckets only_.
Therefore:

* If a Couchbase bucket is left at its default setting, any change made here to the default value duly changes the frequency of metadata purges for that bucket.

* If a Couchbase bucket has already been given a customized setting, no change made here to the default value has any effect on the frequency of metadata purges for that bucket.
For information on providing customized settings, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket] and xref:manage:manage-buckets/edit-bucket.adoc[Edit a Bucket].

* Neither the default nor the customized frequency of metadata purges for any Ephemeral bucket is affected by changes made here.
Note that although the default interval for Ephemeral buckets is, as with Couchbase buckets, `3`, only _per bucket_ interval-changes can be made, for Ephemeral buckets: the default interval for Ephemeral buckets cannot be changed globally.

For more information, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc[Storage Settings].

[#configure-auto-compaction-with-the-cli]
== Configure Auto-Compaction with the CLI

To configure auto-compaction with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-compaction.adoc[setting-compaction] command.

This example establishes fragmentation thresholds and sizes for database and view, and specifies the time-period during which compaction should occur.
It specifies that compaction be aborted if it should overrun this time-period.
Parallel compaction for database and view is switched _off_.
The tombstone purge interval is set to 3 days; and _circular_ standard compaction is specified for particular days and hours.

See xref:rest-api:rest-autocompact-set.adoc[Setting Auto-Compaction], for more information.
