[abstract]
_General_ settings allow configuration of _cluster name_, _memory quotas_, _storage modes_, and _node availability_ for the cluster; and of _advanced settings_ for the Index and Query Services.

[#configuring-general-settings-examples-on-this-page]
== Examples on This Page

Full and Cluster Administrators can configure general settings by means of xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#configure-general-settings-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#configure-general-settings-with-the-cli[CLI], or the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-ui]
== Configure General Settings with the UI

The appearance of the *General* screen is as follows:

image::manage-settings/general-settings.png[,720,align=left]

The panels and their UI elements are described below.

[#cluster-name]
=== Cluster Name

The *Cluster Name* is the name that was given during initial setup.
This name can be changed at any time.

[#memory-quotas]
=== Memory Quotas

The amount of memory available to each service, on every node.
The combination of assigned values is not permitted to exceed the total memory available on the most memory-constrained node.

* *Data Service*.
The memory allocation for the Data Service, per node.
The minimum allocation must be equal to or greater than the sum of all per bucket memory-allocations on the node.

* *Index Service*.
The buffer cache size for the Index Service.
The specified amount of memory is pre-allocated as soon as the Index Service starts up.
It is then shared with all indexes created on the node.
The total memory-usage of the indexer process will be the buffer cache size plus the size of various internal data structures and queues.

* *Search Service*.
The memory allocation for the Search Service, per node.

* *Analytics Service*.
The memory allocation for the Analytics Service, per node.

* *Eventing Service*.
The memory allocation for the Eventing Service, per node.

Note that the *Query Service* requires no memory allocation.

[#current-version]
=== Current Version

This panel displays the current version of Couchbase Server, and indicates whether updates are available.
The *Enable Software Update Notifications* checkbox is checked by default.
If the checkbox is checked, Couchbase Web Console provides notifications whenever a new version of Couchbase Server is available.
Configuration-information transferred in the update-check is anonymous, and does not include any stored key-value data.

[#node-availability]
=== Node Availability

The options in the *Node Availability* panel control whether and how *Automatic Failover* is applied.
For detailed information on policy and constraints, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].

The following checkboxes are provided:

* *Enable auto-failover after _x_ seconds for up to _y_ event*: After the timeout period set here as _x_ seconds has elapsed, an unresponsive or malfunctioning node is failed over, provided that the limit on actionable events set here as _y_ has not yet been reached.
Data replicas are promoted to active on other nodes, as appropriate.
This feature can only be used when three or more nodes are present in the cluster.
The number of seconds to elapse is configurable: the default is 120; the minimum permitted is 5; the maximum 3600.
This option is selected by default.
* *Enable auto-failover for sustained data disk read/write failures after _z_ seconds*: After the timeout period set here as _z_ seconds has elapsed, a node is failed over if it has experienced sustained data disk read/write failures.
The timeout period is configurable: the default length is 120 seconds; the minimum permitted is 5; the maximum 3600.
This checkbox can only be checked if *Enable auto-failover after* _x_ *seconds for up to* _y_ *event* has also been checked.
* *Enable auto-failover of server groups*: Server-group failover is enabled.
This checkbox (which can only be checked if *Enable auto-failover after _x_ seconds for up to _y_ event* has also been checked) should only be checked if three or more server groups have been established, and capacity is available to absorb the combined load of all potentially failed-over groups.
For information on groups, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server Group Awareness].
* *Can abort rebalance*. Whether a rebalance, in progress at the time the node become unresponsive, can be aborted; in order to perform the auto-failover.
This option is selected by default.

The *Node Availability* panel also contains an *Enable auto-reprovisioning* option, for Ephemeral buckets.
Checking this checkbox ensures that if a node containing _active_ Ephemeral buckets becomes unavailable, its replicas on the specified number of other nodes are promoted to active status as appropriate, to avoid data-loss.
Note, however, that this may leave the cluster in an unbalanced state, requiring a rebalance.

[#index-storage-mode]
=== Index Storage Mode

This section provides radio buttons whereby the storage mode for indexes can be selected.
The options are xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#memory-optimized-index-storage[Memory Optimized Index Storage], and xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#standard-index-storage[Standard Index Storage].

*Advanced Settings* for indexes are also provided:

* *Indexer Threads*.
The number of dedicated threads used by the Index Service.
The number can be increased on multi-core machines.
The default is 0.

* *Max Rollback Points*.
The maximum number of committed rollback points.
The default is 5.

* *Indexer Log Level*.
Adjust the logging level.
The options are: `Silent`, `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Verbose`, `Timing`, `Debug`, and `Trace`.
The default is `Info`.

[#query-settings]
=== Query Settings

Specify either *Unrestricted* or *Restricted*, to determine which URLs are permitted to be accessed by the `curl` function.
If *Unrestricted* (the default) is specified, all URLs can be accessed.
If *Restricted* is specified, the UI expands, to display configurable fields into which the URLs allowed and disallowed can be entered.

The *Query Temp Disk Path* field allows specification of the path to which temporary files are written, based on query activities.
The maximum size of the target can be specified, in megabytes.

[#saving-settings]
=== Saving Settings
To save settings, left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower right.

image::manage-settings/save-or-cancel.png[,220,align=left]

Alternatively, cancel recently entered values, and thereby reset to previous values; by left-clicking on *Cancel/Reset*.

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-cli]
== Configure General Settings with the CLI

To configure _name and memory_, _index storage_, and _auto-failover_ via CLI, use the appropriate CLI command; as described below.
Note that no CLI support is provided for configuring _query settings_.
As an alternative, see xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api[Configure General Settings with the REST API], below.
Additionally, for information on URL whitelisting via the N1QL `CURL()` function, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/curl.adoc[CURL Function].

[#name-and-memory-settings-via-cli]
=== Name and Memory Settings via CLI

Name and memory settings are established with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-cluster.adoc[setting-index] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-cluster \
--cluster 10.143.192.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--cluster-ramsize 256 \
--cluster-name 10.143.192.101 \
--cluster-index-ramsize 256 \
--cluster-fts-ramsize 512 \
--cluster-eventing-ramsize 256 \
--cluster-analytics-ramsize 1024
----

This establishes the cluster-name as `10.143.192.101`, the memory allocation for Data and Index Services each as 256 megabytes, and the memory allocation for each other service as zero.

If successful, the call produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Cluster settings modified
----

Note that settings for an individual server may be retrieved with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-server-info.adoc[server-info] command, the output for which can be filtered, as appropriate, by `grep`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli server-info \
-c 10.143.192.101 -u Administrator -p password | grep fts
----
This returns the setting for `ftsMemoryQuota`:

----
"ftsMemoryQuota": 512,
----

[#index-storage-settings-via-cli]
=== Index Storage Settings via CLI

Index storage can be configured with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-index.adoc[setting-index] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-index \
-c 10.143.192.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--index-log-level info \
--index-stable-snapshot-interval 40000 \
--index-memory-snapshot-interval 150 \
--index-storage-setting default \
--index-threads 8 \
--index-max-rollback-points 10
----
This establishes the logging level as `info`, the stable snapshot interval at 40 seconds, the memory snapshot at 150 milliseconds, and the storage setting as `default` (which means _standard_, rather than _memory optimized_).
The number of threads to be used is established as 8, and the maximum number of rollback points to 10.
For information on the significance of these values see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-index.adoc[setting-index].

If successful, the call produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Indexer settings modified
----

[#software-update-settings-via-cli]
=== Software-Update Settings via CLI

Software update-notifications can be configured by means of the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-notification.adoc[setting-notification] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-notification \
-c 10.143.192.101 -u Administrator -p password \
--enable-notifications 1
----

A value of 1 for `--enable-notifications` enables update-notifications. A value of 0 disables.
If successful, the command produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Notification settings updated
----

[#auto-failover-settings-via-cli]
=== Auto-Failover Settings via CLI

Auto-failover can be configured with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-autofailover.adoc[setting-autofailover] command.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-autofailover \
-c 10.143.192.101:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable-auto-failover 1 \
--auto-failover-timeout 120 \
--enable-failover-of-server-groups 1 \
--max-failovers 2 \
--can-abort-rebalance 1
----

This enables auto-failover, with a timeout of 120 seconds, and an event-maximum of 2.
It also enables failover server groups, and specifies, by means of the `--can-abort-rebalance` flag, that if a node becomes unresponsive during a rebalance, that node can be failed over automatically, and the rebalance thereby aborted.

If successful, the command returns the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----

For a detailed description of auto-failover settings, policy, and constraints, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api]
== Configure General Settings with the REST API

Multiple REST API methods are provided to support configuration of general settings.
These are described below.

[#name-and-memory-settings-via-rest]
=== Name and Memory Settings via REST

To establish name and memory settings, use the `/pools/default` method.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default \
-d clusterName=10.143.192.101 \
-d memoryQuota=256 \
-d indexMemoryQuota=256 \
-d ftsMemoryQuota=256 \
-d cbasMemoryQuota=1024 \
-d eventingMemoryQuota=512
----

This establishes the cluster's IP address as its name, and assigns memory-quotas to the Data, Index, Search, Analytics, and Eventing Services.

Note that when used with GET, `/pools/default` returns configuration-settings.
The output can be filtered, by means of a tool such as `jq`:

----
curl -s -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.ftsMemoryQuota'
----

If successful, this returns the value of the key `ftsMemoryQuota`:

----
256
----

[#software-update-settings-via-rest]
=== Software-Update Settings via REST

Software update-notifications can be configured by means of the `/setting/stats` command.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/stats \
-d sendStats=true
----

This establishes that software-update notifications should be send.
To prevent the sending of notifications, set the value of `sendStats` to `false`.

[#node-availability-settings-via-rest]
=== Node Availability Settings via REST

To establish node availability settings, use the `/settings/autoFailover` method.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/autoFailover \
-d enabled=true \
-d timeout=120 \
-d failoverOnDataDiskIssues[enabled]=false \
-d failoverOnDataDiskIssues[timePeriod]=120 \
-d failoverServerGroup=true \
-d maxCount=2 \
-d canAbortRebalance=true
----

This enables auto-failover, with a timeout of 120 seconds, and a maximum failover-count of 2.
It also specifies, by means of `canAbortRebalance`, that if a node becomes unresponsive during a rebalance, that node can be failed over automatically, and the rebalance thereby aborted.
Additionally, failover is enabled in the event of suboptimal disk responsiveness, with a time-period of 120 seconds specified.

For more information on these options, see the descriptions provided above, for the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#node-availability[UI].

Additionally, the `/settings/autoReprovision` method can be used; to specify that if a node containing _active_ Ephemeral buckets becomes unavailable, its replicas on the specified number of other nodes are promoted to active status as appropriate, to avoid data-loss.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/autoReprovision \
-d enabled=true \
-d maxNodes=1
----

This enables auto-reprovisioning, specifying 1 as the maximum number of nodes.

[#index-settings-via-rest]
=== Index Settings via REST

To establish index settings, use the `/settings/indexes` method.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/indexes \
-d indexerThreads=4 \
-d logLevel=verbose \
-d maxRollbackPoints=10 \
-d storageMode=memory_optimized \
-d memorySnapshotInterval=150 \
-d stableSnapshotInterval=40000
----

This establishes the storage mode for indexes as `memory_optimized`. It also establishes a `verbose` logging level, and a total of 4 index threads.
For detailed information on these and other settings, see the REST reference page for the method, at xref:rest-api:post-settings-indexes.adoc[Set GSI Settings].

If successful, the call returns a JSON object, which provides values for all current index settings:

----
{"storageMode":"memory_optimized","indexerThreads":4,"memorySnapshotInterval":150,"stableSnapshotInterval":40000,"maxRollbackPoints":10,"logLevel":"verbose"}
----

[#query-settings-via-rest]
=== Query Settings via REST

To set the directory for temporary query data, and establish its size-limit, use the `/settings/querySettings` method.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/querySettings \
-d queryTmpSpaceDir=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Ftmp \
-d queryTmpSpaceSize=5120
----

This specifies that the directory for temporary query data should be `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/tmp`; and that the maximum size should be 5120 megabytes.

If successful, this call returns a JSON document featuring all the current query-related settings, including access-control:

----
{"queryTmpSpaceDir":"/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/tmp","queryTmpSpaceSize":5120,"queryCurlWhitelist":{"all_access":false}}
----

The document's values indicate that the specified values for directory and size have been established; and that the current setting for access-control restricts access to all, with no exceptions.

To specify particular URLs as allowed and disallowed, use the `/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist` method:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist \
-d '{"all_access":false,"allowed_urls":["https://company1.com"],"disallowed_urls":["https://company2.com"]}'
----

A JSON document is specified as the payload for the method.
The document's values indicate that `https://company1.com` is allowed, and `https://company2.com` is disallowed.

If successful, the call returns a JSON document that confirms the modified settings:

----
{"all_access":false,"allowed_urls":["https://company1.com"],"disallowed_urls":["https://company2.com"]}
----
