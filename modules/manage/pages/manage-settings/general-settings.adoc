:page-aliases: settings:cluster-settings,settings:change-failover-settings

[abstract]
_General_ settings allow configuration of _cluster name_, _memory quotas_, _storage modes_, and _node availability_ for the cluster; and of _advanced settings_ for the Index and Query Services.

[#configuring-general-settings-examples-on-this-page]
== Examples on This Page

Full and Cluster Administrators can configure general settings by means of <<configure-general-settings-with-the-ui,Couchbase Web Console>>, the <<configure-general-settings-with-the-cli,CLI>>, or the <<configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api,REST API>>.

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-ui]
== Configure General Settings with the UI

The appearance of the *General* screen is as follows:

image::manage-settings/general-settings.png[,720,align=left]

The panels and their UI elements are described below.

[#cluster-name]
=== Cluster Name

The *Cluster Name* is the name that was given during initial setup.
This name can be changed at any time.
The interactive field appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/cluster-name.png[,540,align=left]

[#memory-quotas]
=== Memory Quotas

The amount of memory available to each service, on every node.
The combination of assigned values is not permitted to exceed the total memory available on the most memory-constrained node.

The panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/memory-quotas.png[,540,align=left]

The displayed, configurable options are:

* *Data Service*.
The memory allocation for the Data Service, per node.
The minimum allocation must be equal to or greater than the sum of all per bucket memory-allocations on the node.

* *Index Service*.
The buffer cache size for the Index Service.
The specified amount of memory is pre-allocated as soon as the Index Service starts up.
It is then shared with all indexes created on the node.
The total memory-usage of the indexer process will be the buffer cache size plus the size of various internal data structures and queues.

* *Search Service*.
The memory allocation for the Search Service, per node.

* *Analytics Service*.
The memory allocation for the Analytics Service, per node.

* *Eventing Service*.
The memory allocation for the Eventing Service, per node.

Note that the *Query Service* requires no memory allocation.

[#current-version]
=== Current Version

This panel displays the current version of Couchbase Server, and can be used to indicate whether updates are available.
It appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/current-version.png[,540,align=left]

The *Enable Software Update Notifications* checkbox is checked by default.
If the checkbox is checked, Couchbase Web Console provides adjacent notifications whenever a new version of Couchbase Server is available; if the checkbox is unchecked, notifications are not provided.

If the checkbox is checked, Couchbase Web Console communicates with Couchbase Server to ascertain the following information, which is then transmitted to Couchbase:

* The server-version of the current installation.

* Information about data-size and performance.

* The cluster-configuration, including which services are deployed.

Note that data is transmitted to Couchbase from the browser accessing the web console, not from the cluster itself.
The update-notification process works anonymously: data cannot be tracked.
No identifiable information (such as bucket names, bucket data, design-document names, or hostnames) is transmitted.

[#node-availability]
=== Node Availability

The options in the *Node Availability* panel control whether and how *Automatic Failover* is applied.
For detailed information on policy and constraints, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].

The panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/node-availability.png[,540,align=left]

The following checkboxes are provided:

* *Enable auto-failover after _x_ seconds for up to _y_ event*: After the timeout period set here as _x_ seconds has elapsed, an unresponsive or malfunctioning node is failed over, provided that the limit on actionable events set here as _y_ has not yet been reached.
Data replicas are promoted to active on other nodes, as appropriate.
This feature can only be used when three or more nodes are present in the cluster.
The number of seconds to elapse is configurable: the default is 120; the minimum permitted is 5; the maximum 3600.
This option is selected by default.
* *Enable auto-failover for sustained data disk read/write failures after _z_ seconds*: After the timeout period set here as _z_ seconds has elapsed, a node is failed over if it has experienced sustained data disk read/write failures.
The timeout period is configurable: the default length is 120 seconds; the minimum permitted is 5; the maximum 3600.
This checkbox can only be checked if *Enable auto-failover after* _x_ *seconds for up to* _y_ *event* has also been checked.
* *Enable auto-failover of server groups*: Server-group failover is enabled.
This checkbox (which can only be checked if *Enable auto-failover after _x_ seconds for up to _y_ event* has also been checked) should only be checked if three or more server groups have been established, and capacity is available to absorb the combined load of all potentially failed-over groups.
For information on groups, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server Group Awareness].
* *Can abort rebalance*. Whether a rebalance, in progress at the time the node become unresponsive, can be aborted; in order to perform the auto-failover.
This option is selected by default.
For further information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc#auto-failover-during-rebalance[Auto-Failover During Rebalance].

The *Node Availability* panel also contains a *For Ephemeral Buckets* option.
When opened, this provides an *Enable auto-reprovisioning* checkbox, with a configurable number of nodes.
Checking this ensures that if a node containing _active_ Ephemeral buckets becomes unavailable, its replicas on the specified number of other nodes are promoted to active status as appropriate, to avoid data-loss.
Note, however, that this may leave the cluster in an unbalanced state, requiring a rebalance.

[#auto-failover-and-durability]
==== Auto-Failover and Durability

Couchbase Server provides _durability_, which ensures the greatest likelihood of data-writes surviving unexpected anomalies, such as node-outages.
The auto-failover maximum should be established to support guarantees of durability.
See xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability], for information.

[#rebalance-settings]
=== Rebalance Settings

_Rebalance_ redistributes data and indexes among available nodes.
For an overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc[Rebalance].
Fully open, the panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/rebalance-settings.png[,540,align=left]

The *Retry rebalance* option allows rebalance to be _retried_, in cases where it has failed.
Check the checkbox, to enable.
The specifiable, _maximum number of retries_ must be in the range of 1 to 3, inclusive.
The specifiable, _maximum number of seconds_ must be in the range of 5 to 3600, inclusive.

Note that this option should _not_ be enabled if the cluster is managed by _Couchbase Autonomous Operator_, or if custom scripts are already being used to trigger rebalance.
Note also that no administrative tasks should be attempted when rebalance-retries are pending.
However, pending rebalance-retries can be cancelled: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling], for information.

The *Max moves per node during rebalance* option establishes the maximum number of concurrent vBucket moves permitted on every individual node.
The minimum value for the parameter is `1`, the maximum `64`, the default `4`.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#limiting-concurrent-vbucket-moves[Limiting Concurrent vBucket Moves].

[#data-settings]
=== Data Settings

The settings in this area control the numbers of threads that are allocated _per node_ by Couchbase Server to the _reading_ and _writing_ of data, respectively.
The maximum thread-allocation to each is _64_, the minimum _4_.

A high thread-allocation may improve performance on systems whose hardware-resources are commensurately supportive (for example, where the number of CPU cores is high).
In particular, a high number of _writer_ threads on such systems may significantly optimize the performance of _durable writes_: see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability], for information.

Note, however, that a high thread-allocation might _impair_ some aspects of system-performance on less appropriately resourced nodes.
Consequently, changes to the default thread-allocation should not be made to production systems without prior testing.

Left-clicking on the *Advanced Data Settings* tab displays radio buttons for *Reader Thread Settings* and *Writer Thread Settings*:

image::manage-settings/data-settings.png[,540,align=left]

Each group has the same, three radio buttons, which are as follows:

* *Default*.
_Four_ threads are allocated.

* *Disk i/o optimized*.
The number of threads allocated is equal to the number of CPU cores for the node.

* *Fixed value*.
The number of threads allocated is equal to the value selected from the pull-down menu.

[#query-settings]
=== Query Settings

Left-clicking on the *Advanced Query Settings* tab displays interactive fields whereby the Query Service can be configured.
The top section of the panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/query-settings-top.png[,540,align=left]

Specify either *Unrestricted* or *Restricted*, to determine which URLs are permitted to be accessed by the `curl` function.
If *Unrestricted* (the default) is specified, all URLs can be accessed.
If *Restricted* is specified, the UI expands, to display configurable fields into which the URLs allowed and disallowed can be entered.

The *Query Temp Disk Path* field allows specification of the path to which temporary files are written, based on query activities.
The maximum size of the target can be specified, in megabytes.

Additional Query settings are provided in the lower section of the panel:

image::manage-settings/query-settings-bottom.png[,540,align=left]

* *Pipeline Batch*: The number of items that can be batched for fetches from the Data Service.

* *Pipeline Cap*: The maximum number of items that can be buffered in a fetch.

* *Scan Cap*: The maximum buffered channel size between the indexer client and the Query Service, for index scans.

* *Timeout*: The maximum time to spend on a request before timing out.

* *Prepared Limit*: The maximum number of prepared statements to be held in the cache.

* *Completed Limit*: The number of requests to be logged in the completed requests catalog.

* *Completed Threshold*: The completed-query duration (in millisconds) beyond which the query is logged in the completed requests catalog.

* *Log Level*: The log level used in the logger.

* *Max Parallelism*: The maximum number of index partitions for parallel aggregation-computing.

* *N1QL Feature Controller*: Provided for technical support only.

For additional details on all the Query settings in the lower section of the panel, see the N1QL xref:n1ql:n1ql-rest-api/admin.adoc#_settings[Admin REST API], for full details.

[#index-storage-mode]
=== Index Storage Mode

This panel provides radio buttons whereby the storage mode for indexes can be selected.
The panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/index-storage-mode.png[,540,align=left]

The options are xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#memory-optimized-index-storage[Memory Optimized Index Storage], and xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-modes.adoc#standard-index-storage[Standard Index Storage].

*Advanced Settings* for indexes are also provided:

* *Indexer Threads*.
The number of dedicated threads used by the Index Service.
The number can be increased on multi-core machines.
The default is 0.

* *Indexer Log Level*.
Adjust the logging level.
The options are: `Silent`, `Fatal`, `Error`, `Warn`, `Info`, `Verbose`, `Timing`, `Debug`, and `Trace`.
The default is `Info`.

[#xdcr-maximum-processes]
=== XDCR Maximum Processes

The maximum number of threads used per node, to support XDCR.
A greater number of threads increases parallelism, and may thereby produce enhanced XDCR performance.
The default number of threads is 4.

The panel appears as follows:

image::manage-settings/xdcr-maximum-processes.png[,540,align=left]

[#saving-settings]
=== Saving Settings
To save settings, left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower left.

image::manage-settings/save-or-cancel.png[,220,align=left]

Alternatively, cancel recently entered values, and thereby reset to previous values; by left-clicking on *Cancel/Reset*.

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-cli]
== Configure General Settings with the CLI

To configure _name and memory_, _index storage_, and _auto-failover_ via CLI, use the appropriate CLI command; as described below.
Note that no CLI support is provided for configuring _query settings_.
As an alternative, see <<configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api,Configure General Settings with the REST API>>, below.
Additionally, for information on URL access lists via the N1QL `CURL()` function, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/curl.adoc[CURL Function].

[#name-and-memory-settings-via-cli]
=== Name and Memory Settings via CLI

Name and memory settings are established with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-cluster.adoc[setting-cluster] command.

[source,shell]
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-cluster \
--cluster 10.143.192.101:8091 \

--cluster-fts-ramsize 512 \
--cluster-eventing-ramsize 256 \
--cluster-analytics-ramsize 1024
----

This establishes the cluster-name as `10.143.192.101`, the memory allocation for Data and Index Services each as 256 megabytes, and the memory allocation for each other service as zero.

If successful, the call produces the following output:

[source,shell]
----
SUCCESS: Cluster settings modified
----

Note that settings for an individual server may be retrieved with the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-server-info.adoc[server-info] command, the output for which can be filtered, as appropriate, by `grep`:

[source,shell]
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli server-info \

----

This enables auto-failover, with a timeout of 120 seconds, and an event-maximum of 2.
It also enables failover server groups, and specifies, by means of the `--can-abort-rebalance` flag, that if a node becomes unresponsive during a rebalance, that node can be failed over automatically, and the rebalance thereby aborted.

If successful, the command returns the following output:

[source,shell]
----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----

For a detailed description of auto-failover settings, policy, and constraints, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/automatic-failover.adoc[Automatic Failover].

[#rebalance-settings-via-cli]
=== Rebalance Settings via CLI

To obtain the cluster's current rebalance settings by means of the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-rebalance.adoc[setting-rebalance] command, with the `--get` option:

[#configure-general-settings-with-the-rest-api]
== Configure General Settings with the REST API

Multiple REST API methods are provided to support configuration of general settings.
These are described below.

[#name-and-memory-settings-via-rest]
=== Name and Memory Settings via REST

To establish name and memory settings, use the `/pools/default` method.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default \
-d clusterName=10.143.192.101 \
-d memoryQuota=256 \
-d indexMemoryQuota=256 \
-d ftsMemoryQuota=256 \
-d cbasMemoryQuota=1024 \
-d eventingMemoryQuota=512
----

This establishes the cluster's IP address as its name, and assigns memory-quotas to the Data, Index, Search, Analytics, and Eventing Services.

Note that when used with GET, `/pools/default` returns configuration-settings.
The output can be filtered, by means of a tool such as `jq`:

[source,shell]
----
curl -s -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.ftsMemoryQuota'
----

If successful, this returns the value of the key `ftsMemoryQuota`:

[source,shell]
----
256
----

[#software-update-settings-via-rest]
=== Software-Update Settings via REST

Software update-notifications can be configured by means of the `/setting/stats` command.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/stats \
-d sendStats=true
----

This establishes that software-update notifications should be send.
To prevent the sending of notifications, set the value of `sendStats` to `false`.

[#node-availability-settings-via-rest]
=== Node Availability Settings via REST

To establish node availability settings, use the `/settings/autoFailover` method.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/autoFailover \
-d enabled=true \
-d timeout=120 \
-d failoverOnDataDiskIssues[enabled]=false \
-d failoverOnDataDiskIssues[timePeriod]=120 \
-d failoverServerGroup=true \
-d maxCount=2 \
-d canAbortRebalance=true
----

This enables auto-failover, with a timeout of 120 seconds, and a maximum failover-count of 2.
It also specifies, by means of `canAbortRebalance`, that if a node becomes unresponsive during a rebalance, that node can be failed over automatically, and the rebalance thereby aborted.
Additionally, failover is enabled in the event of suboptimal disk responsiveness, with a time-period of 120 seconds specified.

For more information on these options, see the descriptions provided above, for the <<node-availability,UI>>.

Additionally, the `/settings/autoReprovision` method can be used; to specify that if a node containing _active_ Ephemeral buckets becomes unavailable, its replicas on the specified number of other nodes are promoted to active status as appropriate, to avoid data-loss.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/autoReprovision \
-d enabled=true \
-d maxNodes=1
----

This enables auto-reprovisioning, specifying 1 as the maximum number of nodes.

[#index-settings-via-rest]
=== Index Settings via REST

To establish index settings, use the `/settings/indexes` method.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/indexes \
-d indexerThreads=4 \
-d logLevel=verbose \
-d maxRollbackPoints=10 \
-d storageMode=memory_optimized \
-d memorySnapshotInterval=150 \
-d stableSnapshotInterval=40000
----

This establishes the storage mode for indexes as `memory_optimized`. It also establishes a `verbose` logging level, and a total of 4 index threads.
For detailed information on these and other settings, see the REST reference page for the method, at xref:rest-api:post-settings-indexes.adoc[Set GSI Settings].

If successful, the call returns a JSON object, which provides values for all current index settings:

[source,shell]
----
{"storageMode":"memory_optimized","indexerThreads":4,"memorySnapshotInterval":150,"stableSnapshotInterval":40000,"maxRollbackPoints":10,"logLevel":"verbose"}
----

[#data-settings-via-rest]
=== Data Settings via REST

To set the number of reader and writer threads for Couchbase Server, use the `POST /pools/default/settings/memcached/global` HTTP method and endpoint, as follows:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global \
-d num_reader_threads=12 \
-d num_writer_threads=8
----

This sets the number of _reader_ threads to `12`, and the number of _writer_ threads to `8`.
If successful, the call returns an object whose values confirm the settings that have been made:

[source,shell]
----
{"num_reader_threads":12,"num_writer_threads":8}
----

See xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc#threading[Threading] for an overview of reader and writer threads.
Also see the REST API reference page, xref:rest-api:rest-reader-writer-thread-config.adoc[Setting Thread Allocations].

[#query-settings-via-rest]
=== Query Settings via REST

To set the directory for temporary query data, and establish its size-limit, use the `/settings/querySettings` method.

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/querySettings \
-d queryTmpSpaceDir=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Ftmp \
-d queryTmpSpaceSize=5120
----

For additional information, see xref:rest-api:rest-reader-writer-thread-config.adoc[Setting Thread Allocations].

This specifies that the directory for temporary query data should be `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/tmp`; and that the maximum size should be 5120 megabytes.

If successful, this call returns a JSON document featuring all the current query-related settings, including access-control:

[source,shell]
----
{"queryTmpSpaceDir":"/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/tmp","queryTmpSpaceSize":5120,"queryCurlWhitelist":{"all_access":false}}
----

The document's values indicate that the specified values for directory and size have been established; and that the current setting for access-control restricts access to all, with no exceptions.

To specify particular URLs as allowed and disallowed, use the `/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist` method:

[source,shell]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/querySettings/curlWhitelist \
-d '{"all_access":false,"allowed_urls":["https://company1.com"],"disallowed_urls":["https://company2.com"]}'
----

A JSON document is specified as the payload for the method.
The document's values indicate that `https://company1.com` is allowed, and `https://company2.com` is disallowed.

If successful, the call returns a JSON document that confirms the modified settings:

[source,shell]
----
{"all_access":false,"allowed_urls":["https://company1.com"],"disallowed_urls":["https://company2.com"]}
----

[#rebalance-settings-via-rest]
=== Rebalance Settings via REST

By means of the REST API, both _rebalance retries_ and _maximum concurrent moves per node_ can be configured.

==== Rebalance Retries via REST

To obtain the cluster's current settings for _rebalance retries_ by means of the REST API, use the `GET /settings/retryRebalance` HTTP method and URI, as follows:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/retryRebalance
----

If successful, the command returns the following object:

[source,shell]
----
{"enabled":true,"afterTimePeriod":200,"maxAttempts":3}
----

This output shows that rebalance retry is enabled, with `200` seconds required to elapse before a retry is attempted, and a maximum of `3` retries possible.

To change the rebalance settings, use the `POST` method with the same URI, specifying appropriate values:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/retryRebalance \
-d enabled=false \
-d afterTimePeriod=100 \
-d maxAttempts=2
----

If successful, the command returns the following object:

[source,shell]
----
{"enabled":false,"afterTimePeriod":100,"maxAttempts":2}
----

This verifies that rebalance retry has been disabled, the required period between retries changed to `100` seconds, and the maximum number of retries changed to `2`.

For more information on getting and setting the rebalance retry status, see xref:rest-api:rest-configure-rebalance-retry.adoc[Configure Rebalance Retries], xref:rest-api:rest-get-rebalance-retry.adoc[Get Rebalance-Retry Status], and xref:rest-api:rest-cancel-rebalance-retry.adoc[Cancel Rebalance Retries].

==== Maximum Concurent vBucket Moves via REST

To inspect the current maximum number of concurrent vBucket moves permitted for every node, use the `GET /settings/rebalance` HTTP method and URI, with the `rebalanceMovesPerNode` parameter, as follows:

----
curl -v -X GET http://10.143.201.101:8091/settings/rebalance \
-u Administrator:password
----

This returns an object, confirming the current setting as being `4` (which is the default value):

----
{"rebalanceMovesPerNode":4}
----

To _set_ a new value for the parameter use the `POST` method with the same URI, and with the `rebalanceMovesPerNode` parameter.
Note that the minimum value is `1`, and the maximum `64`.

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/settings/rebalance \
-u Administrator:password \
-d rebalanceMovesPerNode=10
----

If successful, the call returns an object confirming the new setting:

----
{"rebalanceMovesPerNode":10}

[#xdcr-process-setting-via-rest]
=== XDCR Process Setting via REST

To determine how many XDCR processes are configured per node, use the `GET /settings/replications` HTTP method and URI, as follows.
Note that this example pipes the output to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] program, to facilitate readability.

[source,shell]
----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/replications | jq '.'
----

If successful, the command returns the following object:

[source,shell]
----
{
  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "compressionType": "Auto",
  "desiredLatency": 50,
  "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
  "failureRestartInterval": 10,
  "filterBypassExpiry": false,
  "filterDeletion": false,
  "filterExpiration": false,
  "goGC": 100,
  "goMaxProcs": 4,
  "logLevel": "Info",
  "networkUsageLimit": 0,
  "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
  "priority": "High",
  "sourceNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "statsInterval": 1000,
  "targetNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "workerBatchSize": 500
}
----

The configured number of threads is the value to `goMaxProcs`; which is currently `4.`
To change this value, use the `POST` method with the same URI, specifying the required number of processes as the value to the `--goMaxProcs` option:

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/replications \
-d goMaxProcs=5 | jq '.'
----

If successful, this returns the following object:

[source,shell]
----
{
  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "compressionType": "Auto",
  "desiredLatency": 50,
  "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
  "failureRestartInterval": 10,
  "filterBypassExpiry": false,
  "filterDeletion": false,
  "filterExpiration": false,
  "goGC": 100,
  "goMaxProcs": 5,
  "logLevel": "Info",
  "networkUsageLimit": 0,
  "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
  "priority": "High",
  "sourceNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "statsInterval": 1000,
  "targetNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "workerBatchSize": 500
}
----

This output indicates that the value of `goMaxProcs` has been appropriately incremented.
