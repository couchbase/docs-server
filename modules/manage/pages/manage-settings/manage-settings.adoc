== Settings Overview

The _settings_ for Couchbase Server can be accessed via Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *Settings* tab, in the left-hand navigation menu:

By default, this brings up the *General* settings panel.
Along the upper, horizontal control-bar, multiple tabs appear, from which different settings-categories can be selected:

The tabs are:

* _General_. Allows configuration of _name_, _memory quotas_, _storage modes_, and _node availability_ for the cluster; and of _advanced settings_ for the Index and Query Services
These are described in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General].

* _Auto compaction_, whereby data on the server is automatically compacted if specified thresholds are met.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc[Auto-Compaction].

* _Alerts_, whereby users can be notified of critical system-events.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-alerts.adoc[Alerts].

* _Sample buckets_, whereby buckets pre-populated with documents can be installed, for the purpose of experimentation and testing.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].
