[#configuring-sample-buckets]
== Sample Buckets

Full and Cluster administrators can install sample buckets using the xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Couchbase Server Web Console] and the xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#scopes-collection-and-sample-buckets]
=== Scopes, Collections, and Sample Buckets

xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections] let you organize data within a bucket by type.
The  `beer-sample` and `gamesim-sample` sample buckets store all of their data in the default scope.
The `travel-sample` bucket contains data in five scopes in addition to the `_default` scope.
These additional scopes define several collections. 
The data within the `tenant_agent_00` through `tenant_agent_04` scopes let you experiment with multi-tenancy applications.

NOTE: The `_default` scope of the `travel_sample` bucket duplicates all of the data stored in the `inventory` and `tenant_agent_00` through `tenant_agent_04` scopes.
This duplication makes the bucket compatible with scripts and applications written for versions of Couchbase Server earlier than 7.0 that did not support scopes and collections.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui]
== Install Sample Buckets with the UI

From the [.ui]*Settings* screen, select the [.ui]*Sample Buckets* tab.
The *Sample Buckets* screen now appears, as follows:

image::manage-settings/settings-samples.png[,720,align=left]

If one or more sample buckets are already loaded, they're listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.

See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles] to learn how to assign roles to users to grant access to the sample buckets.

To install, select one or more sample buckets from the displayed list, using the checkboxes provided.
For example, select the `travel-sample` bucket:

image::manage-settings/select-travel-sample-bucket.png[,220,align=left]

If there is insufficient memory available for the specified installation, a notification appears at the lower left of Couchbase Web Console:

image::manage-settings/insufficientRamWarning.png[,290,align=left]

For information about configuring memory quotas, see xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General] settings.
For information about managing (including deleting) buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

If and when you have sufficient memory, click [.ui]*Load Sample Data*.

image::manage-settings/loadSampleDataButton.png[,220,align=left]

When installed, the sample bucket is listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.
It also appears in the *Buckets* screen, where its definition can be edited.
See xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets], for information.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api]
== Install Sample Buckets with the REST API

To install sample buckets with the REST API, use the `POST /sampleBuckets/install` HTTP method and URI.
For example:

[source,console]
----
include::rest-api:example$install-sample-bucket.sh[]
----

If successful, the call returns a JSON dictionary that lists the tasks Couchbase Server started to load the buckets:

[source,json]
----
include::rest-api:example$sample-bucket-install-response.json[] 
----

You can monitor the status of these tasks using the `/pools/default/tasks` REST API endpoint. 
Pass it the `taskId` value from the task list returned by the call to `sampleBuckets/install`:

[source,console]
----
curl -s -u Administrator:password  -G http://localhost:8091/pools/default/tasks \
     -d taskId=439b29de-0018-46ba-83c3-d3f58be68b12 | jq '.' 
----

The command returns the current status of the task:

[source,json]
----
include::rest-api:example$beer-sample-task-status.json[] 
----

For more information about using the REST API, including details of how to retrieve a list of available sample buckets, see xref:rest-api:rest-sample-buckets.adoc[].
For information about deleting buckets (including sample buckets), see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc[].
