[#configuring-sample-buckets]
== Sample Buckets

Sample buckets contain data for experimental use.
Sample buckets are referred to in code and command-line examples throughout Couchbase Server documentation.

Full and Cluster administrators can install sample buckets with xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api[REST API]

[#scopes-collection-and-sample-buckets]
=== Scopes, Collections, and Sample Buckets

Couchbase Server Version 7.0 introduces xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections], which allow data within a bucket to be organized according to type.
Buckets created and used on previous versions of the server, after upgrade to 7.0, initially have all their data within the _default_ collection, which is itself within the _default_ scope.
From this point, data can be selectively migrated from the default collection into other, administrator-defined collections.

Each sample bucket provided with 7.0 contains its data _either_:

* Entirely within the default scope and collection.
These buckets are `beer-sample` and `gamesim-sample`.

* Within multiple scopes and collections that have been pre-defined to exist in addition to the default scope and collection; _and_ within the default scope and collection also.
This is the configuration provided for the `travel-sample` bucket.
In total, _seven_ scopes exist within this bucket:

** `_default`.
This contains the `_default` collection; within which all documents reside.
The `_default` collection therefore itself contains all documents that existed in pre-7.0 versions of the `travel-sample` bucket.

** `inventory`.
This also contains all documents that existed in pre-7.0 versions of the `travel-sample` buckets, but in a different configuration: here, the documents are distributed, according to type, across five collections; which are named `airline`, `airport`, `landmark`, `hotel`, and `route`.

** `tenant_agent_00` to `tenant_agent_04`.
Each of these five scopes contains two collections; which are named `users` and `bookings`.

Since all three sample buckets contain, in their default collection, all data they held in pre-7.0 versions of Couchbase Server, programs written to access this data in its original locations will be able to continue doing so with minimal adjustment.
All three buckets can also be used for experiments with _migration_, whereby the data is selectively redistributed into administrator-created collections.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/replicate-using-scopes-and-collections.adoc#migrate-data-to-a-collection-with-the-ui[Migrate Data to a Collection with the UI].

The `travel-sample` bucket contains travel-related data in migrated form, within the collections in the scope `inventory`.
The bucket can thus be used for immediate experimentation with application-access to scopes and collections.

The `travel-sample` bucket also contains data within the `tenant_agent` scopes, which is appropriate for experimentation with _multi-tenancy-based_ application access.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui]
== Install Sample Buckets with the UI

From the [.ui]*Settings* screen, select the [.ui]*Sample Buckets* tab.
The *Sample Buckets* screen now appears, as follows:

image::manage-settings/settings-samples.png[,720,align=left]

Note that if one or more sample buckets have already been loaded, they are listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.

For information on assigning roles to users, so as to enable them to access sample buckets following installation, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].

To install, select one or more sample buckets from the displayed list, using the checkboxes provided.
For example, select the `travel-sample` bucket:

image::manage-settings/select-travel-sample-bucket.png[,220,align=left]

If there is insufficient memory available for the specified installation, a notification appears at the lower left of Couchbase Web Console:

image::manage-settings/insufficientRamWarning.png[,290,align=left]

For information on configuring memory quotas, see the information on xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General] settings.
For information on managing (including deleting) buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

If and when you have sufficient memory, click [.ui]*Load Sample Data*.

image::manage-settings/loadSampleDataButton.png[,220,align=left]

When installed, the sample bucket is listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.
It also appears in the *Buckets* screen, where its definition can be edited.
See xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets], for information.


[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli]
== Install Sample Buckets with the CLI

To install sample buckets with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbdocloader-tool.adoc[cbdocloader] command.
To specify a sample bucket, refer to the bucket's _zip file_, which is located in the host platform's Couchbase Server samples directory.
For Linux, this location is `/opt/couchbase/samples`.
The zip file contains the JSON data for the bucket.
The command creates a bucket, and installs the JSON data within it.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -c localhost:8091 \
-u Administrator -p password -b testBucket -m 256 \
-d /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
----

This specifies that the JSON data in the zip file be installed into a new Couchbase bucket named `testBucket`, whose memory quota is 256 megabytes.
Note that `cbdocloader` thus allows the installed sample bucket to take an original name, chosen by the user.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api]
== Install Sample Buckets with the REST API

To install sample buckets with the REST API, use the `POST /sampleBuckets/install` HTTP method and URI, as follows:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.194.101:8091/sampleBuckets/install \
-d '["travel-sample", "beer-sample"]'
----

If successful, the call returns an empty list.

For further information on using the REST API, including details of how to retrieve a list of currently available sample buckets, see xref:rest-api:rest-sample-buckets.adoc[Managing Sample Buckets].
For information on _deleting_ buckets (including sample buckets), see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc[Deleting Buckets].
