Sample buckets contain data that is ready to be experimented with.

[#configuring-sample-buckets]
== Installing Sample Buckets

Sample buckets contain data that can be experimented with, by means of Couchbase Web Console, Couchbase Services, the SDK, and CLI and REST commands.
Sample buckets are referred to in code and command-line examples throughout Couchbase Server documentation.

Full and Cluster administrators can install sample buckets with xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], or the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[CLI].
Sample buckets _cannot_ be installed with the REST API.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui]
== Install Sample Buckets with the UI

From the [.ui]*Settings* screen, select the [.ui]*Sample Buckets* tab.
The *Sample Buckets* screen now appears, as follows:

image::manage-settings/settings-samples.png[,720,align=left]

Note that if one or more sample buckets have already been loaded, they are listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.

For information on assigning roles to users, so as to enable them to access sample buckets following installation, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].

To install, select one or more sample buckets from the displayed list, using the checkboxes provided.
For example, select the `travel-sample` bucket:

image::manage-settings/select-travel-sample-bucket.png[,220,align=left]

If there is sufficient memory available for the specified installation, a notification appears at the lower left of Couchbase Web Console:

image::manage-settings/insufficientRamWarning.png[,290,align=left]

For information on configuring memory quotas, see the information on xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General] settings.
For information on managing (including deleting) buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

If and when you have sufficient memory, click [.ui]*Load Sample Data*.

image::manage-settings/loadSampleDataButton.png[,220,align=left]

When installed, the sample bucket is listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.
It also appears in the *Buckets* screen, where its definition can be edited.
See xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets], for information.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli]
== Install Sample Buckets with the CLI

To install sample buckets with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbdocloader-tool.adoc[cbdocloader] command.
To specify a sample bucket, refer to the bucket's _zip file_, which is located in the host platform's Couchbase Server samples directory.
For Linux, this location is `/opt/couchbase/samples`.
The zip file contains the JSON data for the bucket.
The command creates a bucket, and installs the JSON data within it.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -c localhost:8091 \
-u Administrator -p password -b testBucket -m 256 \
-d /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
----

This specifies that the JSON data in the zip file be installed into a new Couchbase bucket named `testBucket`, whose memory quota is 256 megabytes.
Note, therefore, that unlike the UI installation, the resulting bucket takes the name chosen by the user, rather than the name `travel-sample`.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api]
== Install Sample Buckets with the REST API

The following REST API example can be used for the initial set-up of a bucket:

----
curl -X POST -u [admin]:[password]  http://[ip_address]:8091/pools/default/buckets
  -d name=[new-bucket-name] 
  -d ramQuotaMB=[value] 
  -d authType=[none | sasl]
  -d proxyPort=[proxy-port]
----

**Notes:**

* If `authType` is set to:
** `none`: A `proxyPort` number must be specified.
** `sasl`: The `saslPassword` parameter may optionally be specified.
* The `ramQuotaMB` parameter must be set to `100` or greater, and the maximum can only be as great as the memory quota established for the node.

Example: (Note that `%2F` is the ASCII Hex mapping to the forward-slash character.)

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-d name=newBucket -d ramQuotaMB=100 -d authType=none \
-d proxyPort=11215
----
