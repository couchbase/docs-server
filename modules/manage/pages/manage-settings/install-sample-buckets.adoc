[#configuring-sample-buckets]
== Installing Sample Buckets

Sample buckets contain data for experimental use.
Sample buckets are referred to in code and command-line examples throughout Couchbase Server documentation.

Full and Cluster administrators can install sample buckets with xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api[REST API]

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui]
== Install Sample Buckets with the UI

From the [.ui]*Settings* screen, select the [.ui]*Sample Buckets* tab.
The *Sample Buckets* screen now appears, as follows:

image::manage-settings/settings-samples.png[,720,align=left]

Note that if one or more sample buckets have already been loaded, they are listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.

For information on assigning roles to users, so as to enable them to access sample buckets following installation, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].

To install, select one or more sample buckets from the displayed list, using the checkboxes provided.
For example, select the `travel-sample` bucket:

image::manage-settings/select-travel-sample-bucket.png[,220,align=left]

If there is insufficient memory available for the specified installation, a notification appears at the lower left of Couchbase Web Console:

image::manage-settings/insufficientRamWarning.png[,290,align=left]

For information on configuring memory quotas, see the information on xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General] settings.
For information on managing (including deleting) buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

If and when you have sufficient memory, click [.ui]*Load Sample Data*.

image::manage-settings/loadSampleDataButton.png[,220,align=left]

When installed, the sample bucket is listed under the *Installed Samples* section of the page.
It also appears in the *Buckets* screen, where its definition can be edited.
See xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets], for information.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli]
== Install Sample Buckets with the CLI

To install sample buckets with the CLI, use the xref:cli:cbdocloader-tool.adoc[cbdocloader] command.
To specify a sample bucket, refer to the bucket's _zip file_, which is located in the host platform's Couchbase Server samples directory.
For Linux, this location is `/opt/couchbase/samples`.
The zip file contains the JSON data for the bucket.
The command creates a bucket, and installs the JSON data within it.
For example:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -c localhost:8091 \
-u Administrator -p password -b testBucket -m 256 \
-d /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip
----

This specifies that the JSON data in the zip file be installed into a new Couchbase bucket named `testBucket`, whose memory quota is 256 megabytes.
Note that `cbdocloader` thus allows the installed sample bucket to take an original name, chosen by the user.

[#install-sample-buckets-with-the-rest-api]
== Install Sample Buckets with the REST API

To install sample buckets with the REST API, use the `POST /sampleBuckets/install` HTTP method and URI, as follows:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.194.101:8091/sampleBuckets/install \
-d '["travel-sample", "beer-sample"]'
----

If successful, the call returns an empty list.

For further information on using the REST API, including details of how to retrieve a list of currently available sample buckets, see xref:rest-api:rest-sample-buckets.adoc[Managing Sample Buckets].
For information on _deleting_ buckets (including sample buckets), see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc[Deleting Buckets].
