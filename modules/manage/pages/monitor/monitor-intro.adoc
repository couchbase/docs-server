This page summarizes the options available for monitoring Couchbase Server; and provides links to more detailed interface-descriptions.

[#monitoring-with-the-ui]
== Monitoring with the UI

Couchbase-Server statistics can be monitored by means of Couchbase Web Console.

Users with the *Full Admin* or *Bucket Admin* role can assemble statistics as _groups_ of _charts_, on the *Dashboard* of Couchbase Web Console.
This is visible by default after login; and can at any time be displayed by left-clicking on the *Dashboard* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-dashboard]
image::manage-statistics/DBaccessDB.png[,100,align=left]

Initially, prior to any definitions having been made, the *Dashboard* appears as follows:

[#dashboard-initial-appearance]
image::manage-statistics/DBblankInitial.png[,700,align=left]

From this point, charts can be assembled interactively, and statistics for Couchbase Server and all services thereby monitored.
For step-by-step instructions, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].

[#monitoring-with-cbstats]
== Monitoring with `cbstats`

The `cbstats` tool provides Data-Service statistics, for an individual, specified node.
The complete interface for `cbstats` is documented in xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

[#monitoring-with-the-rest-api]
== Monitoring with the REST API

Couchbase Server provides a REST API for xref:rest-api:rest-statistics.adoc[Getting Cluster Statistics].
Statistics are retrieved based on the specification of one or more _metrics_.
Optionally, the statistics can be further defined through the specifying of a _function_; and/or _labels_ with values.
An instance of _Prometheus_ runs on each node of the cluster; and the metrics for each node are duly stored in that nodeâ€™s instance of Prometheus.

For a complete lists of metrics, see the xref:metrics-reference/metrics-reference.adoc[Metrics Reference].

[#additional-monitoring-options]
== Additional Monitoring Options

Statistics for the Index Service can be managed by means of Couchbase Web Console: this is described in xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-indexes.adoc[Monitor Indexes].

The monitoring of statistics related to the Query Service is described in xref:manage:monitor/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc[Monitor Queries].

XDCR _timestamp-based_ conflict resolution can be monitored, as described in xref:manage:monitor/xdcr-monitor-timestamp-conflict-resolution.adoc[Monitor XDCR Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution].
