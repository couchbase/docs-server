= Monitor with the UI
:page-aliases: monitoring:ui-monitoring-statistics

[abstract]
The *Statistics* screen allows statistics for Couchbase, Ephemeral, and Memcached buckets to be displayed; either for a specific server in the cluster, or for the cluster as a whole.

[#access-bucket-statistics]
== Access Bucket Statistics

To access bucket statistics, first, access the *Buckets* screen, by left-clicking on the *Buckets* tab, in the left-hand, vertical navigation bar:

image::monitor/access-buckets-screen.png[,90]

When the *Buckets* screen is displayed, if one or more buckets have been defined, information on each is displayed, on a row that features columns for *name*, *items*, *RAM used*, and more.
To the right of each row appear tabs for *Documents*, and *Statistics*.

image::monitor/row-for-buckets.png[,800]

Left-click on the *Statistics* tab for the bucket whose information you wish to display:

image::monitor/left-click-on-statistics-tab.png[,140]

The *Statistics* screen is now displayed.
Each of the principal areas of the screen is described below, in order of vertical presentation.

[#general-controls]
== General Controls

The upper panel of the *Statistics* screen provides controls whereby display-parameters can be configured.

image::monitor/general-details-configuration.png[,640]

* *Bucket Selection* &#8212; Located at the upper left, this pull-down menu allows selection of a bucket, statistics for which will be duly displayed.
This is initially set to the choice the user made on the *Buckets* screen, when they accessed the current, *Statistics* screen.

* *Server Selection* &#8212; Located at the upper right, this pull-down menu allows selection either of an individual server, or of the whole cluster, as the basis for the information displayed by _all_ components on the *Statistics* screen.

* *Interval Selection* &#8212; Located at the right, these vertically arranged tabs support selection of the _time-interval_ according to which information will be displayed.
For example, selecting [.ui]*Minute* causes information to be shown for the most recent minute, with the chart continuously being updated.

* *Ops Per Sec.* &#8212; The main chart for the *Statistics* screen.
This initially shows _operations per second_, either for a specific server, or for the whole cluster (depending on the *Server Selection* that has been made), displayed according to the specified time-interval.
Note that left-clicking on any of the smaller charts, displayed lower on the screen, redisplays that chart as the main chart for the page, thereby substituting it for this default.

== Statistics Groups

Below the general controls, information is aggregated and displayed according to the following statistics groups.
All groups provide information that relates either to a specific server, or to the whole cluster, depending on the *Server Selection* that has been made.

* <<server_stats,Server Resources>> &#8212; Consumption of server resources.

* <<vbucket_stats,vBucket Resources>> &#8212; vBucket activities, including active, replica and pending operations.

* <<disk_stats,Disk Queues>> &#8212; Active, replica and pending disk-related activities.

* <<dcp_stats,DCP Queues>> &#8212; DCP-related activities.

* <<view_stats,View Statistics>> &#8212; Statistics for each production view configured within the bucket or system.

* <<index_stats,Index Statistics>> &#8212; Index statistics, provided per index.

* <<query_stats,Query Statistics>> &#8212; Query Service activities.
Note that these statistics are aggregated across the entire cluster, rather than per bucket or per server.

* <<incoming_xdcr_stats,XDCR Destination>> &#8212; Statistics on Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR).

* *Top Keys* &#8212; The top 10 most actively used keys, within the selected bucket.

Note that within these statistics groups, some charts are displayed only when their corresponding service or process is hosted.
For example, the chart for _outgoing XDCR operations_ is displayed only when XDCR is replicating data from the selected bucket.

Note also that certain charts displayed to indicate _Couchbase_-bucket disk activity are _not_ displayed for _Ephemeral_ buckets, since Ephemeral buckets do not support persistence.

[#viewing-statistics-per-server]
== Viewing Statistics Per Server

Each chart features a *per server* option, which allows the data to be displayed in detail for each server in the cluster.

For example, left-click on the *per server* option for the *Management Port Reqs/Sec* chart, located in the *Server Resources* statistics group:

image::monitor/get-statistics-per-server-1.png[,200]

The display changes as follows:

image::monitor/get-statistics-per-server-2.png[,660]

The display now provides separate information for each of the two servers in the current cluster, which are `101.143.192.101` and `101.143.192.103`.

[#summary_stats]
== Bucket Monitoring &#8212; Summary Statistics

The summary section provides an overview of bucket-related activity.
Each chart shows information based on the currently selected bucket.
