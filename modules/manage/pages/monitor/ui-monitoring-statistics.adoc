== Understanding Statistics Management

Couchbase Server provides statistics; which are updated continuously, and so always represent the current state of the cluster.
Statistics refer to buckets, nodes, clusters, and services.

Statistics can be viewed by means of Couchbase Web Console.
Users with the *Full Admin* or *Bucket Admin* role can assemble statistics as _groups_ of _charts_, on the *Dashboard* of Couchbase Web Console.
This is visible by default after login; and can at any time be displayed by left-clicking on the *Dashboard* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-dashboard]

Initially, prior to any definitions having been made, the *Dashboard* appears as follows:

[#dashboard-initial-appearance]
image::manage-statistics/DBblankInitial.png[,700,align=left]

From this point, charts can be assembled interactively, and statistics for Couchbase Server and all services thereby monitored.
For step-by-step instructions, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].
