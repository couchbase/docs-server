[abstract]
From the [.ui]*Bucket* screen, statistics for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets can be displayed.
The information is aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected bucket.

[#access-bucket-statistics]
== Access Bucket Statistics

To access statistics for defined Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets, first, access the *Buckets* screen, by left-clicking on the *Buckets* tab, in the left-hand, vertical navigation bar:

image::monitor/access-buckets-screen.png[,100]

When the *Buckets* screen is displayed, if one or more buckets have been defined, information on each is displayed, on a row that features columns for *name*, *items*, *RAM used*, and more.
To the right of each row appear tabs for *Documents*, and *Statistics*.

image::monitor/row-for-buckets.png[,800]

Left-click on the *Statistics* tab:

image::monitor/left-click-on-statistics-tab.png[,180]

The *Statistics* page is now displayed.

[#general-controls]
== General Controls

The upper panel of the *Statistics* page provides controls whereby general details can be configured.

image::monitor/general-details-configuration.png[,640]

* *Bucket Selection* &#8212; The [.ui]*Buckets* selection list lets you select which of the buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph display.
The statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected bucket.

* *Server Selection* &#8212; The [.ui]*All Server Nodes* selection option enables you to limit the display to an individual server or entire cluster.
The individual node selection displays information for the node.
The all server nodes selection displays information for the entire cluster.

* *Interval Selection* &#8212; The [.ui]*Interval* selection at the top of the main graph changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page.
For example, selecting [.ui]*Minute* shows information for the last minute, continuously updating.
+
As the selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long your cluster has been running.

* *Statistic Selection* &#8212; All of the graphs within the display update simultaneously.
Clicking on any of the smaller graphs will promote that graph to be displayed as the main graph for the page.

== Individual Bucket Monitoring

The following statistic groups are available:

* <<summary_stats,Summary>> &#8212;The summary section provides a quick overview of the cluster activity.
* <<server_stats,Server Resources>> - This section provides information on the server resources across the cluster.

* <<vbucket_stats,vBucket Resources>> &#8212; This section provides detailed information on the vBucket resources across the cluster, including the active, replica and pending operations.

* <<disk_stats,Disk Queues>> &#8212; Disk queues show the activity on the backend disk storage used for persistence within a data bucket.
The information displayed shows the active, replica and pending activity.

* <<dcp_stats,DCP Queues>> &#8212; This section provides show information about the DCP connections activity for the bucket.
* <<view_stats,View Statistics>> &#8212; This section lets you monitor the statistics for each production view configured within the bucket or system.

* <<index_stats,Index Statistics>> &#8212; This section provides statistics about the GSI Indexes.
Statistics are provided per each individual index.
* <<query_stats,Query Statistics>> &#8212; This section provides statistics about the N1QL query service.
These statistics are aggregated numbers at the query service level across the cluster, and are not per bucket or per node.

* <<incoming_xdcr_stats,XDCR Destination>> &#8212; The XDCR Destination section shows you statistical information about Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR).

* *Top Keys* &#8212; This section shows a list of the top 10 most actively used keys within the selected data bucket.

Note that some charts are displayed only when their corresponding service or process is hosted.
For example, the chart for _outgoing XDCR operations_ is displayed only when XDCR is replicating data from the current node.

[#viewing-statistics-per-server]
== Viewing Statistics Per Server

Each chart features a *per server* option, which allows the data to be displayed in detail for each server in the cluster.

For example, left-click on the *per server* option for the *Management Port Reqs/Sec* chart, located in the *Server Resources* statistics group:

image::monitor/get-statistics-per-server-1.png[,200]

The display changes as follows:

image::monitor/get-statistics-per-server-2.png[,660]

The display now provides separate information for each of the two servers in the current cluster, which are `101.143.192.101` and `101.143.192.103`.

[#summary_stats]
== Bucket Monitoring &#8212; Summary Statistics

[#vbucket_stats]
== Monitoring vBucket Resources

The vBucket statistics provide information for all vBucket types within the cluster across three different states.
Within the statistic display the table of statistics is organized in four columns, showing the Active, Replica and Pending states for each individual statistic.
The last column provides the total value for each statistic.

The *Active* column displays the information for vBuckets within the Active state.
The *Replica* column displays the statistics for vBuckets within the Replica state (that is currently being replicated).
The *Pending* columns shows statistics for vBuckets in the Pending state, that is while data is being exchanged during rebalancing.

These states are shared across all the following statistics.
For example, the graph *new items per sec* within the *Active* state column displays the number of new items per second created within the vBuckets that are in the active state.

The individual statistics, one for each state, shown are:
