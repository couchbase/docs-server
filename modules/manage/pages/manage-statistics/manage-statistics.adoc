= Manage Statistics

[abstract]
Statistics on Couchbase Server can be monitored, per bucket, per node, and per cluster.

[#statistics-management-overview]
== Statistics Management

Couchbase Server provides statistics, which show the performance of the cluster to Full and Cluster administrators.
Statistics are constantly updated, and can be monitored by means of xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

== Manage Statistics with the UI

Couchbase Server allows statistics to be monitored on the *Dashboard* of Couchbase Web Console.
Open Couchbase Web Console.
The *Dashboard* should be visible by default.
If it is not visible, display it by left-clicking on the *Dashboard* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-dashboard]

Initially, prior to any definitions, the *Dashboard* appears as follows:

[#dashboard-initial-appearance]
image::manage-statistics/DBblankInitial.png[,700,align=left]

At the foot of the screen, the numbers of cluster-nodes that are _active_, _failed-over_, _pending rebalance_, and _inactive_ are listed.
Near the top, a notification is provided, regarding _buckets_:

[#dashboard-add-bucket-notification]

Couchbase Web Console organizes statistics by _bucket_.
Therefore, until a bucket is added to the cluster, no statistics can be shown.
To add a bucket, left-click on one of the options provided by the notification.
Either left-click on xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Buckets], to add a custom bucket; or, left-click on xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[sample bucket] to install a sample bucket.

The following examples assume that the `travel-sample` bucket has been added.
This is indicated by the control at the right-hand side of the screen:
