= Manage Statistics

[abstract]
Statistics on Couchbase Server can be monitored, per bucket, per node, and per cluster.

[#statistics-management-overview]
== Statistics Management

Couchbase Server provides statistics, which show the performance of the cluster to Full and Cluster administrators.
Statistics are constantly updated, and can be monitored by means of xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-ui[Couchbase Web Console], the Couchbase xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc#manage-statistics-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#manage-statistics-with-the-ui]
== Manage Statistics with the UI

Couchbase Server allows statistics to be monitored on the *Dashboard* of Couchbase Web Console.
Open Couchbase Web Console.
The *Dashboard* should be visible by default.
If it is not visible, display it by left-clicking on the *Dashboard* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-dashboard]
image::manage-statistics/DBaccessDB.png[,100,align=left]

Initially, prior to any definitions, the *Dashboard* appears as follows:

[#dashboard-initial-appearance]
image::manage-statistics/DBblankInitial.png[,700,align=left]

At the foot of the screen, the numbers of cluster-nodes that are _active_, _failed-over_, _pending rebalance_, and _inactive_ are listed.
Near the top, a notification is provided, regarding _buckets_:

[#dashboard-add-bucket-notification]
image::manage-statistics/DBaddBucketInstruction.png[,480,align=left]

Couchbase Web Console organizes statistics by _bucket_.
Therefore, until a bucket is added to the cluster, no statistics can be shown.
To add a bucket, left-click on one of the options provided by the notification.
Either left-click on xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Buckets], to add a custom bucket; or, left-click on xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[sample bucket] to install a sample bucket.

The following examples assume that the `travel-sample` bucket has been added.
This is indicated by the control at the right-hand side of the screen:

[#dashboard-travel-sample-added]
image::manage-statistics/DBtravelSampleAdded.png[,120,align=left]

[#add-a-group]
=== Add a Group

In the context of statistics-display, a _group_ consists of a number of different animated charts, which are associated with one another for purposes of display.
Once a group is defined, individual charts can be added incrementally.
Ideally, information-content of charts within a group should be related, in some significant way.
The charts within a group can then be displayed and hidden as a single unit: this optimizes use of screen real estate, when multiple groups have been defined.

To define a group, access the *Add Group* control, in the upper part of the screen:

[#access-add-group-control]
image::manage-statistics/DBclickToAddGroupOne.png[,260,align=left]

Left-clicking on the control at the right-hand side displays a pull-down dialog:

[#access-add-group-dialog-one]
image::manage-statistics/DBclickToAddGroupTwo.png[,260,align=left]

Left-click in the `new scenario...` editable text-field.
This causes the pull-down dialog to expand further:

[#access-add-group-dialog-two-point-five]
image::manage-statistics/DBclickToAddGroupTwoPointFive.png[,260,align=left]

In the `new scenario...` field, type a name for the group being defined.
In the `add optional description...` field, add a brief description of the group's purpose.
Then, left-click on the *Save* button:

[#access-add-group-dialog-three]
image::manage-statistics/DBclickToAddGroupThree.png[,260,align=left]

The *Add Group* panel now appears as follows:

[#add-group-panel-with-new-group]
image::manage-statistics/DBnewGroup.png[,260,align=left]

This indicates that a new group, named *Data Activity* has been defined, for displaying statistics on the `travel-sample` bucket.

[#add-a-chart]
=== Add a Chart

To add a chart to a defined group, left-click at the center of the blank chart-area displayed:

[#left-click-to-define-chart]
image::manage-statistics/DBaddNewChart.png[,80,align=left]

The *Add a Chart* dialog now appears:

[#add-chart-dialog-initial]
image::manage-statistics/DBaddAchartDialog.png[,520,align=left]

This dialog allows selection of information that will be displayed in a chart, associated with the established group.
The primary categories, which are horizontally distributed new the top of the panel, are *System*, *Index*, *Query*, *Data*, and *XDCR*.
Selection by left-clicking changes the selection of fields immediately below.
By default, the *System* checkboxes are initially displayed.

Note that the dialog also contains, towards the bottom, additional options.
*Display Data From* determines whether the chart displays data from the current node, or from the entire cluster.
*Chart Size* provides a pull-down menu, whereby the size of the displayed chart is selected.
*Group* allows selection among currently defined groups.

Left-click on *Data*.
The display now changes as follows:

[#add-chart-dialog-for-data]
image::manage-statistics/DBaddAchartDialogForData.png[,540,align=left]

This displays a button for each of the subcategories *Ops*, *Memory*, *Disk*, *VBucket*, *Disk Queues*, and *DCP Queues*.
Left-click on the *Ops* subcategory:

[#ops-tab]
image::manage-statistics/DBclickOnOpsTab.png[,120,align=left]

The *Add a Chart* dialog is now redisplayed: options for representing operations are provided as checkboxes:

[#add-chart-for-data-ops]
image::manage-statistics/DBaddAchartDialogForDataOps.png[,520,align=left]

Check the *ops per second* checkbox.
Note that when the mouse cursor is hovered over the checkbox, a tooltip appears:

[#ops-per-second-tool-tip]
image::manage-statistics/DBopsPerSecondToolTip.png[,260,align=left]

Then save the chart, by left-clicking on the * Chart* button, at the lower right of the dialog:

[#add-chart-save-button]
image::manage-statistics/DBsaveChartButton.png[,120,align=left]

The *Data Activity* group now appears as follows:

[#ops-per-second-chart]
image::manage-statistics/DBopsPerSecondChart.png[,560,align=left]

The *ops per second* chart is now displayed, with opportunity to create a further chart at its right.

[#use-chart]
=== Use and Edit a Chart

Within Couchbase Web Console, charts can be interactively used and edited.

Left-click on the icon at the upper-right of the chart:

[#chart-control-display-icon]
image::manage-statistics/DBshowHideChartControls.png[,160,align=left]

Controls for the chart are now displayed:

[#chart-controls]
image::manage-statistics/chartControls.png[,90,align=left]

To add information to the current chart, use the left icon:

[#left-click-chart-edit-icon]
image::manage-statistics/DBeditChartControl.png[,110,align=left]

This brings up the *Edit a Chart* dialog, previously used to create the current chart.
To add information to the current chart, make an appropriate selection.
For example, under the *System* subcategory, add statistics for maximum CPU:

[#add-max-cpu-statistics]
image::manage-statistics/DBeditChartToAddMaxCPU.png[,520,align=left]

After this setting has been saved, the chart features data for both of the selected statistics.
Observability can be enhanced by hovering the mouse cursor over the data: a pop-up appears, detailing information:

[#ops-cpu-chart-tool-tip]
image::manage-statistics/DBcompositeChartToolTip.png[,520,align=left]

The pop-up displays statistics that correspond to the precise linear points over which the mouse is hovered; and also displays the time of day to which the selected statistics corresponds.

Observability can also be enhanced by enlarging the size of the chart.
Within the *Add a Chart* dialog, access and modify the *Chart Size* control, then save:

[#add-chart-change-chart-size-control]
image::manage-statistics/DBchangeChartSize.png[,110,align=left]

The chart is correspondingly redisplayed:

[#larger-chart-size]
image::manage-statistics/DBlargeChart.png[,520,align=left]

Note that the time-granularity for all information-display can be changed, by accessing the control at the upper-center region of the *Dashboard*:

[#time-control-one]
image::manage-statistics/DBchangeTimerOne.png[,110,align=left]

The default is *hour*.
Pick an alternative from the displayed pop-up menu:

[#time-control-two]
image::manage-statistics/DBchangeTimerTwo.png[,110,align=left]

A finer granularity of data-display is correspondingly provided, with the chart being updated at a faster rate:

[#time-control-three]
image::manage-statistics/DBchangeTimerThree.png[,540,align=left]

To delete a chart, use the _trashcan_ control, at the upper-right of the chart:

[#delete-chart]
image::manage-statistics/DBdeleteChart.png[,160,align=left]

A request for confirmation is displayed:

[#confirm-chart-deletion]
image::manage-statistics/DBremoveChartConfirmation.png[,420,align=left]

Left-click on *Confirm*, to remove the chart.
Note that each _group_ also has a _trashcan_ icon, which can be used to delete the entire group.

[#working-with-multiple-charts-and-groups]
=== Working with Multiple Charts and Groups

The *Dashboard* can be configured with multiple groups, each containing multiple charts.
Controls are provided whereby groups can be displayed and hidden as appropriate, in order to optimize use of screen space.

The following example shows two groups, each with multiple charts displayed:

[#multiple-groups-and-charts-displayed]
image::manage-statistics/DPtwoGroups.png[,700,align=left]

[#manage-statistics-with-the-cli]
== Manage Statistics with the CLI

On the command-line, statistics can be managed with the xref:cli/cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats] tool.
This allows a bucket to be specified, along with different options.
The port 11210 must be specified.

For example, the `memory` option returns statistics on memory for the specified bucket:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -b travel-sample -u Administrator -p password \
localhost:11210 memory
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
 bytes:                     38010040
 ep_blob_num:               31591

 total_allocated_bytes:     67864856
 total_fragmentation_bytes: 4220648
 total_heap_bytes:          111050752
 total_metadata_bytes:      6175864
 total_resident_bytes:      103907328
 total_retained_bytes:      18448384
----

The `vbucket` option returns statistics for all vBuckets for the specified bucket.
The output can be filtered, so that a particular vBucket can be examined:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -b travel-sample -u Administrator -p password \
localhost:11210 vbucket | grep 1014
----

This produces the following output:

----
 vb_1014: active
----

For more information on available options, see xref:cli/cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].
