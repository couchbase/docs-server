== Access the Documents Workbench

You can use the *Documents* workbench to view and manage documents in a database.

image::manage-ui/documentsScreenWithDocuments.png["The Documents workbench with documents displayed",700]

To display the *Documents* workbench, do one of the following:

* In the Couchbase Web Console, choose menu:Documents[Workbench].

* Alternatively, choose menu:Buckets[], then click the *Documents* link for any bucket, scope, or collection.

[#retrieve-documents]
== Retrieve Documents

You can use the *Documents* workbench to retrieve and view the individual documents contained within a bucket, scope, or collection on the database.
The retrieved documents are summarized in a table format, with a row for each retrieved document.
Document retrieval controls at the top of the summary control the retrieval and display of documents.

The *Documents* workbench has the following controls:

* *Keyspace*: A set of three related drop-down menus:

** A drop-down menu that displays the name of the bucket whose documents are shown.
You can use the drop-down menu to select from a list of buckets in the current database.

** A drop-down menu that displays the name of the scope whose documents are shown.
The `_default` scope is the default.
You can use the drop-down menu to select from a list of all the scopes within the current bucket.

** A drop-down menu that displays the name of the collection whose documents are shown.
The `_default` collection is the default.
You can use the drop-down menu to select from a list of all the collections within the current scope.

* *Limit*: The maximum number of rows (documents) to retrieve and display at once.

* *Offset*: The number of documents in the entire set of the current bucket that is skipped, before display begins.

* *Document ID*: Accepts the ID value of a specific document.
Leave this field blank to retrieve documents based on *Limit* and *Offset*.

* *show range*: Enables you to enter starting ID and ending ID values to specify a range of ID values.

* *N1QL WHERE*: Accepts a {sqlpp} query -- specifically, a WHERE clause which determines the subset of documents to show.

// The control really is called N1QL WHERE. Do not update.

To retrieve a set of documents:

. Use the *Keyspace* drop-down menus to specify the location of the documents you want to view.
The set of retrieved documents is automatically updated based on your selections.

. (Optional) Use *Limit*, *Offset*, *Document IT*, or *N1QL WHERE* to specify a set of documents, then click btn:[Retrieve Docs] to retrieve the documents based on your configuration.

. (Optional) To view successive sets of documents, use the *next batch >* and *< prev batch* controls.

== View and Edit Existing Documents

. <<retrieve-documents,Retrieve>> a set of documents.
