== Bucket Management Overview

Couchbase _buckets_, used to store data, can be created, edited, flushed, and deleted; by means of Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, and the REST API.
A maximum of 30 buckets can be created per cluster.
This section provides the basic procedures for bucket-management.

For a complete conceptual and architectural overview of Couchbase buckets, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Buckets].

Couchbase offers two different storage engines for storing the underlying data in buckets: `Couchstore` and `Magma`. 
For an overview of the backend storage mechanisms, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/backend-storage.adoc[]
