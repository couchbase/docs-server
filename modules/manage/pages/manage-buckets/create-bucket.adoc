== Create a Bucket with The UI

To create a bucket with the Couchbase UI: 

. Log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
. Go to [.ui]*Buckets*.
. Select btn:[Add Bucket].
+
The [.ui]*Add Data Bucket* dialog appears:

[#add-data-bucket-dialog-initial]
image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogInitial.png[,320,align=left]

[start="4"]
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the new bucket.

[NOTE]
====
A bucket name can be up to 100 characters in length and contain:

* Uppercase and lowercase characters (A-Z and a-z)
* Digits (0-9)
* Underscores (_), periods (.), dashes (-), and percent symbols (%)
====
[start="5"]
. Choose a *Bucket Type* for the bucket: 
+
* *Couchbase*
* *Memcached*
* *Ephemeral*
+
For more information about bucket types, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[].
. Choose a *Storage Backend* for the bucket:
+
* *Couchstore*
* *Magma*
+
For more information about the available storage engines, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage-engines.adoc[Storage Engines].

. In the *Memory Quota* field, enter a value in MiB per node for the total RAM available for the bucket. This value can't exceed the total RAM quota for your cluster. 

NOTE: Your memory quota needs to match the minimum memory resident ratio required by your chosen storage engine. 
For more information, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#bucket-memory[Bucket Memory Quotas].

[start="8"]
. Expand *Advanced bucket settings*. 
. Set any advanced settings for your bucket. See <<advanced-bucket-settings>>.
. Select btn:[Add Bucket].

The bucket appears on the *Buckets* screen: 

image::manage-buckets/bucketsViewWithCreatedBucket.png[,750,align=left]

You can view the following information for the bucket: 

* The number of items the bucket contains. 
* The percentage of items in the bucket that are currently resident. 
* The number of operations per second being performed on the bucket. 
* The amount of RAM the bucekt is currently using, compared to its memory quota. 
* The amount of disk space used by the bucket. 

You can also view the xref:manage:manage-ui/manage-ui.adoc#console-documents[Documents] in the bucket and create xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections]. 

For information about how to import documents into a bucket, see xref:manage:import-documents/import-documents.adoc[Import Documents].

[#advanced-bucket-settings]

[#couchbase-bucket-settings]
==== Couchbase Bucket Settings

To configure advanced settings for a Couchbase bucket: 

. To enable xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[replica creation and management], under *Replicas*, select the btn:[Enable] checkbox. 

.. In the *Number of replica (backup) copies* list, select the number of replicas for the bucket. 

.. To replicate view indexes and data from the bucket, select the btn:[Replicate view indexes] checkbox.

. To set a xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[document expiration] for documents in the bucket, under *Bucket Max Time-To-Live*, select the btn:[Enable] checkbox.

.. In the *Seconds* field, enter the maximum time in seconds that a document can exist in the bucket before it's deleted. 
+
TIP: The maximum allowed value is 2147483648 seconds (68.096 years). 
You can only apply this setting to documents created after you change the configuration. 

. Choose a *Compression Mode* for the bucket: 
+
* *Off* 
* *Passive*
* *Active*
+
For more information about the available compression modes, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/compression.adoc[].

. Choose a *Conflict Resolution* method for Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) on this bucket: 
+
* *Sequence number* 
* *Timestamp*
+
For more information about XDCR conflict resolution, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc[].

. Choose an *Ejection Method* for the bucket: 
+
* *Value-only*
* *Full*
+
For more information about ejection, see the xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#ejection[Ejection section in Memory].
+
include::learn:partial$full-ejection-note.adoc[]

[#bucket-priority, start="6"]
. Choose a *Bucket Priority* for the bucket: 
+
* *Default*
* *High*
+
Bucket Priority sets the priority of the bucket's background tasks relative to the background tasks of other buckets on the cluster. 
+
Background tasks may involve disk I/O, DCP stream-processing, item-paging, and more. 
Specifying High might result in faster processing for the current bucket's tasks. 
This setting only takes effect when there is more than one bucket defined for the cluster, and you have assigned different Bucket Priority values.

[#durability-level, start="7"]
. In the *Minimum Durability Level* list, select a durability level for the bucket: 
+
* *none*
* *majority*
* *majorityAndPersistActive*
* *persistToMajority*
+
For more information about durability, see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[].

. To enable automatic compaction of data and indexes to save space, select the btn:[Auto-Compaction] checkbox. 

.. To override the default Auto-Compaction settings, select the btn:[Override the default auto-compaction settings?] checkbox. 
+
For more information about how to configure Auto-Compaction, see xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc[].

. To enable flushing for the bucket, under *Flush*, select the btn:[Enable] checkbox.
+
For more information about flushing, see xref:manage-buckets/flush-bucket.adoc[Flush a Bucket].

image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogExpandedForMemcached.png[,350,align=left]

[#ephemeral-bucket-settings]
==== Ephemeral Bucket Settings

To configure advanced settings for an Ephemeral bucket: 

. To enable xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[replica creation and management], under *Replicas*, select the btn:[Enable] checkbox. 

.. In the *Number of replica (backup) copies* list, select the number of replicas for the bucket. 

. . To set a xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[document expiration] for documents in the bucket, under *Bucket Max Time-To-Live*, select the btn:[Enable] checkbox.

.. In the *Seconds* field, enter the maximum number of seconds a document can exist in the bucket before it's deleted. 
+
TIP: The maximum allowed value is 2147483648 seconds (68.096 years). 
You can only apply this setting to documents created after you change the configuration. 

. Choose a *Compression Mode* for the bucket: 
+
* *Off*
* *Passive*
* *Active* 
+
For more information about the available compression modes, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/compression.adoc[].

. Choose a *Conflict Resolution* method for Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) on this bucket: 
+
* *Sequence number*
* *Timestamp* 
+
For more information about XDCR conflict resolution, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc[].

. Choose a *Bucket Priority*: 
+
* *Default*
* *High*
+
Bucket Priority sets the priority of the bucket's background tasks relative to the background tasks of other buckets on the cluster. 
+
Background tasks may involve DCP stream-processing, item-paging, and more. 
Specifying High might result in faster processing for the current bucket's tasks. T
his setting only takes effect when there is more than one bucket defined for the cluster, and the buckets are assigned different Bucket Priority values.

. Choose an *Ejection Policy* for the bucket: 
+
* *No ejection* 
* *Eject data when RAM is full* 
+
For more information about ejection, see the xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#ejection[Ejection section in Memory].

. In the *Metadata Purge Interval* field, enter a value between `0.0007-60` to set how often a node purges metadata on deleted items.
+
A value of `0.0007` equals a minute. 
A value of `0.5` equals 12 hours. 
If this value is too high, the node might have a delay when reclaiming memory. 
If set too low, data might be inconsistent in XDCR or Views. 

. In the *Minimum Durability Level* list, select a durability level for the bucket: 
+
* *none*
* *majority*
+
For more information about durability, see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[].

[#create-bucket-with-the-cli]
== Create a Bucket with the CLI

To create a bucket with the Couchbase CLI, use the `bucket-create` command.

For example:

----
./couchbase-cli bucket-create \
--cluster 10.143.201.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--bucket-type couchbase \
--bucket-ramsize 1024 \
--max-ttl 500000000 \
--durability-min-level persistToMajority \
--enable-flush 0
----

The preceding example creates a `Couchbase` bucket named `testBucket`, with a RAM size of `1024`.
 It sets a Maximum Time-to-Live and disables Flush. 
 It also sets a Minimum Durability Level of `persistToMajority`. 

For more information about `bucket-create` and its parameters, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc[bucket-create] in the Couchbase CLI reference.

[#create-bucket-with-the-rest-api]
== Create a Bucket with the REST API

To create a bucket with the Couchbase REST API, use the `POST` http method, with the `/pools/default/buckets` endpoint.

For example:

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-u Administrator:password \
-d name=testBucket \
-d bucketType=couchbase \
-d ramQuotaMB=512 \
-d durabilityMinLevel=majorityAndPersistActive
----

The preceding example creates a `Couchbase` bucket named `testBucket`, with a RAM size of `512`. 
It sets a Minimum Durability Level of `majorityAndPersistActive`.

For more information about the `/pools/default/buckets` endpoint and its parameters, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets] in the Buckets API reference.
