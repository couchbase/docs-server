= Create a Bucket
:page-aliases: clustersetup:create-bucket

[abstract]
_Full_ and _Cluster_ Administrators can use Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, or the REST API to create a bucket.

[#examples-on-this-pages]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create a bucket by means of the xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc#create-bucket-using-couchbase-web-console[UI], xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc#create-bucket-with-the-cli[CLI] and xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc#create-bucket-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

[#create-bucket-using-couchbase-web-console]
== Create a Bucket with The UI

A maximum of 30 buckets can be created per cluster.
To create a bucket, access Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Buckets* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar at the left-hand side:

[#access_bucket_tab]
image::manage-buckets/accessBucketTab.png[,100,align=left]

The [.ui]*Buckets* screen now appears, showing the buckets that have already been defined for your system.
If you are accessing this screen immediately after setting up the cluster, no buckets are yet defined:

[#buckets_view_initial]
image::manage-buckets/bucketsViewInitial.png[,880,align=left]

To create a new bucket, left-click on *ADD BUCKET*, at the upper-right:

[#add-bucket-button]
image::manage-buckets/addBucketButton.png[,110,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Add Data Bucket* dialog, which appears as follows:

[#add-data-bucket-dialog-initial]
image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogInitial.png[,320,align=left]

Enter a bucket name into the interactive [.ui]*Name* text-field.
A bucket name can only contain characters in the ranges of A-Z, a-z, and 0-9; with the addition of the underscore, period, dash and percent characters; and can be no more than 100 characters in length.

Next, specify an appropriate memory quota for your bucket, in the [.ui]*Memory Quota* field: either enter a figure by typing at the keyboard; or, with the mouse, access the arrow-icons at the right-hand side of the interactive text-field, to increment or decrement the default value.
The quota you specify is allocated for your bucket on a per node basis.
The value you enter must fit with the overall cluster RAM quota.
The cluster quota is displayed as a figure; and also graphically, as a horizontal display-bar.
The bar provides size-information for the bucket you are creating, for the amount of memory already added to other buckets, and for the amount currently free.

Note that the bucket RAM-quota you have established can be dynamically altered after bucket-creation, provided that cluster-resources are sufficient.

Now, proceed to establish _advanced settings_ for your bucket.

== Establish Advanced Bucket Settings

Three [.ui]*Bucket Type* options are displayed: which are [.ui]*Couchbase*, [.ui]*Memcached*, and [.ui]*Ephemeral*.
For information on the differences between these bucket-types, see
xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Buckets].

Selection of each bucket-type provides a different set of advanced settings, which can be used to configure the bucket.
The bucket-type selected by default is [.ui]*Couchbase*.
Therefore, to see the advanced settings associated with this bucket-type, left-click on the right-pointing arrowhead labelled [.ui]*Advanced bucket settings*.
This causes the [.ui]*Add Data Bucket* dialog to expand vertically, as shown below.

== Couchbase Bucket-Settings

The advanced bucket-settings for the [.ui]*Couchbase* bucket-type are as follows:

[#add-data-bucket-dialog-expanded]
image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogExpanded.png[,350,align=left]

The fields are as follows:

* [.ui]*Replicas*: Allows replica-creation to be enabled and managed.
To enable, check the [.ui]*Enable* checkbox.
The number of replica-copies to be created and maintained is determined by means of the [.ui]*Number of replica (backup) copies* pulldown menu, which allows a value from 1 to 3 to be selected.
+
By checking the [.ui]*Replicate view indexes* checkbox, you ensure that view indexes, as well as data, are replicated.
+
For detailed information on replication, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster Replication].

* [.ui]*Bucket Max Time-To-Live*: If the [.ui]*Enable* checkbox is checked, the integer specified in the [.ui]*seconds* field determines the maximum time a document can exist, following its creation within this bucket, before being deleted.
The maximum time that can be specified is 2147483648 (68.096 years).
The setting is applied to all documents created after the setting is itself established.
+
For detailed information, see
xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

* [.ui]*Compression Mode*: Controls whether and how compression is applied to data within the bucket.
For detailed information, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/compression.adoc[Compression].

* [.ui]*Conflict Resolution*: A _conflict_ occurs during XDCR, when a document has been modified in different ways in different locations; necessitating that one of the versions be chosen for retention, and the other discarded.
There are two methods for making this choice: these are represented by the [.ui]*Sequence number* and [.ui]*Timestamp* checkboxes.
The method you choose is permanently established for the current bucket: it cannot subsequently be changed.
For information on the significance of each method, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc[XDCR Conflict Resolution].
+
Note that you can also set the conflict resolution method using the CLI xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc[bucket-create] command, or the xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[REST API].

* [.ui]*Ejection Method*: For Couchbase buckets, the options are [.ui]*Value-only* and [.ui]*Full*.
If [.ui]*Full* is selected, everything (including data, metadata, key, and value) is ejected.
If [.ui]*Value-only* is selected, only data is ejected.
Generally, Value-only ejection favors performance at the expense of memory; and Full ejection vice versa.
See xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#ejection[Ejection], for more information.
Note that _ejection_ in the context of a Couchbase bucket means removal from memory, with continued persistence on disk.

[#bucket-priority]
* [.ui]*Bucket Priority*: Allows you to specify the priority of the current Couchbase bucket's background tasks, relative to the background tasks of other buckets on the cluster.
Background tasks may involve disk I/O, DCP stream-processing, item-paging, and more.
+
Radio-buttons allow [.ui]*Default* or [.ui]*High* to be chosen.
These settings determine whether the bucket's tasks are enqueued in low or high priority task-queues.
Specifying High _may_ result in faster processing for the current bucket's tasks.
However, the specification only makes a difference when there is more than one bucket defined for the cluster, and when those buckets are assigned different priority-values.
See xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data Service], for further information.

* *Durability Level*: Allows an appropriate durability level to be assigned to the bucket.
Levels are accessed by means of a pull-down menu.
The options are *None*, *Majority*, *Majority and persist to active*, and *Persist to majority*.
For information, see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability].

* [.ui]*Auto-Compaction*: Allows triggering of the process whereby data and indexes are compacted automatically on a system-defined schedule, to save space.
To override the default settings, check the checkbox marked [.ui]*Override the default auto-compation settings?* If you do so, the dialog goes through a further vertical expansion; and additional fields are displayed, whereby you can specify your own compaction-settings.
For information on the defaults, and on the options provided for overriding them, see
xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc[Configuring Auto-Compaction].
* [.ui]*Flush*: This section allows flushing to be enabled.
If it is enabled, and flushing is performed, items in the bucket are removed as soon as possible.
See
xref:manage-buckets/flush-bucket.adoc[Flush a Bucket], for details.

== Memcached Bucket-Settings

To see advanced settings for a Memcached bucket, check the [.ui]*Memcached* checkbox.
The advanced settings now appear as follows:

[#add-data-bucket-dialog-expanded-for-memcached]
image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogExpandedForMemcached.png[,350,align=left]

The only advanced setting that applies to Memcached is [.ui]*Flush*, whose function is identical to that described above for Couchbase buckets.

== Ephemeral Bucket-Settings

To see advanced settings for an Ephemeral bucket, check the [.ui]*Ephemeral* checkbox.
The advanced settings now appear as follows:

[#add-data-bucket-dialog-expanded-for-ephemeral]
image::manage-buckets/addDataBucketDialogExpandedForEphemeral.png[,350,align=left]

The settings [.ui]*Conflict Resolution*, [.ui]*Bucket Max Time-to-Live*, [.ui]*Compression Mode*, and [.ui]*Flush* are identical in functionality for both Ephemeral and Couchbase buckets.

The following settings are different for Ephemeral buckets:

* [.ui]*Replicas*: The [.ui]*Replicate view indexes* checkbox is not available for Ephemeral buckets: it is available for Couchbase buckets only.
* [.ui]*Bucket Priority*: Background tasks exclude disk I/0, since this is not applicable to Ephemeral buckets.
* [.ui]*Ejection Method*: For Ephemeral buckets, the options are [.ui]*No ejection* and [.ui]*NRU ejection*.
If [.ui]*No ejection* is selected, no ejection of existing data occurs, and attempts to cache new data fail.
If [.ui]*NRU ejection* is selected, existing data is ejected, with _Not Recently Used_ documents being those removed.
Note that _ejection_ when applied to an Ephemeral bucket means removal of bucket-data from memory without persistence (since ephemeral buckets have no presence on disk).
* [.ui]*Metadata Purge Interval*: This setting, here provided at the top level of the user interface for Ephemeral buckets, was made visible for Couchbase buckets only by checking the [.ui]*Auto-Compaction* checkbox.
See xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc[Configuring Auto-Compaction] for information on how to use this setting.

When all fields have been appropriately filled, left-click on the *Add Bucket* button, at the bottom right of the dialog:

image::manage-buckets/addBucketButton.png[,150,align=left]

The bucket is now added to Couchbase Server, and can be viewed on the *Buckets* screen:

image::manage-buckets/bucketsViewWithSecondBucket.png[,750,align=left]

[#create-bucket-with-the-cli]
== Create a Bucket with the CLI

To create a bucket with the Couchbase CLI, use the `bucket-create` command.
For example:

----
./couchbase-cli bucket-create \
--cluster 10.143.201.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--bucket testBucket \
--bucket-type couchbase \
--bucket-ramsize 1024 \
--max-ttl 500000000 \
--durability-min-level persistToMajority \
--enable-flush 0
----

This creates a _Couchbase_ bucket named `testBucket`, with a RAM size of `1024`; specifying a maximum time-to-live, and disabling flush.
Note that a minimum durability level of `persistToMajority` is specified: other permitted settings for this parameter are `none` (the default), `majorityAndPersistActive`, and `majority`.
For details on the significance of these settings, see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability].
(Note that an _Ephemeral_ bucket, when created, can only use the `none` and `majority` settings, for this parameter.)

For further information on `bucket-create` and its additional parameters, see the reference page for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-create.adoc[bucket-create].

[#create-bucket-with-the-rest-api]
== Create a Bucket with the REST API

To create a bucket with the Couchbase REST API, use the `POST` http method, with the `/pools/default/buckets` endpoint.
For example:

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-u Administrator:password \
-d name=testBucket \
-d bucketType=couchbase \
-d ramQuotaMB=512 \
-d durabilityMinLevel=majorityAndPersistActive
----

This creates a _Couchbase_ bucket named `testBucket`, with a RAM size of `512`.
Note that a minimum durability level of `majorityAndPersistActive` is specified: other permitted settings for this parameter are `none` (the default), `majority`, and `persistToMajority`.
For details on the significance of these settings, see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability].
(Note that an _Ephemeral_ bucket, when created, can only use the `none` and `majority` settings, for this parameter.)

For further information, see the REST API reference page xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].
