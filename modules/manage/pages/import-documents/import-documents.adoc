= Import Documents

[abstract]
Couchbase Web Console provides a graphical interface for the importing of documents, in both JSON and other formats.

[#importing-documents]
== Options for Importing Documents

Documents can be imported into Couchbase Server by means of the following:

* The *cbimport-json* command-line utility, which imports JSON files.

* The *cbimport-csv* command-line utility, which imports files that contain data in CSV and other similar formats.

* The interactive controls provided on the Couchbase Web Console *Import Documents* panel, on the *Documents* screen; which allows importation of both JSON and CSV-type files.

The *cbimport-json* and *cbimport-csv* command-line utilities are recommended whenever high-performance importation is required; and especially when the data-set is greater than 100 MB.

For information on the *cbimport* suite of command-line utilities, access the *cbimport* entry, in the *CLI Reference*, in the vertical navigation bar, to the left.
The remainder of this page explains how to import documents by means of Couchbase Web Console.

== Importing Documents with the UI

Before attempting to import documents with Couchbase Web Console, ensure that the *Query* and *Index* Services are both deployed on the cluster: document-importation with Couchbase Web Console depends on these services.

=== Access the Import Documents Panel

Access the *Import Documents* panel of Couchbase Web Console, as follows:

. Left-click on the *Documents* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:
+
image::import-documents/accessDocumentsTab.png[,120,align=left]

. When the *Documents* screen appears, select the *Import Documents* tab, on the horizontal navigation bar, near the top:
+
image::import-documents/accessImportDocumentsTab.png[,400,align=left]

The *Import Documents* panel is now displayed:

image::import-documents/importDocumentsPanel.png[,720,align=left]

The panel displays the following interactive graphical elements:

* *Select File to Import*.
A button that, when left-clicked on, displays a file-selection interface, whereby the file to be imported into Couchbase Server can be selected from the filesystem.

* *Parse File As*.
A pulldown menu, which allows specification of the _type_ of the file to be imported.
The menu appears as follows:
+
image::import-documents/parseFileAsMenu.png[,200,align=left]
+
The options, *CSV*, *TSV*, *JSON List*, and *JSON Lines*, are described below.

* *Destination Bucket*.
A pulldown menu, which displays all buckets available on the cluster.
The selected bucket is the one into which importation of the select file is to occur.

* *Import With Document ID*.
Two radio-buttons, which allow specification of how the _id_ of the newly imported document is to be determined.
The *UUID* option specifies that a _Universal Unique Identifier_ be generated automatically, and used as the document's id.
The *Value of Field* option specifies that the _value_ that corresponds to a particular _key_ or _field_ within the document should be used as the document's _id_.
Both of these options are demonstrated below.

* The *cbimport* command-line option.
The command and appropriate parameters can be entered into the interactive field, and the command then executed.
This is described below.

* *File Contents*.
An interactive panel that displays the contents of the imported file.
The contents of the file may be edited, by means of this panel.
The panel provides three display options: these are *Raw File*, which displays the unformatted file-contents; *Parse Table*, which shows the file-contents as a table, with rows and columns; and *Parse JSON*, which shows the file as formatted JSON.

* *Import Data*.
This button is to be left-clicked on, when all appropriate details of the file to be imported have been entered.
