= Import Documents

[abstract]
Couchbase Web Console provides a graphical interface for the importing of documents, in both JSON and other formats.

[#importing-documents]
== Options for Importing Documents

Documents can be imported into Couchbase Server by means of the following:

* The *cbimport-json* command-line utility, which imports JSON documents.

* The *cbimport-csv* command-line utility, which imports documents that contain data in CSV and other similar formats.

* The interactive controls provided on the Couchbase Web Console *Import Documents* panel, on the *Documents* screen; which allows importation of both JSON and CSV-type files.

The *cbimport-json* and *cbimport-csv* command-line utilities should be used in preference to Couchbase Web Console, whenever high-performance importing is required; and especially when the data-set is greater in size than 100 MB.

For information on the *cbimport* suite of command-line utilities, access the *cbimport* entry, in the *CLI Reference*, in the vertical navigation bar, to the left.
The remainder of this page explains how to import documents by means of Couchbase Web Console.
Note the following prerequisites:

* Documents must be imported into a specific bucket.
Therefore, before attempting to import, ensure that an appropriate bucket exists.
If necessary, create a bucket, following the instructions provided in xref:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[Create a Bucket].
The following instructions assume that a bucket named `testBucket` has been created.

* Before attempting to import documents with Couchbase Web Console, ensure that the *Query Service* has been deployed on the cluster: document-importation with Couchbase Web Console depends on this service.

[#access-the-import-documents-panel]
=== Access the Import Documents Panel

Access the *Import Documents* panel of Couchbase Web Console, as follows:

. Left-click on the *Documents* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:
+
image::import-documents/accessDocumentsTab.png[,120,align=left]

. When the *Documents* screen appears, select the *Import Documents* tab, on the horizontal navigation bar, near the top:
+
image::import-documents/accessImportDocumentsTab.png[,400,align=left]

The *Import Documents* panel is now displayed:

image::import-documents/importDocumentsPanel.png[,720,align=left]

The panel displays the following interactive graphical elements:

* *Select File to Import*.
A button that, when left-clicked on, displays a file-selection interface, whereby the file to be imported into Couchbase Server can be selected from the filesystem.

* *Parse File As*.
A pulldown menu, which allows specification of the _type_ of the file to be imported.
The menu appears as follows:
+
image::import-documents/parseFileAsMenu.png[,200,align=left]
+
The options, *CSV*, *TSV*, *JSON List*, and *JSON Lines*, are described below.

* *Destination Bucket*.
A pulldown menu, which displays all buckets available on the cluster.
The selected bucket is the one into which importation of the select file is to occur.
For example:
+
image::import-documents/destinationBucketSelectTestBucket.png[,320,align=left]

* *Import With Document ID*.
Two radio-buttons, which allow specification of how the _id_ of the newly imported document is to be determined.
The *UUID* option specifies that a _Universal Unique Identifier_ be generated automatically, and used as the document's id.
The *Value of Field* option specifies that the _value_ that corresponds to a particular _key_ or _field_ within the document should be used as the document's _id_: this option is only activated _after_ a document has been selected for import, such that its fields can be accessed and corresponding values determined.
+
Both of these options are demonstrated below.

* The *cbimport* command-line display.
This display changes dynamically, to indicate the underlying command that is being prepared for execution, by means of the user's adding data to the interactive fields of the *Import Documents* panel.

* *File Contents*.
A read-only panel that displays the contents of the imported file.
The panel provides three display options: these are *Raw File*, which displays the unformatted file-contents; *Parse Table*, which shows the file-contents as a table, with rows and columns; and *Parse JSON*, which shows the file as formatted JSON.

* *Import Data*.
This button is to be left-clicked on, when all appropriate details of the file to be imported have been entered: data-import is then attempted.

[#import-json-list]
=== Import a JSON List

To import one or more JSON documents, the documents must be specified in a file, and the file then specified as the target for import.
The documents can be specified in either of two ways: as a _list_, or as a series of _lines_.

To import a JSON _list_, proceed as follows.

. Save the following JSON list, as a file named `list.json`:
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {"name": "jane", "age": 22, "height": 5.2, "weight": 97},
  {"name": "jack", "age": 18, "height": 5.9, "weight": 138},
  {"name": "henry", "age": 47},
  {"name": "susan", "age": 35, "height": 5.1, "weight": 110, "birth": {"dayOfBirth": 17, "monthOfBirth": 4}},
  {"name": "david", "age": 43, "height": 5.11, "weight": 195, "birth": {"dayOfBirth": 3, "monthOfBirth": 12}}
]
----
+
The file thus contains a JSON array of six elements.
Each element is a document, containing multiple key-value pairs.

. Within the *Import Documents* panel, left-click on the *Select File to Import* button:
+
image::import-documents/selectFileToImport.png[,320,align=left]
+
The brings up the file-selection interface specific to the host operating system.
Use this to select the file targeted for import.
For example:
+
image::import-documents/fileSelectionInterface.png[,200,align=left]
+
When the file `list.json` has been selected, the *Import Documents* panel appears as follows:
+
image::import-documents/importDocumentsWithInitialContent.png[,720,align=left]
+
The filename `list.json` now appears to the right of the *Select File to Import* button.
The *Parse File As* menu displays *JSON List*, indicating that Couchbase Server has recognized the file type.
Note that, under *Import With Document ID*, the *Value of Field* option has now become activated; and displays, as placeholder text, a common _key_ it has encountered, which is `name`.
+
The *cbimport* command-line display has changed, to indicate how much information has so far been provided, for use by the underlying *cbimport* command.
The *File Contents* field now shows the file contents, by default as a *Parsed Table*.

. Specify a destination bucket, using the *Destination Bucket* menu.
In this case, `testBucket` is selected:
+
image::import-documents/destinationBucketSelectTestBucket.png[,320,align=left]
+
The selection is then duly represented in the *Destination Bucket* field:
+
image::import-documents/destinationBucketAfterBucketSelection.png[,320,align=left]
