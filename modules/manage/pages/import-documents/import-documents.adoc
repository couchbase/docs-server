= Import Documents

[abstract]
Couchbase Web Console provides a graphical interface for the importing of documents, in both JSON and other formats.

[#importing-documents]
== Options for Importing Documents

Documents can be imported into Couchbase Server by means of the following:

* The *cbimport-json* command-line utility, which imports JSON files.

* The *cbimport-csv* command-line utility, which imports files that contain data in CSV and other similar formats.

* The interactive controls provided on the Couchbase Web Console *Import Documents* panel, on the *Documents* screen; which allows importation of both JSON and CSV-type files.

The *cbimport-json* and *cbimport-csv* command-line utilities are recommended whenever high-performance importation is required; and especially when the data-set is greater than 100 MB.

For information on the *cbimport* suite of command-line utilities, access the *cbimport* entry, in the *CLI Reference*, in the vertical navigation bar, to the left.
The remainder of this page explains how to import documents by means of Couchbase Web Console.

== Importing Documents with the UI

Before attempting to import documents with Couchbase Web Console, ensure that the *Query* and *Index* Services are both deployed on the cluster: document-importation with Couchbase Web Console depends on these services.

Access the *Import Documents* section of Couchbase Web Console, as follows:

. Left-click on the *Documents* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:
