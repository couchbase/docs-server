[abstract]
The _Logging_ facility allows a record to be maintained of important events that occur on Couchbase Server.

[#logging_overview]
== Logging Overview

The Couchbase Logging facility records important events, and saves the details to log files, on disk.
Additionally, events of cluster-wide significance are displayed on the *Logs* screen, in Couchbase Web Console.
This may appear as follows:

[#welcome]
image::manage-logging/loggingScreenBasic.png[,720,align=left]

By default, on Linux systems, log files are saved to `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; on MacOS, to `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; and on Windows, to `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs`.

[#collecting_information]
== Collecting Information

On each node within a Couchbase Server-cluster, logging is performed continuously.
_A subset_ of the results can be reviewed in the Couchbase Web Console *Logs* screen; while _all_ details are saved to the `logs` directory, as described above.
(Note that the  `logs` directory may include `audit.log`.
This is a special log file, used to manage cluster-security, and is handled separately from the other log files.
The information provided throughout the remainder of this page — on collecting, uploading, redacting, and more — _does not_ apply to `audit.log`.
For information on `audit.log`, see xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].)

Additionally, _explicit logging_ can be performed by the user.
This allows comprehensive and fully updated information to be generated as required.
The output includes everything currently on disk, together with additional data that is gathered in real time.
Explicit logging can either be performed for all nodes in the cluster, or for one or more individual nodes.
The results are saved as zip files: each zip file contains the log-data generated for an individual node.

Explicit logging can be performed by means of the Couchbase CLI utility `cbcollect_info`.
The documentation for this utility, provided
xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[here], includes a complete list of the log files that can be created, and a description of the contents of each.

Explicit logging can also be performed by means of Couchbase Web Console: on the *Logs* page, left-click on the [.ui]*Collect Information* tab, located near the top.

[#collect_info]
image::manage-logging/collectInfo.png[,248,align=left]

This brings up the *Collect Information* screen:

[#collect_info_screen]
image::manage-logging/collectInformationScreen.png[,720,align=left]

This allows logs and diagnostic information to be collected either from all or from selected nodes within the cluster.
It also allows a *Log Redaction Level* to be specified (this is described in
xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc#applying_redaction[Applying Redaction], below).
The *Specify custom temp directory* checkbox can be checked to specify the absolute pathname of a directory into which data is temporarily saved, during the collection process.
The *Specify custom destination directory* can be checked to specify the absolute pathname of a directory into which the completed zip files are saved.

The *Upload to Couchbase* checkbox is described in
xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc#uploading_log_files[Uploading Log Files], below.

To start the collection-process, left-click on the [.ui]*Start Collection* button.
A notification is displayed, indicating that the collection-process is running.
A button is provided to allow the collection-process to be stopped, if this should be appropriate.
Whenever the collection-process completes for one of the nodes, a notification is displayed, and the collection-process continues, if necessary, for remaining nodes.
When the process has completed for all nodes, information is displayed as follows:

[#collect_info_complete]
image::manage-logging/collectInformationComplete.png[,720,align=left]

As this indicates, a set of log files has been created for each node in the cluster.
Each file is saved as a zip file in the stated temporary location.

[#uploading_log_files]
== Uploading Log Files

Log files can be uploaded to Couchbase, for inspection by Couchbase Support.

For information on performing upload at the command-prompt, see xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[cbcollect_info].
To upload by means of Couchbase Web Console, before starting the collection-process, check the [.ui]*Upload to Couchbase* checkbox:

[#upload_to_couchbase_checkbox]
image::manage-logging/uploadToCouchbaseCheckbox.png[,150,align=left]

The display changes to the following:

[#upload_to_couchbase_dialog_basic]
image::manage-logging/uploadToCouchbaseDialogBasic.png[,520,align=left]

The dialog now features an *Upload to Host* field, which contains the server-location to which the customer-data is uploaded.
Fields are also provided for *Customer Name* (required) and *Ticket Number* (optional).
The *Upload Proxy* field optionally takes the hostname of a remote system, which contains the directory specified by the pathname.

Left-click on the *Start Collection* button.
When collection is complete, the URL of the uploaded zip file is displayed.

[#getting-a-cluster-summary]
== Getting a Cluster Summary

A summary of the cluster's status can be acquired by means of the link at the lower right of the *Collect Information* panel:

image::manage-logging/getClusterSummaryLink.png[,260,align=left]

This brings up the *Cluster Summary Info* dialog:

image::manage-logging/clusterSummaryInfoDialog.png[,420,align=left]

This displayed JSON document, which contains detailed status on the current configuration and status of the entire cluster, can be copied to the clipboard, by left-clicking on the *Copy to Clipboard* button, at the lower left.
This information can then be manually shared with Couchbase Support; either in addition to, or as an alternative to log-collection.

[#understanding_redaction]
== Understanding Redaction

Optionally, log files can be _redacted_.
This means that user-data, considered to be private, is removed.
Such data includes:

* Key/value pairs in JSON documents
* Usernames
* Query-fields that reference key/value pairs and/or usernames
* Names and email addresses retrieved during product registration
* Extended attributes

This redaction of user-data is referred to as _partial_ redaction.
(_Full_ redaction, which will be available in a forthcoming version of Couchbase Server, additionally redacts _meta-data_.)

In each modified log file, hashed text (achieved with SHA1) is substituted for redacted text.
For example, the following log file fragment displays private data — a Couchbase username:

[source,bash]
----
0ms [I0] {2506} [INFO] (instance - L:421) Effective connection string:
couchbase://127.0.0.1?username=Administrator&console_log_level=5&;.
Bucket=default
----

The redacted version of the log file might appear as follows:

[source,bash]
----
0ms [I0] {2506} [INFO] (instance - L:421) Effective connection string:
<UD>e07a9ca6d84189c1d91dfefacb832a6491431e95</UD>.
Bucket=<UD>e16d86f91f9fd0b110be28ad00e348664b435e9e</UD>
----

Note that redaction may eliminate some parameters containing non-private data, as well as all parameters containing private.

Note also that redaction of log files may have one or both of the following consequences:

* Logged issues will be found harder to diagnose, by both the user and Couchbase Support.
* Log-collection is significantly more time-consumptive, since redaction is performed at collection-time.

[#applying_redaction]
== Applying Redaction

Redaction of log files saved on the cluster can be applied as required, when performing _explicit logging_, by means of either `cbcollect_info` or the *Logs* facility of Couchbase Web Console.

For information on performing explicit logging with redaction at the command-prompt, see
xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[cbcollect_info].

To perform explicit logging with redaction by means of Couchbase Web Console, before starting the collection-process, access the *Log Redaction Level* panel, on the *Collect Information* screen.
This features two radio-buttons, labeled *None* and *Partial Redaction*.
Make sure the [.ui]*Partial Redaction* radio-button is selected.
Guidance on redaction is displayed below it:

[#partial_redaction_selection]
image::manage-logging/partialRedactionSelection.png[,682,align=left]

Left-click on the *Start Collection* button.
A notification explains that the collection-process is now running.
When the process has completed, a further notification appears, specifying the location (local or remote) of each created zip file.
Note that, when redaction has been specified, two zip files are provided for each node: one file containing redacted data, the other unredacted data.

[#redacting-log-files-outside-the-cluster]
== Redacting Log Files Outside the Cluster

Certain Couchbase technologies — such as `cbbackupmgr`, the SDK, connectors, and Mobile — create log files saved outside the Couchbase Cluster.
These can be redacted by means of the command-line tool `cblogredaction`.
Multiple log files can be specified simultaneously.
Each file must be specified as plain text.
Optionally, the salt to be used can be automatically generated.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cblogredaction /Users/username/testlog.log -g -o /Users/username -vv
2018/07/17T11:27:06 WARNING: Automatically generating salt. This will make it difficult to cross reference logs
2018/07/17T11:27:07 DEBUG: /Users/username/testlog.log - Starting redaction file size is 19034284 bytes
2018/07/17T11:27:07 DEBUG: /Users/usernae/testlog.log - Log redacted using salt: <ud>COeAtexHB69hGEf3</ud>
2018/07/17T11:27:07 INFO: /Users/username/testlog.log - Finished redacting, 50373 lines processed, 740 tags redacted, 0 lines with unmatched tags
----

For more information, see the corresponding man page, or run the command with the `--h` (help) option.

[#log-file-locations]
== Log File Locations

Couchbase Server creates log files in the following locations.

[cols="1,6"]
|===
| Platform | Location

| Linux
| [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs_

| Windows
| [.path]_C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs_

Assumes default installation location

| Mac OS X
| [.path]_/Users/couchbase/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs_

[#log-file-listing]
== Log File Listing

The following table lists the log files to be found on Couchbase Server.

[cols="7,10"]
|===

| `crash-log.bin`
| Used to pass service crash reports from the babysitter to the `ns_server`.
For example, if the `ns_server` is available, any crash of the babysitter's child is passed directly to the special crash logger service within the `ns_server`.
If the logger service is not attached to the babysiter, then the babysitter saves that crash report to the disk and the `ns_server` can later obtain and log it even if the babysitter is restarted.
This is not a log file in itself.

It is output in common log format and contains several important fields such as remote client IP, timestamp, GET/POST request and resource requested, HTTP status code, and so on.

| `http_access_internal`
| The admin access log records internal server requests (including administrator logins) to the REST API or Couchbase Web Console.
It is output in common log format and contains several important fields such as remote client IP, timestamp, GET/POST request and resource requested, HTTP status code, and so on.

Up to the last _five_ reports are maintained.
Each report is named in accordance with the time it was run: for example, `rebalance_report_2020-03-17T11:10:17Z.json`.
See the xref:rebalance-reference:rebalance-reference.adoc[Rebalance Reference], for detailed information.

| `reports`
| Contains progress and crash reports for the Erlang processes.
Due to the nature of Erlang, processes crash and restart upon an error.

[#log-file-rotation]
== Log File Rotation

The `memcached` log file is rotated whenever memcached is restarted.
Other logs are automatically rotated after they have reached 40MB in size; ten rotations being maintained: the current file, plus nine compressed rotations.

To provide custom rotation-settings for each component, add the following to the `static_config` file:

----
{disk_sink_opts_disk_debug,
        [{rotation, [{size, 10485760},
        {num_files, 10}]}]}.
----

This rotates the `debug.log` at 10MB, and keeps ten copies of the log: the current log and nine compressed logs.

Log rotation settings can be changed.
Note, however, that this is not advised; and that only the default log rotation settings are supported by Couchbase.

[#changing-log-file-locations]
== Changing Log File Locations

The default log location on Linux systems is [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs_.
The location can be changed.
Note, however, that this is not advised; and that only the default log location is supported by Couchbase.

To change the location, proceed as follows:

. Log in as `root` or `sudo` and navigate to the directory where Couchbase Server is installed.
For example: `/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config`.
. Edit the [.path]_static_config_ file: change the `error_logger_mf_dir` variable, specifying a different directory.
For example: `{error_logger_mf_dir, "/home/user/cb/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs"}`
. Stop and restart Couchbase Server. See xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Startup and Shutdown].

[#changing-log-file-levels]
== Changing Log File Levels

The default logging level for all log files is _debug_, except for `couchdb`, which is set to _info_.
Logging levels can be changed.
Note, however, that this is not advised; and that only the default logging levels are supported by Couchbase.

Either _persistent_ or _dynamic_ changes can be made to logging levels.

[#persistent-changes]
=== Persistent Changes

_Persistent_ means that changes continue to be implemented, should a Couchbase Server reboot occur.
To make a persistent change on Linux systems, proceed as follows:

. Log in as `root` or `sudo`, and navigate to the directory where you installed Couchbase.
For example: `/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config`.
. Edit the [.path]_static_config_ file and change the desired log component.
(Parameters with the `loglevel_` prefix establish logging levels.)
. Stop and restart Couchbase Server. See xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Startup and Shutdown].

[#dynamic-changes]
=== Dynamic Changes

_Dynamic_ means that if a Couchbase Server reboot occurs, the changed logging levels revert to the default.
To make a dynamic change, execute a [.cmd]`curl POST` command, using the following syntax:

----
curl -X POST -u adminName:adminPassword HOST:PORT/diag/eval \
              -d ‘ale:set_loglevel(<log_component>,<logging_level>).’
----

* `log_component`: The default log level (except `couchdb`) is `debug`; for example `ns_server`.
The available loggers are `ns_server`, `couchdb`, `user`, `Menelaus`, `ns_doctor`, `stats`, `rebalance`, `cluster`, views, `mapreduce_errors` , xdcr and `error_logger`.
* `logging_level`: The available log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error`.
+
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval \
                -d 'ale:set_loglevel(ns_server,error).
----

[#collecting-logs-using-cli]
== Collecting Logs Using the CLI

To collect logs, use the CLI command
xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[cbcollect_info].

To start and stop log-collection, and to collect log-status, use:

* xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-collect-logs-start.adoc[collect-logs-start]
* xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-collect-logs-stop.adoc[collect-logs-stop]

[#collecting-logs-using-rest]
== Collecting Logs Using the REST API

The Logs REST API provides the endpoints for retrieving log and diagnostic information.

To retrieve log information use the `/diag` and `/sasl_logs`
xref:rest-api:logs-rest-api.adoc[REST endpoints].
