[abstract]
Hard failover allows a node to be removed from a cluster reactively, because the node has become unresponsive or unstable.

[#understanding-hard-failover]
== Understanding Hard Failover

_Hard_ failover drops a node from a cluster _reactively_, because the node has become unresponsive or unstable.
It is manually or automatically initiated, and occurs after the point at which active vBuckets have been lost.

The automatic initiation of hard failover is known as _automatic_ failover, and is configured by means of the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#node-availability[Node Availability] panel of the *General* settings screen of Couchbase Web Console, or by means of equivalent CLI and REST API commands.
The current page explains how to initiate hard failover _manually_.

A complete conceptual description of failover and its variants (including hard) is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/failover.adoc[Failover].

[#examples-on-this-page-hard-failover]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below perform the same _hard_ failover, on the same two-node cluster; using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/failover-hard.adoc#hard-failover-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-nodes/failover-hard.adoc#hard-failover-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/failover-hard.adoc#hard-failover-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively. The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists; as at the conclusion of xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a Cluster and Rebalance].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#hard-failover-with-the-ui]
== Hard Failover with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access the Couchbase Web Console *Servers* screen, on node `10.142.181.101`, by left-clicking on the *Servers* tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
The display is as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]
+
. To see further details of the node to be failed over, which in this example will be `101.142.181.102`, left-click on the row for the node.
The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]

. To initiate failover, left-click on the *Failover* button, at the lower right of the row for `101.142.181.102`:
+
[#failover-button]
image::manage-nodes/failoverButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
The *Confirm Failover Dialog* now appears:
+
[#confirm-failover-dialog]
image::manage-nodes/confirmFailoverDialog.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Two radio buttons are provided, to allow selection of either *Graceful* or *Hard* failover. *Graceful* is selected by default.

. Select _hard_ failover by selecting the *Hard* radio button:
+
[#select-hard-failover]
image::manage-nodes/confirmHardFailoverDialog.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Note the warning message that appears when hard failover is selected: in particular, this points out that hard failover may interrupt ongoing writes and replications, and that therefore it may be better to xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Remove a Node and Rebalance], than use hard failover on a still-available Data Service node.
+
To continue with hard failover, confirm your choice by left-clicking on the *Failover Node* button.
+
Hard failover now occurs.
On conclusion, the *Servers* screen appears as follows:
+
[#cluster-after-hard-failover]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterHardFailover.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that hard failover has successfully completed, but a rebalance is required to complete the reduction of the two-node cluster to one node.
+
. Left-click the *Rebalance* button, at the upper right, to initiate rebalance.
When the process is complete, the *Server* screen appears as follows:
+
[#graceful-failover-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/gracefulFailoverAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]
+
Node `10.142.181.102` has successfully been removed.

Note that if rebalance fails, notifications are duly provided.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#rebalance-failure-notification[Rebalance Failure Notification].
See also the information provided on xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling], and the procedure for its set-up, described in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#rebalance-settings[Rebalance Settings].

[#hard-failover-of-multiple-nodes]
=== Hard Failover of Multiple Nodes

Hard failover of one or more nodes can be managed by means of the *FAILOVER* tab, toward the upper right of the *Servers* screen:

image::manage-nodes/serverScreenWithFailoverTab.png[,800,align=middle]

As the *Servers* screen here shows, this example features a cluster of three nodes.
Left-click on the *FAILOVER* tab to perform hard failover on one or more of the three nodes:

image::manage-nodes/leftClickOnFailoverTab.png[,200,align=middle]

This brings up the *Failover Multiple Nodes* dialog:

image::manage-nodes/hardFailoverMultipleNodesDialog.png[,520,align=middle]

The dialog provides the following *Data Loss Warning*: _For hard failover of multiple nodes, each Couchbase bucket must have at least as many replicas as the total number of nodes failed over or you WILL lose data.
Since hard failover removes nodes immediately it may also result in failure of in-flight operations._

Select one or more nodes from the checkboxes, then left-click on the *Failover Nodes* button, to start hard failover.
When failover has completed, a rebalance will, as usual, be required.

[#hard-failover-with-unresponsive-nodes]
==== Hard Failover of Multiple Unresponsive Nodes

When hard failover is required due to multiple nodes being unresponsive, the *Failover Multiple Nodes* dialog appears as follows:

image::manage-nodes/hardFailoverMultipleNodesUnresponsiveDialog.png[,520,align=middle]

The three unresponsive nodes are those marked, at the left, with a red bar.
If the checkbox for each of these nodes is selected, and the *Failover Nodes* button is left-clicked, the following dialog appears:

image::manage-nodes/hardFailoverDangerDialog.png[,400,align=middle]

This indicates that hard failover of these nodes will be _unsafe_; and should only be attempted if there is no alternative.
For information on the _safe_ and _unsafe_ modes of hard failover, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc#safe-and-unsafe[Hard-Failover Modes: Safe and Unsafe].

[#hard-failover-with-the-cli]
== Hard Failover with the CLI

Hard failover has two modes, which are _safe_ and _unsafe_.
These are described in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc#safe-and-unsafe[Hard-Failover Modes: Safe and Unsafe].

To perform a _safe_ hard failover on a node, use the `failover` command with the `--hard` flag.

----
couchbase-cli failover -c 10.142.181.102:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--server-failover 10.142.181.102:8091 --hard
----

So used, the `--hard` flag specifies that failover be hard and, by default, safe.

When the progress completes successfully, the following output is displayed:

----
SUCCESS: Server failed over
----

The cluster can now be rebalanced with the following command, to remove the failed-over node:

----
couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password --server-remove 10.142.181.102:8091
----

Progress is displayed as console output. If successful, the operation gives the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Rebalance complete
----

Note that in some circumstances, when a  _safe_ hard failover is attempted, Couchbase Server may determine that data loss or other negative consequences would result: such an attempt therefore fails, with an `ERROR: Received unexpected status 504` notification.
In cases where hard failover must nevertheless be performed, the `failover` CLI expression should be re-entered: this time, with the `--force` flag used, in addition to the `--hard` flag.
This produces an unsafe, hard failover.

For more information on `failover` with the CLI, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-failover.adoc[failover].
For more information on `rebalance` with the CLI, see xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance.adoc[rebalance].

[#hard-failover-with-the-rest-api]
== Hard Failover with the REST API

Hard failover has two modes, which are _safe_ and _unsafe_.
These are described in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc#safe-and-unsafe[Hard-Failover Modes: Safe and Unsafe].

To perform a _safe_ hard failover on a node, by means of the REST API, use the `/controller/failover` URI, specifying the node to be failed over, as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/failOver \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.181.102'
----

Note that if multiple nodes are to be failed over, each can be specified separately; using, as here, the `otpNode-ns_1@<ip-address>` format, and the `-d` flag.

Subsequently, the cluster can be rebalanced, and the failed-over node removed, with the `/controller/rebalance` URI:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'ejectedNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.102' \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.101%2Cns_1%4010.142.181.102'
----

For more information on `/controller/failover`, see xref:rest-api:rest-node-failover.adoc[Failing Over Nodes].
For more information on `/controller/rebalance`, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-rebalance.adoc[Rebalancing Nodes].

Note that in some circumstances, when a  _safe_ hard failover is attempted, Couchbase Server may determine that data loss or other negative consequences would result: such an attempt therefore fails, with a `Cannot safely perform a failover at the moment` notification.
In cases where hard failover must nevertheless be performed, the `POST /controller/rebalance` expression should be re-entered, with the same parameters as before; but this time, with the addition of the `-d allowUnsafe=true` parameter.
This produces an unsafe, hard failover.

(Note that a safe, hard failover can be explicitly specified with `-d allowUnsafe=false`: however, since this is the default parameter-value, it does not need to be explicitly specified, for a safe, hard failover to occur.)

[#next-steps-after-hard-failover]
== Next Steps
A node that has been failed over can be recovered and reintegrated into the cluster.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/recover-nodes.adoc[Recover a Node].
