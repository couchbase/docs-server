== Managing Nodes and Clusters

A Couchbase Server _node_ is a physical or virtual machine that hosts a single instance of Couchbase Server.
A conceptual overview is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc[Nodes].
The current section provides step-by-step procedures for node-management.
This includes:

* _Initializing_ and _provisioning_ a node, thereby making it a one-node cluster.
* _Adding_ and _removing_ nodes from clusters.
* _Listing_ nodes currently in the cluster.
* Performing _failover_ on nodes, when they need to be removed from the cluster.
* _Rebalancing_ the cluster, after a node has been removed for scheduled or otherwise planned maintenance.
* _Recovering_ a node, following failover.
* _Applying_ node-to-node encryption, to ensure security of communications across the cluster.

== Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the instructions provided throughout this section, you must have installed and started Couchbase Server.

For links to all per platform installation-instructions, see xref:install:install-intro.adoc[Install].

For information on starting and stopping Couchbase Server on different platforms, see xref:install:startup-shutdown.adoc[Startup and Shutdown].

=== Certificate Management

The examples in this section assume that nodes are protected with the out-of-the-box, _self-signed_ SSL/TLS certificate that is provided with Couchbase Server by default.
This allows nodes to be added to the cluster with no need for explicit certificate-related management; since each node has the same certificate.
However, this certificate is only intended for use in pre-production environments.

If, across the cluster, an _authority-signed_ certificate is substituted for the default (as would be required for production deployments), no further node can subsequently be added until a certificate signed by the same authority has been installed on it.
An attempt incorporate into a cluster a new node that is not appropriately certificate-protected results in an error.
For more information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-certificates[Node Certificates].
