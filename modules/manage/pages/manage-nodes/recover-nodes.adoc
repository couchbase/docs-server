[#understanding-recovery]
== Understanding Recovery

After failover has occurred, before the failed over node has been rebalanced out of the cluster, the node can be _recovered_, and thereby reintegrated into the cluster.
This is useful in circumstances where, following failover, the unhealthy node has been fixed, and is therefore now assumed fit for re-addition.

There are two options for recovery, which are _full_ and _delta_.
These are explained in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/recovery.adoc[Recovery].

[#examples-on-this-page-recover-node]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to perform both _full_ and _delta_ recovery on the same failed over node in the same cluster; using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/recover-nodes.adoc#recover-node-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-nodes/recover-nodes.adoc#recover-node-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/recover-nodes.adoc#recover-node-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively. The examples assume:

The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists, as at the conclusion of xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a Cluster and Rebalance].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#recover-node-with-the-ui]
== Recover a Node with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access the Couchbase Web Console *Servers* screen, on node `10.142.181.101`, by left-clicking on the *Servers* tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
The display is as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]
+
. To see further details of each node, left-click on the row for the node.
The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]

. To initiate failover, left-click on the *Failover* button, at the lower right of the row for `101.142.181.102`:
+
[#failover-button]
image::manage-nodes/failoverButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
The *Confirm Failover Dialog* now appears:
+
[#confirm-failover-dialog]
image::manage-nodes/confirmFailoverDialog.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Two radio buttons are provided, to allow selection of either *Graceful* or *Hard* failover.
*Graceful* is selected by default.

. Confirm _graceful_ failover by left-clicking on the *Failover Node* button.
+
Graceful failover is now initiated.
A progress dialog appears new the top of the screen, summarizing overall progress.
+
For server-level details of the graceful-failover process, see the conceptual overview provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/graceful-failover.adoc[Graceful Failover].
+
When the process ends, the display is as follows:
+
[#graceful-failover-fullscreen-rebalance-needed]
image::manage-nodes/gracefulFailoverFullScreenRebalanceNeeded.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that the graceful failover has successfully completed.
A rebalance is required to complete the reduction of the cluster to one node.
Additionally, the *Add Back: Full Recovery* and *Add Back: Delta Recovery* buttons are displayed, towards the left-hand side of the row:
+
[#full-and-delta-recovery-buttons]
image::manage-nodes/fullAndDeltaRecoveryButtons.png[,440,align=middle]

. Select one of the two available forms of recovery, by left-clicking the corresponding button.
Note that _full_ and _delta_ recovery are described in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/recovery.adoc[Recovery].
If you select _full_, by left-clicking on the *Add Back: Full Recovery* button, the row for `10.142.181.102` is displayed as follows:
+
[#node-row-after-full-recovery-select]
image::manage-nodes/nodeRowAfterFullRecoverySelect.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The row specifies `REBALANCE to finish full recovery`: therefore, left-click the *Rebalance* button to apply full recovery.
+
Similarly, left-clicking on the *Add Back: Delta Recovery* displays `REBALANCE to finish delta recovery`.
Recovery can be aborted, by left-clicking on the *CANCEL ADD BACK* button.

. Left-click on the *Rebalance* button.
Whichever form of recovery you have chosen, _full_ or _delta_, is performed.

Note that if rebalance fails, notifications are duly provided.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#rebalance-failure-notification[Rebalance Failure Notification].
See also the information provided on xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling], and the procedure for its set-up, described in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#rebalance-settings[Rebalance Settings].

[#recover-node-with-the-cli]
== Recover a Node with the CLI

For a node to be recovered with the CLI, it must first be failed over.
Perform graceful failover as documented in
xref:manage:manage-nodes/failover-graceful.adoc#graceful-failover-with-the-cli[Graceful Failover with the CLI], as follows:

----
couchbase-cli failover -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--server-failover 10.142.181.102:8091
----

To recover the failed-over node, use the `recovery` command, in either of the following ways:

* Perform full recovery:
+
----
couchbase-cli recovery -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--server-recovery 10.142.181.102:8091 \
--recovery-type full
----

* Perform delta recovery:
+
----
couchbase-cli recovery -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--server-recovery 10.142.181.102:8091 \
--recovery-type delta
----

Whichever option you have chosen, if it completes successfully, the
command produces the following output:

----
SUCCESS: Servers recovered
----

The server must now be rebalanced back into the cluster, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password
----

During rebalance, progress is displayed as console output:

----
Rebalancing
Bucket: 01/01 (travel-sample)                    60714 docs remaining
[=====                                                        ] 4.56%
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Rebalance complete
----

For more information on `rebalance`, see the command reference at xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance.adoc[rebalance]. For more information on `recover`, see the command reference at xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-recovery.adoc[recovery].

[#recover-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Recover a Node with the REST API

For a node to be recovered with the REST API, it must first be failed over.
Perform graceful failover as documented in xref:manage:manage-nodes/failover-graceful.adoc#graceful-failover-with-the-rest-api[Graceful
Failover with the REST API], as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/startGracefulFailover \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.181.102'
----

Note the naming-convention that must be used to reference the node.
To output the name of each cluster-node in conformance with this convention, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-details.adoc[Viewing Cluster Details].

To recover the failed over node, use the `recovery` command, in either of the following ways:

* Perform full recovery:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/setRecoveryType \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.181.102' \
-d 'recoveryType=full'
----

* Perform delta recovery:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/setRecoveryType \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.181.102' \
-d 'recoveryType=delta'
----

The server must now be rebalanced back into the cluster.
Use the `/controller/rebalance` URI, as follows:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
10.142.181.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1@10.142.181.101,ns_1@10.142.181.102'
----
