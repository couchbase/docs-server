= List Cluster Nodes

[abstract]
The nodes currently included in a cluster can be listed, and details on
each retrieved.

[#listing-nodes]
== Listing Nodes

Couchbase Server allows the nodes currently included in a cluster to be
listed, and data retrieved on each.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-listing]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how the nodes of the
same cluster can be listed, using the
xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc#list-nodes-with-the-ui[UI],
and the
xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc#list-nodes-with-the-rest-api[REST
API] respectively. No node-join is supported by the CLI.

The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists; as at the conclusion of
xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a
Cluster and Rebalance].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of
`Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#list-nodes-with-the-ui]
== List Nodes with the UI

All nodes in the current cluster can be viewed on the *Servers* screen of
Couchbase Web Console. Note that this display is identical for all nodes in
the cluster: therefore, whether you open the console on node one or node two
of a two-node cluster, the same information is provided.

Proceed as follows:

. Access the Couchbase Web Console *Servers* screen, on either
node `10.142.181.101` or node
`101.142.181.102`, by left-clicking on the *Servers* tab in the left-hand
navigation bar. The display is as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that the cluster currently consists of the nodes
`10.142.181.101` and
`101.142.181.102`. Each row provides the following details:

** *name*: The name of the node. In this case, each node is named after
its IP address.

** *group*: The _Group_ occupied by the node. For information, see
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server
Group Awareness].

** *services*: The _services_ running on the node. For information, see
xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services].

** *CPU*: The percentage of available CPU resources currently occupied.

** *RAM*: The percentage of available RAM currently occupied. For information
on Couchbase memory-management, see
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc[Memory].

** *swap*: The percentage of available swap space in use.

** *disk used*: The amount of disk space currently used, in megabytes.

** *items*: The number of _active_ and _replica_ items currently on the node,
in thousands. If the figure is `15.2 K/15.8 K`, this indicates that 15.2 K
items are in active vBuckets on the node, and 15.8 in replica. For information
on vBuckets, see
xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.adoc[vBuckets].

. To see further details of each node, left-click on the row for
the node. The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The additional information now shown includes:

** *Name*, *Version*, *Uptime*, *OS* version, and Data Service *RAM Quota*.

** *Storage Paths* for the Data, Index, and Analytics services, specified
during node-initialization.

** Currently available memory and disk-space.

. Left-click on the `Statistics` tab, and the right-hand side of the row. The
*Statistics* screen is displayed:
+
[#statistics-screen]
image::manage-nodes/statisticsScreen.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The screen provides statistics related each of the buckets on the cluster. These
include general information on
operations; gets, sets, and deletes, read and write failures, and
incoming and outgoing XDCR operations. Specific details are provided for
server resources, vBucket resources, disk and DCP queues, Indexes, and more.
Buckets can be selected from the pull-down menu at the top.

[#list-nodes-with-the-cli]
== List Nodes with the CLI

To list the nodes of a cluster with the CLI, use the `server-list`
command, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli server-list -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password
----

The output is as follows:

----
ns_1@10.142.181.101 10.142.181.101:8091 healthy active
ns_1@10.142.181.102 10.142.181.102:8091 healthy active
----

On occasions when a node is inactive or failed, output of the following kind
is produced:

----
ns_1@10.142.181.101 10.142.181.101:8091 healthy active
ns_1@10.142.181.102 10.142.181.102:8091 healthy inactiveFailed
----

Alternatively, the CLI `host-list` command can be used:

----
couchbase-cli host-list -c 10.142.181.102:8091 --username Administrator --password password
----

Note that the command above specifies the second node in the cluster: any
node-name in the cluster can be used, with the same results. The output is
as follows:

----
10.142.181.101:8091
10.142.181.102:8091
----

Thus, the command returns a list of IP addresses and Couchbase Web
Console port numbers.

For more information, see the command reference for
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-server-list.adoc[server-list] and
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-host-list.adoc[host-list].

[#list-nodes-with-the-rest-api]
== List Nodes with the REST API

To list all nodes in a cluster by means of the REST API, use the
`/pools/default` URI. A Couchbase _pool_ represents computing resources
(such as machines, memory, CPU, and disks) that are used to
host Couchbase buckets. Couchbase Server clusters support
a single pool named `default`.

The method returns a large amount of information, which includes many of
the details used in the Couchbase Web Console `Statics` panel, described
above. The output may be unformatted, and thereby difficult to read until
formatting is applied.

The following call passes the result to the
https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] command-line JSON processor for
formatting, and then uses the standard command-line utility `grep` to
reduce the output to available hostnames:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output is as follows:

----
"hostname": "10.142.181.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.142.181.102:8091",
----

xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-get.adoc[Retrieving Cluster Information].
