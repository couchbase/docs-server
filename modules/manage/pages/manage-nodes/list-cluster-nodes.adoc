= List Cluster Nodes

[abstract]
The nodes of a cluster can be listed, and details on each retrieved.

[#listing-nodes]
== Listing Nodes

Couchbase Server allows the nodes of a cluster to be listed, and data retrieved on each.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-listing]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how the nodes of the same cluster can be listed, using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc#list-nodes-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc#list-nodes-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc#list-nodes-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.

The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists; as at the conclusion of xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a Cluster and Rebalance].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#list-nodes-with-the-ui]
== List Nodes with the UI

All nodes in the current cluster can be viewed on the *Servers* screen of Couchbase Web Console.
Note that this display is identical for all nodes in the cluster: therefore, whether you open the console on node one or node two of a two-node cluster, the same information is provided.

Proceed as follows:

. Access the Couchbase Web Console *Servers* screen, on either node `10.142.181.101` or node `101.142.181.102`, by left-clicking on the *Servers* tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
The display is as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that the cluster currently consists of the nodes `10.142.181.101` and `101.142.181.102`.
Each row provides the following details:

** *name*: The name of the node. In this case, each node is named after its IP address.

** *group*: The _Group_ occupied by the node. For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc[Server Group Awareness].

** *services*: The _services_ running on the node. For information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services].

** *CPU*: The percentage of available CPU resources currently occupied.

** *RAM*: The percentage of available RAM currently occupied.
For information on Couchbase memory-management, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc[Memory].

** *swap*: The percentage of available swap space in use.

** *disk used*: The amount of disk space currently used, in megabytes.

** *items*: The number of _active_ and _replica_ items currently on the node, in thousands.
If the figure is `15.2 K/15.8 K`, this indicates that 15.2 K items are in active vBuckets on the node, and 15.8 in replica.
For information on vBuckets, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/vbuckets.adoc[vBuckets].

. To see further details of each node, left-click on the row for the node.
The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The additional information now shown includes:

** *Name*, *Version*, *Uptime*, *OS* version, and Data Service *RAM Quota*.

** *Storage Paths* for the Data, Index, Eventing, and Analytics services, specified during node-initialization.

** Currently available memory and disk-space.

. Left-click on the `Statistics` tab for 10.142.181.101`, at the right-hand side of the row.
The *Statistics* screen is displayed:
+
[#statistics-screen]
image::manage-nodes/statisticsScreen.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The screen provides statistics related to each of the buckets on the cluster.
These include general information on operations; gets, sets, and deletes, read and write failures, and
incoming and outgoing XDCR operations.
Specific details are provided for server resources, vBucket resources, disk and DCP queues, Indexes, and more.
Buckets can be selected from the pull-down menu at the top.
+

[#list-nodes-with-the-cli]
== List Nodes with the CLI

To list the nodes of a cluster with the CLI, use the `server-list` command, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli server-list -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password
----

The output is as follows:

----
ns_1@10.142.181.101 10.142.181.101:8091 healthy active
ns_1@10.142.181.102 10.142.181.102:8091 healthy active
----

On occasions when a node is inactive or failed, output of the following kind is produced:

----
ns_1@10.142.181.101 10.142.181.101:8091 healthy active
ns_1@10.142.181.102 10.142.181.102:8091 healthy inactiveFailed
----

Alternatively, the CLI `host-list` command can be used:

----
couchbase-cli host-list -c 10.142.181.102:8091 --username Administrator --password password
----

Note that the command above specifies the second node in the cluster: any node-name in the cluster can be used, with the same results.
The output is as follows:

----
10.142.181.101:8091
10.142.181.102:8091
----

Thus, the command returns a list of IP addresses and Couchbase Web Console port numbers.

For more information, see the command reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-server-list.adoc[server-list] and
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-host-list.adoc[host-list].

[#list-nodes-with-the-rest-api]
== List Nodes with the REST API

To list all nodes in a cluster by means of the REST API, use the `/pools/default` URI.
A Couchbase _pool_ represents computing resources (such as machines, memory, CPU, and disks) that are used to
host Couchbase buckets.
Couchbase Server clusters support a single pool, named `default`.

The method returns a large amount of information, which includes many of the details used in the Couchbase Web Console `Statistics` panel, described above.
The output may be unformatted, and thereby difficult to read until formatting is applied.

The following call passes the result to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] command-line JSON processor for
formatting, and then uses the standard command-line utility `grep` to reduce the output to available hostnames:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output is as follows:

----
"hostname": "10.142.181.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.142.181.102:8091",
----

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-get.adoc[Retrieving Cluster Information].
