== Understanding Removal and Rebalance

The _rebalance_ operation distributes active and replica vBuckets across available cluster nodes in optimal fashion.
This allows the best possible data-availability to be maintained after nodes have been added or removed.
Examples of using rebalance after node-addition have already been provided, in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance] and xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a Cluster and Rebalance].
In particular, reference was made in both locations to the data initially resident on a single node being replicated and distributed, across two nodes, following node-addition.

Nodes can also be rebalanced following removal: this is demonstrated in the current section. When a node is flagged for _removal_ (as opposed to _failover_), new replica vBuckets will be created on the remaining nodes, as node-removal occurs.
This has the effect of reducing available memory for the specified number of replicas.

This page provides the steps to be taken for node-removal and rebalance.
For a conceptual explanation of removal, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/removal.adoc[Removal].

[#examples-on-this-page-node-removal]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to remove the same node from the same two-node cluster; using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists; as at the conclusion of xref:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc[List Cluster Nodes].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#remove-a-node-with-the-ui]
== Remove a Node with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access the *Servers* screen of Couchbase Web Console, by means of the *Servers* tab in the left-hand navigation bar.
The screen appears as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]

. Left-click on the row for node `10.142.181.102`. The row expands vertically, as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]

. To initiate removal, left-click on the *Remove* button, at the lower left of the row:
+
[#remove-button]
image::manage-nodes/removeButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
The *Confirm Server Removal* dialog appears:
+
[#confirm-server-removal]
image::manage-nodes/confirmServerRemoval.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Left-click on the *Remove Server* confirmation button. The *Servers* screen reappears as follows:
+
[#folowing-removal]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterFollowingRemoval.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that node `10.142.181.102` has been `flagged for removal`, and is `Still taking traffic`.
A rebalance must be performed to complete removal.

. Left-click on the *Rebalance* button, at the upper right:
+
[#rebalance-button]
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
Rebalancing now occurs.
A dialog appears, providing status on progress.
+
[#rebalance-progress-following-removal]
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceProgressJoinNode.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Following the rebalance, the *Servers* screen confirms that a single node
remains:
+
[#single-node-cluster-before-add-node]
image::manage-nodes/singleNodeClusterBeforeAddNode.png[,800,align=middle]
+
Note that all 31.1 K of *Items* (from the `travel-sample` bucket) are again solely located on `10.142.181.101`, with no replicas (since at least two nodes are required for replication to occur).

Note that if rebalance fails, notifications are duly provided.
These are described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#rebalance-failure-notification[Rebalance Failure Notification].
See also the information provided on xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling], and the procedure for its set-up, described in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#rebalance-settings[Rebalance Settings].

[#remove-a-node-with-the-cli]
== Remove a Node with the CLI

To remove a node from a cluster and perform the necessary rebalance, use the `rebalance` command with the `--server-remove` option:

----
couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.142.181.102:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password --server-remove 10.142.180.102:8091
----

This initiates the rebalance process. As it continues, progress is shown as console output:

----
Rebalancing
Bucket: 01/01 (travel-sample)             0 docs remaining
[================================                 ] 31.67%
----

For more information, see the command reference for
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance.adoc[rebalance].

[#remove-a-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Remove a Node with the REST API

To remove a node from a cluster with the REST API, and rebalance the remaining nodes, use the `/controller/rebalance` URI.
This requires that all known nodes be specified, and that the nodes to be ejected also be specified:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'ejectedNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.102' \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.101%2Cns_1%4010.142.181.102'
----

The command returns no output.

[#next-steps-after-remove-nodes]
== Next Steps

Nodes can be _failed over_, so that an unhealthy or unresponsive node can be removed from the cluster without application-access being affected. See xref:manage:manage-nodes/fail-nodes-over.adoc[Fail Nodes Over].
