= Initialize a Node

[abstract]
A new Couchbase Server node can be _initialized_, to establish node-specific paths for local storage.

[#understanding-initialization]
== Understanding Initialization

Following installation and start-up of Couchbase Server, a node must be:

* _Initialized_, whereby its disk-paths for data, indexes, and analytics are established.

* _Provisioned_, whereby all other details, including Full Administrator credentials, service assignments, and memory quota-definitions are established.

Optionally, _initialization_ can be performed explicitly and independently of provisioning, as a prior process, in order to establish custom disk-paths.
When the node is subsequently provisioned, these are preserved (unless, as is possible with UI-based provisioning, they are optionally overwritten, and the node is thus re-initialized).

If initialization is not explicitly performed, it will occur as part of the eventual provisioning process, and default disk-path values will be applied.

Note that disk-paths cannot be changed after a node has been _provisioned_, and has thus either become a cluster of one node, or has been added to a cluster of other nodes.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-initialization]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to initialize the same node; using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/initialize-node.adoc#initialize-a-node-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/initialize-node.adoc#initialize-a-node-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
Note that UI-based initialization only be performed as part of the overall _provisioning_ process.

The examples assume:

* Couchbase Server has been installed and started.

* The IP address of the node is `10.142.181.103`.

== Initialize a Node with the CLI

To initialize a node with the CLI, use the `node-init` command, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli node-init -c 10.142.181.103 \
-u placeholdername -p placeholderpwd \
--node-init-data-path /home/vagrant/dpath \
--node-init-index-path /home/vagrant/ipath \
--node-init-analytics-path /home/vagrant/apath
----

This initializes the disk-paths for data, indexes, and analytics on node `10.142.181.103` to the values shown.
Note that the command requires that a username and password be specified, although the node has not yet been provisioned with credentials. Placeholders are therefore provided: these can be overwritten during subsequent provisioning.

If successful, the operation returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Node initialized
----

For more information, see the reference for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-node-init.adoc[node-init] command.

[#initialize-a-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Initialize a Node with the REST API

To initialize a node with the REST API, use the '/nodes/self/controller/settings' URI, as follows:
----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.103:8091/nodes/self/controller/settings \
-d 'path=/home/vagrant/dpath' \
-d 'index_path=/home/vagrant/ipath' \
-d 'cbas_path=/home/vagrant/apath'
----

This initializes the disk-paths for data, indexes, and analytics on node `10.142.181.103` to the values shown.

For more information on `/nodes/self/controller/settings`, see xref:rest-api:rest-node-provisioning.adoc[Creating a New Cluster].

[#next-steps-after-initializing]
== Next Steps

Following initialization, a node can be _provisioned_ so as to become a Couchbase Cluster of one node.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for details.
