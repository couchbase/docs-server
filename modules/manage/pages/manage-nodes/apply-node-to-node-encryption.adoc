= Apply Node-to-Node Encryption

[abstract]
Network traffic between the individual nodes of a Couchbase-Server cluster can be encrypted, in order to optimize cluster-internal security.

== Understanding Node-to-Node Encryption

Couchbase Server supports _node-to-node encryption_, whereby network traffic between the individual nodes of a cluster is encrypted.
Both the IPV4 and IPV6 address-families are supported, as is the ability to switch the cluster between them.

Node-to-node encryption is managed by means of the Couchbase CLI.
This page provides a sequence of calls, to exemplify how a cluster can be optionally transitioned from one address-family to another, and then secured by means of node-to-node encryption.
For a complete conceptual overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-to-node-encryption[Node-to-Node Encryption].

== Set Up Node-to-Node Encryption

The following sequence demonstrates how to set up node-to-node encryption for a cluster, using the Couchbase CLI.
The sequence assumes:

* The reader's familiarity with the information provided at xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-to-node-encryption[Node-to-Node Encryption].

* A pre-existing cluster of two nodes, `node1-devcluster.com` and `node2-devcluster.com`, both running Couchbase Enterprise Server Version 6.5.

* The cluster's initial use of the IPV6 address-family.

* Node-to-node encryption initially disabled.

* Auto-failover initially enabled.

Proceed as follows:

. Turn off auto-failover.
Use the `setting-autofailover` CLI command, as follows
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-autofailover \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable-auto-failover 0
----
+
The value of `0` assigned to the `--enable-auto-failover` flag specifies that auto-failover be switched off.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----

. Ensure that the IP family of the cluster is the right one for your needs: either IPV4 or IPV6. To set the family, use the `change-ip-family` CLI command:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli change-ip-family \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--ipv4
----
+
The `--set` flag indicates that an IP-family setting is to be made.
The `--ipv4` flag specifies that the cluster will from this point use the IPV4 family.
+
If successful, the command provides the following output:
+
----
Switched ip family for node: http://node1-devcluster.com:8091
Switched ip family for node: http://node2-devcluster.com:8091
SUCCESS: Switched ip family of the cluster
----
+
The output indicates that the IP family has been successfully established, and thus changed for each cluster in the node.

. Enable node-to-node encryption for the cluster.
Use the `change-cluster-encryption` CLI command:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli change-cluster-encryption \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable
----
+
The `--enable` flag enables node-to-node encryption for the cluster, at the default level of `control`.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
Turned on encryption for node: http://node1-devcluster.com:8091
Turned on encryption for node: http://node2-devcluster.com:8091
SUCCESS: Switched cluster encryption on
----
+
The output indicates that encryption has been successfully enabled for each node in the cluster.

. Establish an appropriate encryption-level for the cluster.
This is achieved by the `setting-security` CLI command, specifying the `--cluster-encryption-level` parameter.
Its value can be either control (meaning that only server-management information is passed in encrypted form) or all (meaning that all information, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form):
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--cluster-encryption-level all
----
+
Passed as the value for the `--cluster-encryption-level` flag, `all` is specified as the new encryption-level for the cluster.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

. Switch auto-failover back on, using the `setting-autofailover` command:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-autofailover \
-c node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable-auto-failover 1 \
--auto-failover-timeout 120 \
--enable-failover-of-server-groups 1 \
--max-failovers 2 \
--can-abort-rebalance 1
----
+
The parameter values specify that auto-failover be enabled with a timeout of 120 seconds; with a maximum of two, sequential automated failovers able to occur, prior to administrator intervention being required.
Automated failover of server groups is enabled, as is the aborting of rebalance.
+
If the command succeeds, and the settings are successfully modified, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----


. Confirm that node-to-node encryption is enabled, using the `--get` parameter to `change-cluster-encryption`:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli change-cluster-encryption \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
Cluster encryption is enabled
----

. Confirm the established encryption-level, using the `--get` parameter to `setting-security`:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get
----
+
If successful, the command returns a JSON document whose contents include information on the cluster's _UI disablement settings_, and also confirms that the encryption-level has been established as _all_:
+
----
{"disableUIOverHttp": false, "disableUIOverHttps": false, "clusterEncryptionLevel": "all"}
----
+
For information on UI disablement, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access].

. Confirm the established IP-address family, using the `--get` parameter to `change-ip-family`:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli change-ip-family \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get
----
+
The command returns output confirming the IP-family currently used, which is in this case IPV4:
+
----
Cluster using ipv4
----

This concludes the sequence of commands.
