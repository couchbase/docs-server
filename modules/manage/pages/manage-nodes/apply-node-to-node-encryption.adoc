== Understanding Node-to-Node Encryption

Couchbase Server supports _node-to-node encryption_, whereby network traffic between the individual nodes of a cluster is encrypted.

Node-to-node encryption is managed by means of the Couchbase CLI.
This page provides a sequence of calls, to exemplify how a cluster can be secured by means of node-to-node encryption.
For a complete conceptual overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-to-node-encryption[Node-to-Node Encryption].

[#set-up-node-to-node-encryption]
== Set Up Node-to-Node Encryption

The following sequence demonstrates how to set up node-to-node encryption for a cluster, using the Couchbase CLI.
The sequence assumes:

* The reader's familiarity with the information provided at xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-to-node-encryption[Node-to-Node Encryption].

* A pre-existing cluster of two nodes, `node1-devcluster.com` and `node2-devcluster.com`, both running Couchbase Enterprise Server Version 6.5.

* Node-to-node encryption initially disabled.

* Auto-failover initially enabled.

Note that node-to-node encryption-enablement can also be performed when a cluster is being created.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster].

Proceed as follows:

. Turn off auto-failover.
Use the `setting-autofailover` CLI command, as follows
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-autofailover \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable-auto-failover 0
----
+
The value of `0` assigned to the `--enable-auto-failover` flag specifies that auto-failover be switched off.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----

. Enable node-to-node encryption for the cluster.
Use the `node-to-node-encryption` CLI command:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli node-to-node-encryption \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable
----
+
The `--enable` flag enables node-to-node encryption for the cluster, at the default level of `control`.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
Turned on encryption for node: http://node1-devcluster.com:8091
Turned on encryption for node: http://node2-devcluster.com:8091
SUCCESS: Switched cluster encryption on
----
+
The output indicates that encryption has been successfully enabled for each node in the cluster.

. Establish an appropriate encryption-level for the cluster.
This is achieved by the `setting-security` CLI command, specifying the `--cluster-encryption-level` parameter.
Its value can be either control (meaning that only server-management information is passed in encrypted form) or all (meaning that all information, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form):
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--set \
--cluster-encryption-level all
----
+
Passed as the value for the `--cluster-encryption-level` flag, `all` is specified as the new encryption-level for the cluster.
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Security settings updated
----

. Switch auto-failover back on, using the `setting-autofailover` command:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-autofailover \
-c node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--enable-auto-failover 1 \
--auto-failover-timeout 120 \
--enable-failover-of-server-groups 1 \
--max-failovers 2 \
--can-abort-rebalance 1
----
+
The parameter values specify that auto-failover be enabled with a timeout of 120 seconds; with a maximum of two, sequential automated failovers able to occur, prior to administrator intervention being required.
Automated failover of server groups is enabled, as is the aborting of rebalance.
+
If the command succeeds, and the settings are successfully modified, the following output is displayed:
+
----
SUCCESS: Auto-failover settings modified
----


. Confirm that node-to-node encryption is enabled, using the `--get` parameter to `node-to-node-encryption`:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli node-to-node-encryption \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get
----
+
If the command is successful, the following output is displayed:
+
----
Node-to-node encryption is enabled
----

. Confirm the established encryption-level, using the `--get` parameter to `setting-security`.
Note that this call his here piped to the http://stedolan.github.io/[jq] program, to optimize output-readability:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-security \
-c http://node1-devcluster.com:8091 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--get | jq '.'
----
+
If successful, the command returns a JSON document that contains the current security settings for the cluster.
The first part of the output may be as follows:
+
----
{
  "disableUIOverHttp": false,
  "disableUIOverHttps": false,
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1",
  "cipherSuites": [],
  "honorCipherOrder": true,
  "clusterEncryptionLevel": "all",
  "data": {
    "supportedCipherSuites": [
      "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
      "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
      "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
      "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
            .
            .
            .
----
+
These contents include information on the cluster's _UI disablement settings_, _TLS minimum version_, and _ciper suites_ (listed per service).
The output also contains the current encryption-level setting; which is here shown as _all_:
+
For information on UI disablement, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access].

This concludes the sequence of commands.
