[#understanding-node-addition]
== Understanding Node-Addition

_Full_ and _Cluster_ administrators can use the UI, CLI, or REST API to add Couchbase Server nodes to existing clusters.
On each node to be added, Couchbase Server must have been _installed and started_.
The process of node-addition grants to the new node the settings already established for the parent cluster.
(See xref:manage:manage-settings/manage-settings.adoc[Manage Settings] for details.)
The process allows services to be assigned to the new node.
If the new node was previously _initialized_ with custom disk-paths, these can either be retained or modified.
All aspects of _provisioning_ that may previously have occurred on the new node are eliminated: this includes buckets, services, and settings.

Following node-addition, _rebalance_ is required, to make the new node an active member of the cluster.

=== Node-Addition and Certificate-Management

The examples on this page assume that the default, _system-generated_ certificates provided by Couchbase Server continue to be resident on the cluster and the node to be added.
In a production or similar context, to ensure security, only administrator-configured certificates should be used on a cluster: these should rely on a well known _Certificate Authority_, whose certificate is loaded as the cluster's _root_ certificate.
(For more information, see xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#server-certificates[Default Certificates and Certificate Substitution].)

In such a context, no node can be added to the cluster until conformant administrator-configured certificates have been loaded onto it -- such activities will thus need to be performed in addition to those shown by the examples on this page.

For more information, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc#adding-new-nodes[Adding and Joining New Nodes].
A complete overview of Couchbase-Server certificate-management is provided in xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].

[#examples-on-this-page-node-addition]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to add the same node to the same one-node cluster; using the xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#add-a-node-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#add-a-node-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#add-a-node-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* A one-node cluster already exists; and is named after its IP address: `10.142.181.101`.
It is running the Data, Query, and Index services, and has the `travel-sample` bucket installed.
(To access and install this, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].)

* A new node has been started.
This is named after its IP address: `10.142.181.102`.
It has not been initialized or provisioned.

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* The cluster is protected by the default Couchbase-Server certificate-configuration.

[#add-a-node-with-the-ui]
== Add a Node and Rebalance with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Bring up Couchbase Web Console, and log into cluster `10.142.181.101`, using the Full Administrator username and password.
Access the *Servers* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar:
+
[#left_click_on_servers_tab]
image::manage-nodes/accessServersTab.png[,90,align=middle]
+
The *Servers* screen for the cluster is now displayed:
+
[#servers-screen-initial]
image::manage-nodes/singleNodeClusterBeforeAddNode.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This shows the name of the only node currently in the cluster, `10.142.181.101`, plus additional information, including the services hosted.

. Ensure that the node to be added has been started.
This can be accomplished by checking the IP address and port number for the new node in the address bar of the browser.
The following interface is displayed:
+
[#new-node-welcome-screen]
image::manage-nodes/newNodeWelcomeScreen.png[,400,align=middle]
+
This indicates that Couchbase Server is installed and running on the new node, but has not yet been provisioned.
Do not use this interface: instead, return to Couchbase Web Console for the cluster, `10.142.181.101`.

. In the *Servers* panel for the cluster, left-click on the *ADD SERVER* button, at the upper right:
+
[#add-server-button]
image::manage-nodes/addServerButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
The *Add Server Node* dialog is now displayed:
+
[#add-server-node-dialog]
image::manage-nodes/addServerNodeDialog.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Note the warning provided at the top of the dialog: if the node to be added has already been provisioned, the results of such provisioning will be eliminated and replaced on the node's addition to the current cluster.
(In fact, the node to be added in this example, has neither been initialized nor provisioned.)

. Specify the IP address of the node to be added.
A placeholder password must be specified, even though the node has not yet been provisioned with one.
Uncheck all of the *Services* check-boxes except *Data*.
The dialog now appears as follows:
+
[#add-server-node-dialog-complete]
image::manage-nodes/addServerNodeDialogComplete.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Optionally, the *Customize disk storage paths (this node)* checkbox can be checked, to display interactive fields that allow such paths to be modified for the node that is to be added:
+
[#check-disk-storage-checkbox]
image::manage-nodes/checkDiskStorageCheckbox.png[,280,align=middle]
+
The dialog is now extended vertically, to display the interactive fields for *Data*, *Indexes*, and *Analytics* data paths:
+
[#add-server-dialog-vertically-extended]
image::manage-nodes/addServerNodeDialogVerticallyExtended.png[,400,align=middle]
+
For the current example, the displayed, default paths do not need to be modified.
+
Left-click on the *Add Server* button to save the settings.
The *Servers* screen is redisplayed, with the following appearance:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterAddNodeExpanded.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that the new node, `10.142.181.102` has been successfully added.
However, it is not yet taking traffic, and will be added following a _rebalance_. Note, at this point, the figure under the *Items* column for for `10.142.181.101`: this is `63.1 K/0`, which indicates that the node contains 63.1 K items in _active_ vBuckets, and 0 items in _replica_ vBuckets.
Meanwhile, the *Items* figure for `10.142.181.102` is 0/0, indicating that no items are yet distributed onto that node in either active or replica form.
+
For an architectural description of how vBuckets and their items are distributed across a cluster, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster Replication].

. To perform a rebalance, left-click on the *Rebalance* button, at the upper right:
+
[#rebalance-button]
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
[#rebalance-progress-add-node]
The new node is rebalanced into the cluster, meaning that whatever active and replica vBuckets were previously distributed across the original cluster nodes are redistributed across the superset of nodes created by the addition.
Additionally, a *Rebalance* dialog is displayed:
+
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceInOfNodeTwo6.5v2.png[,800,align=middle]
+
The dialog indicates rebalance progress for each of the services on the cluster.
To see more information on the progress related to the Data Service, left-click on the *travel-sample* tab, under *Data*:
The pane expands to provide additional information on the progress of data-transfer for the *travel-sample* bucket:
+
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceOpenedDataTabfor7.0.png[,430,align=middle]
+
The dialog indicates the progress of both vBuckets and documents, as they are moved between nodes.
Average times for *Views Compaction* are also provided.
+
A new panel now appears at the bottom of the *Servers* screen.
This also reports rebalance progress:
+
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceProgressFooter.png[,760,align=middle]
+
[#rebalance-complete-dialog-appearance]
When the rebalance is complete, the panel at the bottom of the screen disappears, and the dialog appears as follows:
+
image::manage-nodes/rebalanceCompletion7.0.png[,430,align=middle]
+
Note that time-completion figures are also provided for the other services, *Index* and *Query*.
Additionally, a complete report on the concluded rebalance activity can be downloaded, by left-clicking on the *Download Report* button:
+
[#download-button]
image::manage-nodes/downloadButton.png[,180,align=middle]
+
See the xref:rebalance-reference:rebalance-reference.adoc[Rebalance Reference], for information on the contents of the report.
+
Left-click on the *X* at the upper-right of the dialog, to dismiss the dialog.
+
The *Servers* screen now displays two rows &#8212; one each for servers `10.142.181.101` and `10.142.181.102`.
Left-click on the row for `10.142.181.102`, to open it.
The screen now appears as follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::manage-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]
+
Note that the figure in the *Items* column for node `10.142.181.101` is `31.5 K/31.6 K`, which indicates that 31.5 K items are stored on the node in _active_ vBuckets, and 31.6 K in _replica_ vBuckets.
The figure for `10.142.181.102` indicates the converse.
Therefore, replication has successfully distributed the contents of `travel-sample` across both nodes, providing a single replica vBucket for each active vBucket.

[#node-information-within-the-ui]
==== Node Information Within the UI

When the row for a node is open, as is the case here for `10.142.181.102`, information on the node is displayed immediately under its *name*:

* *Addresses* provides at a minimum the _internal_ IP address of the node; and also lists _external_ (that is, _alternate_) IP addresses, if they have been defined &#8212; see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#alternate-addresses[Alternate Addresses], for information.

* The *Address Family* of the node is specified as either *IPv4* or *IPv6*: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/manage-address-families.adoc[Manage Address Families], for information.

* *Node-to-Node Encryption* for the cluster is specified as either *enabled* or *disabled*: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption].

* The *Version* of the Couchbase-Server instance on the node, its current *Uptime*, and the *OS* on which it runs are also specified.

* The *RAM Quotas* for each service on the node, and each established *Storage Path* (for one or more of *Data*, *Indexes*, *Eventing*, and *Analytics*) are specified: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for examples of how to establish these.

[#rebalance-failure-notification]
=== Rebalance Failure Notification

If rebalance fails &#8212; for example, due to a node's becoming non-responsive &#8212; Couchbase Web Console displays a notification such as the following:

image::manage-nodes/rebalanceFailureNotification.png[,250,align=middle]

As this indicates, detailed information can be found by left-clicking on the *Logs* tab, in the left-hand, vertical navigation bar.
This brings up the *Logs* screen, containing information such as the following:

image::manage-nodes/rebalanceFailureLog.png[,800,align=middle]

Information is also provided on the *Rebalance* dialog:

image::manage-nodes/rebalanceDialogFailureNotification.png[,400,align=middle]

If an unresponsive node become responsive again, rebalance can simply be reattempted manually.
Alternatively, the handling of a rebalance-failure can be configured to occur automatically, as described immediately xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[below].

Before attempting rebalance with a reduced number of nodes, assess whether the available resources can support the intended number of replicas.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/removal.adoc[Removal], for guidance.

[#automated-rebalance-failure-handling]
=== Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling

The handling of a rebalance-failure can be configured to occur automatically.
Configuration occurs by means of the *General* settings screen.
Up to 3 _retries_ can be configured.
Each retry occurs after the elapsing of a time-period specified by the administrator, in seconds.
By default, automated rebalance-failure handling is _not_ enabled.
For detailed information, see xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#rebalance-settings[Rebalance Settings].

If automated rebalance-failure handling has been enabled (meaning that between 1 and 3 retries have been specified), following a rebalance failure, the following notifications appear at the lower left of the main screen of Couchbase Web Console:

image::manage-nodes/rebalanceFailureMessage.png[,260,align=middle]

The middle notification indicates that a retry is planned, in accordance with the configuration made on the *General* settings screen.
The displayed integer represents the number of seconds remaining before the retry is commenced; and is gradually decremented, from the configured maximum to zero; at which point, retry is commenced.

If a retry fails, additional retries occur successively; until the maximum configured number have been attempted.

[#retry-cancellation]
=== Retry-Cancellation

If one or more retries have been configured, and, following a rebalance failure, a retry is pending, no administrative tasks should be performed on the cluster.
Instead, _either_ allow configured retries continue occurring &#8212; until one has succeeded, or all have failed; _or_ cancel the entire retry sequence.
Then, continue performing administrative tasks as appropriate.

To cancel, left-click on the *CANCEL RETRY* link, on the retry notification.
Note that this cancels *all* currently scheduled retries.
However, the configured number of retries will be rescheduled for each subsequent, manually initiated rebalance.

Retries can also be cancelled by means of the CLI and the REST API.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#cancel-retries-with-the-cli[Cancel Retries with the CLI] and xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#cancel-retries-with-the-rest-api[Cancel Retries with the REST API], below.

[#add-a-node-with-the-cli]
== Add a Node and Rebalance with the CLI

To add a new Couchbase Server-node to an existing cluster, use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-server-add.adoc[server-add] command.
Note that this command requires that arguments be provided for its `--server-add-username` and `--server-add-password` flags.
In this case, meaningful arguments do not exist, since the new node features an instance of Couchbase Server that is running, but has not been provisioned with a username or password.
Therefore, specify placeholder arguments.
Additionally, specify that the `data` service be run on the node, once it is part of the cluster.

Note that the server to be added should be prefixed with an appropriate _scheme_ (_ie_, `http://` or `https://`): if none is specified, `https://` is used as the default.

----
couchbase-cli server-add -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password \
--server-add http://10.142.181.102:8091 \
--server-add-username someName \
--server-add-password somePassword \
--services data
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Server added
----

The newly added node must now be rebalanced into the cluster. Use the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance.adoc[rebalance] command:

----
couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.142.181.101:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password
----

During rebalance, progress is displayed as console output:

----
Rebalancing
Bucket: 01/01 (travel-sample)                      60714 docs remaining
[=====                                                          ] 4.56%
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Rebalance complete
----

Note that when the operation is highly complex, it may be desirable to get status on its progress, or stop the operation. See the command reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance-status.adoc[rebalance-status] and xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance-stop.adoc[rebalance-stop], for more information.

[#cancel-retries-with-the-cli]
=== Cancel Retries with the CLI

_Retries_ (described above, in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling]) can be cancelled with the CLI, by means of the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-rebalance.adoc[setting-rebalance] command.

Note that use of `setting-rebalance` for setting and getting the current rebalance-failure configuration is documented in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General Settings].

If, following a rebalance failure, a retry is pending, retrieve information on the pending retry as follows.
Note that the command is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] program, to facilitate readability:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-rebalance \
-c 10.143.192.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--pending-info | jq '.'
----

This returns the following object:

----
{
  "retry_rebalance": "pending",
  "rebalance_id": "29d89aa757097523898588c28efd3b4a",
  "type": "rebalance",
  "attempts_remaining": 2,
  "retry_after_secs": 184,
  "known_nodes": [
    "ns_1@10.143.192.101",
    "ns_1@10.143.192.103"
  ],
  "eject_nodes": [],
  "delta_recovery_buckets": "all"
}
----

The output indicates that a `retry_rebalance` is `pending`, and indicates that the `rebalance_id` for the pending retry is `29d89aa757097523898588c28efd3b4a`.
This id can be used to cancel the current retry sequence.
The output also indicates that 2 further retries are scheduled to be made, if necessary; and the `184` seconds remain before the next retry starts.
The nodes in the cluster are listed.
None is specified to be ejected.
All buckets are selected for `delta` recovery.

The current rebalance sequence can be cancelled by means of the `setting-rebalance` command, specifying the retrieved `rebalance_id`.
Enter the following:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli setting-rebalance \
-c 10.143.192.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--cancel \
--rebalance-id 29d89aa757097523898588c28efd3b4a
----

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Rebalance retry canceled
----

[#add-a-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Add a Node and Rebalance with the REST API

To add a new Couchbase Server-node to an existing cluster, use the `/controller/addNode` URI.
The following command adds node `10.142.181.102` to cluster `10.142.181.101`:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
10.142.181.101:8091/controller/addNode \
-d 'hostname=10.142.181.102&user=someName&password=somePassword&services=kv'
----

Note that the argument passed for `services` is `kv`, which signifies the Data Service.
Optionally, other services can be specified: `index` (Index Service), `n1ql` (Query Service), `eventing` (Eventing Service), `fts` (Search Service), and `cbas` (Analytics Service).
If multiple services are specified, this should be as a comma-separated list: for example, `n1ql,index,fts`.
As with the CLI command shown above, a username and password are expected, even though in this case, the new node has not been provisioned: therefore, placeholders are used. If successful, the command returns the name of the newly added node:

----
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.142.181.102"}
----

The newly added node must now be rebalanced into the cluster. Use the `/controller/rebalance` URI, as follows:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
10.142.181.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1@10.142.181.101,ns_1@10.142.181.102'
----

Note that the `knownNodes` argument lists each of the nodes in the cluster.
If successful, the command returns no output.

For further information on adding nodes with the REST API, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-addnodes.adoc[Adding Nodes to Clusters]; on rebalancing, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-rebalance.adoc[Rebalancing the Cluster].

[#cancel-retries-with-the-rest-api]
=== Cancel Retries with the REST API

_Retries_ (described above, in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance-Failure Handling]) can be cancelled with the REST API.

Note that use of the REST API for setting and getting the current rebalance-failure configuration is documented in xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#rebalance-settings-via-rest[Rebalance Settings via REST].

If, following a rebalance failure, a retry is pending, use the `GET /pools/default/pendingRetryRebalance` http method and URI to identify the pending retry, as follows.
Note that this example uses the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] tool, to facilitate readability of output.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/pendingRetryRebalance | jq '.'
----

The output is as follows:

----
{
  "retry_rebalance": "pending",
  "rebalance_id": "ff5845cdce693db2dce9a9308cbf885d",
  "type": "rebalance",
  "attempts_remaining": 2,
  "retry_after_secs": 291,
  "known_nodes": [
    "ns_1@10.143.192.101",
    "ns_1@10.143.192.103"
  ],
  "eject_nodes": [],
  "delta_recovery_buckets": "all"
}
----

This indicates that the status of `retry_rebalance` is `pending`; and provides a `rebalance_id` for the process, of `ff5845cdce693db2dce9a9308cbf885d`.
This id can be used to cancel the retry.
The output also lists the cluster's nodes, indicates that `2` retry attempts are scheduled to occur if necessary after the current one, and indicates that `291` seconds are still to elapse before the pending retry.

To cancel the pending retry, use the `POST /controller/cancelRebalanceRetry` http method and URI, specifying the retrieved `rebalance_id` as the endpoint:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/controller/cancelRebalanceRetry/ff5845cdce693db2dce9a9308cbf885d
----

If successful, this produces a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` success message.
Subsequently, the `GET /pools/default/pendingRetryRebalance` http method and URI can again be used, to verify that there is no longer a retry pending.
This would be indicated by the following output:

----
{
  "retry_rebalance": "not_pending"
}
----

All scheduled retries have thus been successfully cancelled.

Note that reference pages for these commands are provided at xref:rest-api:rest-get-rebalance-retry.adoc[Get Rebalance-Retry Status] and xref:rest-api:rest-cancel-rebalance-retry.adoc[Cancel Rebalance Retries].

[#next-steps-after-adding-and-rebalancing]
== Next Steps

As well as supporting a cluster's adding a node to itself, Couchbase Server also supports a node's joining itself to a cluster (which is essentially the same operation, but proceeding from the node, rather than from the cluster).
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a Cluster and Rebalance] for details.
