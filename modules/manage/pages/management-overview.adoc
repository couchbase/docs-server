A Couchbase Cluster can be created and managed by means of the Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, and the REST API.

[#cluster-management]
== Cluster Management

A Couchbase _cluster_ consists of one or more _nodes_, which are network-accessible systems each running an instance of Couchbase Server.
The nodes are _added_ to the cluster, one by one.
From this point, _buckets_ can be defined on the cluster, to store data items.
_Logs_ can be maintained, _settings_ adjusted, _backup_ scheduled, _security_ measures applied, and _Cross Data Center Replication_ (XDCR) performed, to ensure availability of data.

The pages in this section provide examples of how to perform all key Couchbase Server management tasks, using all available tools.

[#couchbase-server-tools]
== Couchbase Server Tools

Couchbase Server can be managed by means of _Couchbase Web Console_, the _Command-Line Interface_ (CLI), and the _REST API_.

The CLI and REST API both allow the IP address of a Couchbase Server-node to be specified, so that the target server is identified on the network.
Both the CLI and REST API can be used in administrator-created scripts and programs, as well as on the command-line.

Couchbase Web Console is browser-based, and allows administrator-authentication at a login screen.
Once granted access, the Full Administrator can view all nodes in the cluster; including details of assigned services, memory quotas, statistics, and more.
(Such information can also be returned by specific CLI and REST calls.)

Couchbase Server enforces _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC), whereby all users are assigned _roles_ that correspond to _privileges_ on system-resources.
Credentials must therefore be passed with each CLI or REST call.
Within Couchbase Web Console, features are made available based on the assigned roles of the authenticated user.
See xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles] for detailed information.

Note that Couchbase Web Console and CLI are themselves based on the REST API.
By using the CLI with the `-d` (debug) option, the underlying REST method can be revealed in standard output.
_Developer Tools_ provided by a browser such as _Chrome_ likewise show ongoing REST calls, while Couchbase Web Console is in use.
