== Cluster Management

A Couchbase _cluster_ consists of one or more _nodes_, which are network-accessible systems each running an instance of Couchbase Server.
The nodes are _added_ to the cluster, one by one.
From this point, _buckets_ can be defined on the cluster, to store data items.
_Logs_ can be maintained, _security_ measures applied, and _Cross Data Center Replication_ (XDCR) performed, to ensure availability of data.

A Couchbase cluster can be established and managed by means of Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, and the REST API.
Examples are provided throughout this section, of how to manage nodes, buckets, and other resources, using all three tools.

The subsections below assume an understanding of the resources to be managed.
See the xref:learn:architecture-overview.adoc[Architecture Overview] of available conceptual and architectural information.
