[#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr-reference]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to delete a replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc[Delete a Replication].

[#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui]
== Delete an XDCR Reference with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the left-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=middle]
+
This brings up the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The upper panel, *Remote Clusters*, features a single reference, as follows:
+
[#xdcr-replications-screen-with-reference]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-replications-screen-with-reference.png[,800,align=middle]

. To delete the reference, left-click on the row for the reference.
When the *Delete* button appears, left-click on it:
+
[#left-click-on-delete-reference-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-delete-replication-tab.png[,120,align=middle]
+
The following confirmation dialog is now displayed:
+
[#xdcr-confirm-delete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-confirm-delete-reference.png[,280,align=middle]

. Left-click on *Delete Reference*, to confirm.
The *Remote Clusters* panel now reappears, showing no replications:
+
[#xdcr-remote-clusters-panel-no-references]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-replications-screen-initial.png[,800,align=left]

The reference has now been deleted.

[#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli]
== Delete an XDCR Reference with the CLI

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr-reference[Examples on This Page], use the `xdcr-setup` command to delete an XDCR reference, specifying the `--delete` and `--xdcr-cluster-name` flags, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--delete \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.102
----

If successful, this returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Cluster reference deleted
----

The reference has been deleted.

[#delete-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api]
== Delete an XDCR Reference with the REST API

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr-reference[Examples on This Page], use the REST API to delete an XDCR reference as follows:

----
curl -X DELETE -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102
----

If successful, this returns `"ok"`: the reference has been deleted.
