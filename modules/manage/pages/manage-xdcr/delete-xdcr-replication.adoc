[#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to delete a replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a Replication].

[#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Delete an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel features an *Outgoing Replications* panel that currently has the following appearance:
+
[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-with-replication]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication.png[,800,align=left]
+
This features information on a single, currently defined replication.
In the `status` column, this replication is shown to be `Replicating`.

. To delete the replication, left-click on the row for the replication.
When the `Delete` button appears, left-click on it:
+
[#left-click-on-delete-replication-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-delete-replication-tab.png[,120,align=middle]
+
The following confirmation dialog is now displayed:
+
[#xdcr-confirm-delete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-confirm-delete.png[,280,align=middle]
+
Left-click on *Delete Replication*, to confirm.
The *Outgoing Replications* panel now reappears, showing no replications:
+
[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-after-deletion]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-initial.png[,800,align=middle]

The replication has now been deleted.

[#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Delete an XDCR Replication with the CLI

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr-replication[Examples on This Page], use the `xdcr-replicate` command to delete an XDCR replication as follows.

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--delete \
--xdcr-replicator=570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/travel-sample/travel-sample
----

The value specified for the `--xdcr-replicator` flag is that retrieved by means of the `--list` flag, shown in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[Pause an XDCR Replication with the CLI].
The `--delete` flag signifies that the replication is to be deleted.
If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication deleted
----

[#delete-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Delete an XDCR Replication with the REST API

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-delete-xdcr[Examples on This Page], use the REST API to delete an XDCR replication as follows.

----
curl -X DELETE -u Administrator:password  \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/controller/cancelXDCR/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4%2Ftravel-sample%2Ftravel-sample
----

Note the encoded form of the endpoint, which is required.
This consists of the `id`, the name of the source bucket, and the name of the target bucket.
These were obtained in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[Pause an XDCR Replication with the REST API].

If the call is successful, no output is displayed.
The replication has been deleted.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-delete-replication.adoc[Deleting a Replication].

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-delete-replication]
== Next Steps

Once a replication has been deleted, you may also wish to delete the _reference_ on which it was based.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-reference.adoc[Delete a Reference].
