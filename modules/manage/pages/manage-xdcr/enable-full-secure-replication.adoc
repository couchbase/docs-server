[#understanding-fully-secure-replications]
== Understanding Fully Secure Replications

A _fully_ secure replication handles both authentication and data-transfer via TLS.
This can be accomplished in either of the following ways:

* Specifying username, password, and root certificate.
* Specifying root and client certificates, and client private key.

For an overview of certificates, see xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].
For specific details on how to prepare and handle certificates for servers and clients, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].

Note that if the client certificate has been generated using the root certificate, the client certificate itself must be specified.
Alternatively, if the client certificate has been generated using intermediate certificates, the entire certificate chain — including the client certificate and all intermediate certificates — must be specified.

[#examples-on-this-page-fully-secure-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to secure a replication _fully_; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a Replication].

[#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-ui]
== Enable Fully Secure Replications with the UI

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*XDCR Replications* screen.
The upper part of the main panel, entitled *Remote Clusters*, lists the currently defined reference.

. Left-click on the *Edit* button, located at the right-hand side of the row:

+
[#references-edit-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-edit-button.png[,220,align=middle]

+
This brings up the partially filled *Edit Remote Cluster* dialog:

+
[#edit-remote-cluster-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog.png[,400,align=middle]

. In the dialog, enter the *Password* for the remote cluster, and check the *Enable Secure Connection* checkbox.
The dialog now expands vertically:

+
[#edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded.png[,400,align=middle]
+
The *Half* radio button is checked by default: this means that half-secure replication is selected.
Instead, select the *Full (TLS encrypt password and data)* button.
The dialog again expands vertically, and now appears as follows:
+
[#xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-full-expanded-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-full-expanded-initial.png[,400,align=middle]

+
Proceed in either of the ways explained immediately below.

[#specify-full-xdcr-security-with-credentials]
=== Specify Username, Password, and Root Certificate

This procedure requires access to the root certificate for the destination cluster.
This can be obtained by accessing the destination cluster by means of Couchbase Web Console; and accessing the *Root Certificate* panel, from the *Security* screen.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-security-settings.adoc#root-certificate-security-screen-display[Root Certificate].

A procedure for substituting a different root certificate for the provided default is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].

. In the open *Add* or *Edit* dialog, enter the *Username for Remote Cluster*, and *Password*.

. Copy and paste the root certificate for the remote cluster into the top interactive pane, below the radio buttons — leaving both of the lower interactive panes blank.
+
The dialog now appears approximately as follows:
+
[#xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded-with-creds]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded-with-creds.png[,400]

. Left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower-right of the dialog.

All replications to the edited reference now proceed securely.

[#specify-full-xdcr-security-with-certificates]
=== Specify Root and Client Certificates, and Client Private Key

This procedure requires access to the root certificate for the destination cluster.
This can be obtained by accessing the destination cluster by means of Couchbase Web Console; and accessing the *Root Certificate* panel, from the *Security* screen.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-security-settings.adoc#root-certificate-security-screen-display[Root Certificate].

A procedure for substituting a different root certificate for the provided default is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates].
This also demonstrates how the contents of certificates and keys can be displayed on the command line, and so made available for copying and pasting.

Information on creating a corresponding _client certificate_ and _client private key_ is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc[Configure Client Certificates].

Proceed as follows.
(Note that specific file-examples to be used are listed in xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc#using-client-and-server-certificates-for-secure-xdcr[Using Client and Server Certificates for Secure XDCR].)

. Copy and paste the root certificate for the destination cluster into the top interactive pane.

. Check the *Use Client Certificate Authentication* checkbox.
The dialog expands vertically, as follows:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-expanded-client-certificate-authentication-dialog.png[,400]
+
Interactive fields have thus become visible, for the specifying of *Client Certificate* and *Client Key*.

. Copy and paste the client certificate prepared for the source cluster into the middle interactive pane.

. Copy and paste the client private key prepared for the source cluster into the bottom interactive pane.

. Ensure that the *Username for Remote Cluster* and *Password* fields are blank.
The dialog now appears approximately as follows:
+
[#xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded-with-certs]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded-with-certs.png[,400]

. Left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower-right of the dialog.

If errors have occurred in certificate-preparation, these are displayed at the top of the dialog.
Otherwise, all replications for the edited reference are now fully secured.

See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates] and xref:manage:manage-security/configure-client-certificates.adoc[Configure Client Certificates] for information on certificate-preparation.

[#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-add-remote-cluster]
=== Enable Fully Secure Replications with Add Remote Cluster

Left-clicking on the *Add Remote Cluster* button, located at the upper-right of the *XDCR Replications* screen, brings up the *Add Remote Cluster* dialog.
As shown in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui[Create an XDCR Reference with the UI], this is used to create a new reference.
The field-content of this dialog is identical to that of the *Edit Remote Cluster* dialog, just examined: therefore it too can be used to establish security for the reference and its corresponding replications.

[#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-cli]
== Enable Fully Secure Replications with the CLI

To create and edit a reference, and attribute to it a security-level, use the `xdcr-setup` command.
Use of this command to create a non-secure reference is already demonstrated in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli[Create an XDCR Reference with the CLI].

From the starting-point given above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-full-secure-replication[Examples on this Page], proceed as follows.

[#edit-existing-reference-to-fully-secure-with-creds-cli]

The new reference is now fully secured, as will be its associated replications.

[#create-new-fully-secure-reference-with-certs-cli]
=== Create a New, Fully Secure Reference with CLI, Using Certificates

To create a new, fully secure reference from `10.142.180.101` to `10.142.180.103` by means of the remote cluster's root certificate, a client certificate, and a client private key, enter the following:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator -p password \

For more information, see the complete reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-setup.adoc[xdcr-setup].

[#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-rest-api]
== Enable Fully Secure Replications with the REST API

To create or edit a reference, and attribute _full_ security to it, use the `/pools/default/remoteClusters` URI.
Reference-creation with this URI is already demonstrated in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api[Create an XDCR Reference with the REST API]: note that this example used the `demandEncryption` flag with a value of zero, to specify non-secure replications.

From the starting-point given above in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-half-secure-replication[Examples on this Page], proceed as described in the subsections below.

[#make-existing-reference-fully-secure-with-creds-rest]
=== Secure an Existing Reference with REST, Using Credentials

To edit the existing reference from `10.142.180.101` to `10.142.180.102`, fully securing it by means of the remote cluster's appropriate administrative credentials and its root certificate, enter the following:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102 \
-d name=10.142.180.102 \
-d hostname=10.142.180.102:8091 \
-d "username=Administrator" \
-d "password=password" \
-d "demandEncryption=true" \
-d secureType=full \
--data-urlencode "certificate=$(cat /Users/username/cert/ca.pem)"
----

The URI terminates with the name of the remote cluster, signifying that this operation _edits_, rather than _creates_.
The `username` and `password` specified are those of the remote cluster.
Note that the `demandEncryption` flag is set to `true`, and the `encryptionType` flag specifies `full`.
The required `--dataurlencode` flag specifies the local path to the root certificate for the remote cluster.

Formatted, the output from a successful execution is as follows:

----
{
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDAjCCAeqgAwIB...
  ...e5yV\nkOYCnuwY\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "deleted": false,
