= Enable Half-Secure Replications

[abstract]
_Half-Secure_ replication secures the specified password only: it does not secure data.

[#understanding-half-secure-replications]
== Understanding Half-Secure Replications

A _Half_ secure replication secures the specified password only: it does not secure data.
The password is secured:

* By hashing with SCRAM-SHA, when the destination cluster is running Couchbase Enterprise Server 5.5 or later.
* By TLS encryption, when the destination cluster is running a pre-5.5 Couchbase Enterprise Server.

The root certificate of the destination cluster must be provided, for a successful TLS connection to be achieved.
If this certificate is provided and a SCRAM-SHA connection is achieved, the certificate is ignored.
The root certificate can be obtained by accessing the *Root Certificate* tab, on the *Security* screen for the remote cluster: copy the certificate from the interactive panel in which it appears.

Note that replication-security is established _per reference_: this means that the security level assigned to the reference (which specifies a remote cluster) is automatically assigned to all replications based on that reference.

To enable a secure _half_ connection with a destination cluster that may be either pre-5.5 or 5.5 and beyond, proceed as described below.

[#examples-on-this-page-half-secure-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to _half-secure_ a replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-ui[UI], the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a Replication].

[#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-ui]
== Enable Half-Secure Replications with the UI

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This brings up the [.ui]*XDCR Replications* screen.
The upper part of the main panel, entitled *Remote Clusters*, lists the currently defined reference.

. Left-click on the *Edit* button, located at the right-hand side of the row for the reference:

+
[#references-edit-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-edit-button.png[,220,align=middle]

+
This brings up the partially filled *Edit Remote Cluster* dialog:

+
[#edit-remote-cluster-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog.png[,400,align=middle]

. In the dialog, enter the *Password* for the remote cluster, and check the *Enable Secure Connection* checkbox.
The dialog now expands vertically:

+
[#edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-expanded.png[,400,align=middle]
+
The *Half* radio button is checked by default: this means that half-secure replication is selected.

. To achieve half-secure connections with pre-5.5 versions of Couchbase Enterprise Server, copy and paste the root certificate for the destination cluster into the interactive panel, below the radio buttons.
(This certificate can be found under the *Root Certificate* tab of the Couchbase Web Console *Security* screen: copy it there, and paste it here.)
+
The dialog now appears approximately as follows:
+
[#xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-complete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-edit-remote-cluster-dialog-complete.png[,400]

. Left-click on the *Save* button, at the lower-right of the dialog.

The concludes UI-based enablement of half-secure replication.
From this point, any existing replication based on the edited reference is continued in half-secure form.
All new replications based on the edited reference will be started in half-secure form.

[#enable-half-secure-replications-with-add-remote-cluster]
=== Enable Half-Secure Replications with Add Remote Cluster

Left-clicking on the *ADD REMOTE* button, located at the upper-right of the *XDCR Replications* screen, brings up the *Add Remote Cluster* dialog.
As shown in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui[Create an XDCR Reference with the UI], this is used to create a new reference.
The field-content of this dialog is identical to that of the *Edit Remote Cluster* dialog, just examined: therefore it too can be used to establish security for the reference and its corresponding replications.

[#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-cli]
== Enable Half-Secure Replications with the CLI

To create and edit a reference, and attribute to it a security-level, use the `xdcr-setup` command.
Use of this command to create a non-secure reference is already demonstrated in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli[Create an XDCR Reference with the CLI].

From the starting-point given above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-half-secure-replication[Examples on this Page], to create a new reference, to a cluster named `10.142.180.103`, specifying half-secure replications, enter the following:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--create \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.103 \
--xdcr-hostname 10.142.180.103 \
--xdcr-username Administrator \
--xdcr-password password \
--xdcr-secure-connection half \
--xdcr-certificate /Users/tonyhillman/cert/remote-ca.pem
----

The `--create` flag specifies that the command is being used to create a new reference.
The `--xdcr-username` and `--xdcr-password` are those of the remote cluster.
The `--xdcr-certificate` is the root certificate of the remote cluster, specified as a local pathname.

If successful, the call returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: Cluster reference created
----

The new reference is _half_ secure, as will be all replications based on it.

To _edit_ the existing reference `10.142.180.101:8091`, and thereby change it from its original non-secure state to one that is half-secure, enter the following:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--edit \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.102 \
--xdcr-hostname 10.142.180.102 \
--xdcr-username Administrator \
--xdcr-password password \
--xdcr-secure-connection half \
--xdcr-certificate /Users/username/cert/remote-ca.pem
----

The `--edit` flag specifies that the command is being used to edit an existing reference.

If the command is successful, the following is displayed:

----
SUCCESS: Cluster reference edited
----

The edited reference and its assocated replications are now half-secure.

For more information, see the complete reference for xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-setup.adoc[xdcr-setup].

[#enable-half-secure-replications-with-the-rest-api]
== Enable Half-Secure Replications with the REST API

To create or edit a reference, and attribute to it a particular security-level, use the `/pools/default/remoteClusters` URI.
Reference-creation with this URI is already demonstrated in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api[Create an XDCR Reference with the REST API]: note that this example used the `demandEncryption` flag with a value of zero, to specify non-secure replications.

From the starting-point given above in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-half-secure-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-half-secure-replication[Examples on this Page], to create a new reference, to a cluster named `10.142.180.103`, specifying half-secure replications, enter the following:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters \
-d "name=10.142.180.103" \
-d "hostname=10.142.180.103:8091" \
-d "username=Administrator" \
-d "password=password" \
-d "demandEncryption=true" \
-d "encryptionType=half" \
--data-urlencode "certificate=$(cat /Users/myself/cert/root/ca.pem)"
----

The `username` and `password` specified are those of the remote cluster.
Note that the `demandEncryption` flag is set to `true`, and the `encryptionType` flag specifies `half`.
The optional `--dataurlencode` flag specifies the local path to the root certificate for the remote cluster: this creates half-secure connections to remote clusters running pre-5.5 versions of Couchbase Enterprise Server.

Output from a successful call, when formatted, is as follows:

----
{
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDlzCCAn6ECu1yLb......
  ....Lx/0WA\nDwNqXw/Cd6CIcnc=\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "deleted": false,
  "demandEncryption": true,
  "encryptionType": "half",
  "hostname": "10.142.180.102:8091",
  "name": "10.142.180.102",
  "secureType": "half",
  "uri": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102",
  "username": "Administrator",
  "uuid": "fe8df4ff66e7e8121c249de13fb3324a",
  "validateURI": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102?just_validate=1"
}
----

The `secureType` field indicates that the new reference is `half` secure.

To _edit_ the existing reference `10.142.180.101:8091`, and thereby change it from its original non-secure state to one that is half-secure, supporting only clusters that are at least version 5.5, enter the following:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102 \
-d "name=10.142.180.102" \
-d "hostname=10.142.180.102:8091" \
-d "username=Administrator" \
-d "password=password" \
-d "demandEncryption=true" \
-d "encryptionType=half"
----

Note that the URI is here extended, to include the name of the remote cluster.
(If this is not included, the command is interpreted as intended to _create_ rather than to _edit_, and fails with a `Duplicate cluster names are not allowed` message.)
The `demandEncryption` flag is specified as `true`, and the `encryptionType` is `half`.

Output from a successful call, when formatted, appears as follows:

----
{
  "deleted": false,
  "demandEncryption": true,
  "encryptionType": "half",
  "hostname": "10.142.180.102:8091",
  "name": "10.142.180.102",
  "secureType": "half",
  "uri": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102",
  "username": "Administrator",
  "uuid": "fe8df4ff66e7e8121c249de13fb3324a",
  "validateURI": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102?just_validate=1"
}
----

The `secureType` field indicates that the edited reference is now `half` secure.

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-half-secure-replication]
== Next Steps

Replication can be _fully_ secured; meaning that both the password and the data are encrypted with TLS.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc[Enable Fully Secure Replications].
