= Prepare for XDCR
:page-aliases: xdcr:xdcr-create

[abstract]
Before setting up a replication, make sure you have the appropriate
administrative roles. The, make sure your cluster is appropriately
configured and provisioned.

[#establish-roles-for-xdcr]
== Establish Roles for XDCR

Couchbase Server enforces _Role-Based Access Control_. This means that
to access specific system-resources, corresponding _privileges_ are
required. Privileges have a fixed association with _roles_, which are
assigned to _users_.

Full information on Role-Based Access Control is
provided in
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
If you possess the role of _Full_, _Cluster_, or _XDCR Administrator_, you
can create, edit, and delete cluster references and replications.


[#prepare-your-cluster-for-XDCR]
== Prepare Your Cluster for XDCR

Before beginning XDCR management:

* Configure all nodes within the source cluster so that they can
individually communicate
over the network to all nodes within the target cluster.

* Ensure that all Couchbase Server platforms match.
For instance, if you want to replicate from a Linux-based cluster, you need to
do so with another Linux-based cluster.

* Confirm that your cluster is properly sized, and is able to handle new XDCR
streams.
For example, XDCR needs 1-2 additional CPU cores per stream; and in some
cases, will require additional RAM and network resources as well.
If a cluster is not sized to handle _both_ the existing workload _and_ the
new XDCR streams, the performance of both XDCR and the cluster overall may
be negatively impacted.

* Couchbase Server uses TCP/IP port `8091` to exchange cluster configuration
information.
If you are communicating with a destination cluster over a dedicated connection,
or over the Internet, ensure that all nodes in the destination and source
clusters can communicate with each other over ports `8091` and `8092`.
