[#examples-on-this-page-resume-xdcr]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to resume a replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a Replication].

[#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Resume an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=middle]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel features an *Outgoing Replications* panel that currently has the following appearance:
+
[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-panel-replication-paused]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-panel-replication-paused.png[,800,align=left]
+
This features information on a single, currently defined replication.
In the `status` column, this replication is shown to be `paused`, and a *Run* button is displayed.

. To resume the replication, left-click on the *Run* button:
+
[#xdcr-left-click-on-resume-replication-button-before]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-left-click-on-resume-replication-button-before.png[,110,align=left]
+
The word `paused` changes to `replicating`, and the *Run* button is again displayed as a *Pause* button.
+
[#xdcr-resume-replication-button-after]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-resume-replication-button-after.png[,110,align=left]

Replication has now been resumed.

[#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Resume an XDCR Replication with the CLI

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-resume-xdcr[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command with the `--resume` flag, to pause an XDCR replication as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--resume \
--xdcr-replicator=570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/travel-sample/travel-sample
----

The value specified for the `--xdcr-replicator` flag is that retrieved by means of the `--list` flag, shown in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[Pause an XDCR Replication with the CLI].

If successful, the command returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication resume
----

Replication has now been resumed.

[#resume-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Resume an XDCR Replication with the REST API

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-resume-xdcr[Examples on This Page], use the REST API to resume an XDCR replication as follows.

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/settings/replications/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4%2Ftravel-sample%2Ftravel-sample \
-d pauseRequested=false
----

The endpoint used here features, in sequence, the `id` of the reference, the name of the source bucket, and the name of the remote bucket.
These were obtained in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api [Pause an XDCR Replication with the REST API].
The value of the `pauseRequested` flag is here set to `false`.

The output is as follows:

----
{
  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "compressionType": "Auto",
  "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
  "failureRestartInterval": 10,
  "filterExpression": "",
  "logLevel": "Info",
  "networkUsageLimit": 0,
  "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
  "pauseRequested": false,
  "sourceNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "statsInterval": 1000,
  "targetNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "type": "xmem",
  "workerBatchSize": 500
}
----

Replication has now been restarted.

== Next Steps

Once a replication is no longer needed, you can _delete_ it.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc[Delete a Replication].
