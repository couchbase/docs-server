[#understanding-filtering]
== Understanding Filtering

XDCR Advanced Filtering allows a limited subset of documents to be replicated from the source bucket.
An _expression_ is created, and used to identify documents that provide a match.
The expression can be applied to:

* The document's key
* Fields and values in the document-body
* The document's extended attributes

This page explains the practical steps whereby filtering can be performed.
Note that when entered by means of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the expression can be a maximum of 250 bytes (characters) in length: this restriction does _not_ apply to expressions entered by means of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI] or the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

For a full conceptual description and links to reference information on regular and filtering expressions, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering].

[#examples-on-this-page-create-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to filter the same replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the following:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node.
These are named after their IP addresses: `10.144.210.101` and `10.144.210.102`.

* Clusters `10.144.210.101` and `10.144.210.102` each contain a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample` bucket.

* On cluster `10.144.210.102`, the bucket `travel-sample` contains an additional, administrator-created collection, within the scope named `inventory`: this collection is named *France_airport*.
(For information on creating scopes and collections, see xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[Manage Scopes and Collections]).

* On cluster `10.144.210.101`, a reference has been defined to `10.144.210.102`, as a remote cluster.

* No replication between the clusters yet exists.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. On `10.144.210.101`, access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=middle]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, whose *Remote Clusters* panel currently shows that a reference to `10.144.210.102` has been defined; and whose *Outgoing Replications* panel shows that no replications have yet been defined.
+
[#filter-xdcr-replications-screen-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replications-screen-initial.png[,700,align=left]

. To define and filter a replication, left-click on the *Add Replication* tab, towards the right:
+
[#left-click-on-add-replication-button]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-add-replication-button.png[,160,align=left]
+
This displays the *XDCR Add Replication* screen:
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-screen.png[,660,align=left]

. Specify _travel-sample_ as both source and target bucket; then specify `10.144.210.1012` as the target cluster.
The fields now appear as follows:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-filter-replication-first-line.png[,660]

. Left-click on the *Filter Replication* toggle.
The panel now expands vertically:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-filter-replication-open-panel.png[,660]
+
To replicate only those documents whose key features the string _airport_, and whose body contains _France_ as the value of _country_, enter the expression _'REGEXP_CONTAINS(country, "France")'_, in the *Filter Expression* field:
+
[#filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-lower-with-expression]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-lower-with-expression.png[,660,align=left]

. Test the expression against a specified document.
+
Note that an expression _must_ be tested successfully, before it can be included as part of the replication: if an expression is specified and attemptedly saved without having been tested, the expression is ignored when saving occurs; and the replication is thus started in unfiltered form.
+
Enter the document's _id_ in the interactive field adjacent to the *Test Filter* button.
Then, left-click on the *Test Filter* button.
If the specified document provides a successful match, this is indicated to the right of the *Test Filter* button:
+
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-test-filter-success.png[,400,align=left]
+
If the test fails, a `no match` notification is provided, in the same location.

. Left-click on the *Specify Scopes, Collections, and Mappings* toggle.
The panel expands vertically:
+
image::manage-xdcr/specify-scopes-panel.png[,820]

. Uncheck all listed scopes except *inventory*.
Left-click on the *inventory* row, to expand the row vertically:
+
image::manage-xdcr/expanded-inventory-row.png[,820]

. Uncheck all collections listed within the *inventory* scope, except *airport*; and modify the destination field for *airport* to read *France_airport*.
The row for *inventory* thus appears as follows:
+
image::manage-xdcr/expanded-inventory-row-complete.png[,820]
+
This indicates that only data from the source collection *airport* will be replicated, and will be replicated to the *France_airport* collection on the target.
The filter previously specified in the *Filter Expression* panel will be applied, and only documents that provide a match to the filter will be replicated.

. Left-click on the *Save Replication* button, at the bottom of the screen:
+
image::manage-xdcr/save-replication-button.png[,220]
+
This saves the replication, and redisplays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
This now indicates that the saved replication is running:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-replications-screen-with-filtered-replication.png[,820]
+
To check the filter that has been applied, left-click on the the `filter` tab:
+
[#filter-xdcr-check-filter]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-check-filter.png[,220,align=left]
+
Note that if a filter has been specified, but has not been successfully tested, and therefore has not been included in the replication, the `filter` tab does not appear on the row for the replication.

. To examine the content of collection _inventory.France_airport_, within `travel-sample` on cluster `10.144.210.102`, access the cluster by means of Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the *Buckets* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar.
Then, examine the collections within the *inventory* scope.
Left-click on the *Documents* tab for the collection *France_airport*:
+
[#filter-xdcr-remote-cluster-buckets-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/documents-tab-for-france-airport.png[,820,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Documents* screen for the collection.
The contents affirm that replication has occurred successfully:
+
image::manage-xdcr/documents-for-france-airport.png[,820]

For lists of available regular and filtering expressions, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Reference].

=== Applying Multiple Filters

Only one filter can be applied to a single replication: thus, once defined, the filter is applied to _all_ mappings.
Note also that only _one_ replication can be established between a given source bucket and a given target bucket.
Therefore, to apply multiple filters, the corresponding number of replications must be established between different bucket-combinations.

[#deletion-filters]
=== Deletion Filters

The *Filter Replication* panel features optional _deletion filters_:

image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-deletion-filters.png[,320,align=left]

These filters control whether the deletion of a document at source causes deletion of a replica that has been created.
Each filter covers a specific deletion-context:

* *Do not replicate document expirations*.
If checked, this means that if, having been replicated, the document at source _expires_ and is deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, expirations at source _are_ replicated; meaning that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

* *Do not replicate DELETE operations*.
If checked, this means that if, having been replicated, the document at source is expressly deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, deletions at source _are_ replicated; meaning that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

* *Remove TTL from replicated items*.
If checked, this means that the TTL that a document bears at source is _not_ made part of the replicated copy of the document.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, the TTL _is_ made part of the replicated copy of the document, and thereby determines when the replicated copy of the document expires.

For information on TTL and expiration, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

[#editing-filters]
=== Editing

Once established, an XDCR filter &#8212; along with *Replication Priority* and *Advanced Replication Settings* &#8212; can be edited.

In the *Outgoing Replications* panel, left-click on the row for the replication.
When the *Edit* button is displayed, left-click on it.
This brings up the *XDCR Edit Replication* screen: it content is nearly identical to that of the *XDCR Add Replications* screen, and thereby allows the filter to be modified and saved.
Note that the radio-button options *Save filter & restart replication*, and *Save & continue replicating* are provided:

image::manage-xdcr/save-filter-options.png[,820]

For a complete description of these options, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc#filter-expression-editing[Filter-Expression Editing].

Left-click on the *Save Replication* button, to save edits.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the CLI

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command can be used to create a filtered XDCR replication.

The example assumes that the `travel-sample` bucket is resident on each of two, single-node clusters, which are each named after their IP address.
The bucket on the target has an additional collection within the `inventory` scope, which is named `France_airport`.

The replication is configured to replicate only to the collection `France_airport`; and to replicate from the source-collection `airport` only those documents whose `country` value is `France`.

This requires use of the following filter-expression:

----
'REGEXP_CONTAINS(country, "France")'
----

This also requires an _explicit mapping_ to be specified, as follows:

----
{
  "tenant_agent_00": null,
  "tenant_agent_01": null,
  "tenant_agent_02": null,
  "tenant_agent_03": null,
  "inventory.landmark": null,
  "inventory.hotel": null,
  "inventory.airline": null,
  "inventory.route": null,
  "inventory.airport": "inventory.France_airport"
}
----

This explicit mapping specifies that replication from all `tenant_agent` scopes on the source is denied.
It also specifies that replication from all source-collections within `inventory` is denied; with the exception of replication from the source-collection `inventory.airport`, which is validated as proceeding to the target-collection `inventory.France_airport`.

The full expression is as follows.
Note that the `collection-explicit-mappings` flag has been set to `1`, as required, in order to enable explicit mappings:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate \
-c localhost:8091 \
-u Administrator -p password \
--create --xdcr-cluster-name 10.144.210.102 \
--xdcr-from-bucket travel-sample \
--xdcr-to-bucket travel-sample \
--filter-expression 'REGEXP_CONTAINS(country, "France")' \
--collection-explicit-mappings 1 \
--collection-mapping-rules '{"tenant_agent_00":null,"tenant_agent_01":null,"tenant_agent_02":null,"tenant_agent_03":null,"inventory.landmark":null,"inventory.hotel":null,"inventory.airline":null,"inventory.route":null,"inventory.airport":"inventory.France_airport"}'
----

If successful, the command returns the following output:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication created
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[xdcr-replicate] command.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the REST API

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], the REST API's `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI can be used to create a filtered XDCR replication.

The assumptions and requirements are identical to those described above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[Filter an XDCR Replication with the CLI].

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d fromBucket=travel-sample \
-d toCluster=10.144.210.102 \
-d toBucket=travel-sample \
-d priority=High \
-d collectionsExplicitMapping=true \
-d filterExpression=%27REGEXP_CONTAINS(country%2C%20%22France%22)%27 \
-d colMappingRules=%7B%22tenant_agent_00%22%3Anull%2C%22tenant_agent_01%22%3Anull%2C%22tenant_agent_02%22%3Anull%2C%22tenant_agent_03%22%3Anull%2C%22inventory.landmark%22%3Anull%2C%22inventory.hotel%22%3Anull%2C%22inventory.airline%22%3Anull%2C%22inventory.route%22%3Anull%2C%22inventory.airport%22%3A%22inventory.France_airport%22%7D
----

Note that the flag `collectionsExplicitMapping` is set to `true`; as is required to enable explicit mapping.
Note also that the filter and mapping-rules expressions are necessarily encoded.

If the call is successful, `200 OK` is returned, with a response such as the following:

----
{"id":"8ac0de0d95d5863d7b41e246755a7ec8/travel-sample/travel-sample"}
----

The response features the `id` of the successfully created replication.
