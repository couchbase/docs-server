[#understanding-filtering]
== Understanding Filtering

XDCR Advanced Filtering allows a limited subset of documents to be replicated from the source bucket.
An _expression_ is created, and used to identify documents that provide a match.
The expression can be applied to:

* The document's key
* Fields and values in the document-body
* The document's extended attributes

This page explains the practical steps whereby filtering can be performed.
Note that when entered by means of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the expression can be a maximum of 250 bytes (characters) in length: this restriction does _not_ apply to expressions entered by means of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI] or the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API].

For a full conceptual description and links to reference information on regular and filtering expressions, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering].

[#examples-on-this-page-create-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to filter the same replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the following:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node.
These are named after their IP addresses: `10.143.192.101` and `10.143.192.102`.

* Cluster `10.143.192.101` contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample` bucket.

* Cluster `10.143.192.102` contains three buckets, named _France_airport_, _US_airline_, and _US_airport_.

* On cluster `10.143.192.101`, a reference has been defined to `10.143.192.102`, as a remote cluster.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. On `10.143.192.101`, access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=middle]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, whose *Remote Clusters* panel currently shows that a reference to `10.143.192.102` has been defined; and whose *Outgoing Replications* panel shows that no replications have yet been defined.
+
[#filter-xdcr-replications-screen-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replications-screen-initial.png[,700,align=left]

. To define and filter a replication, left-click on the *Add Replication* tab, towards the right:
+
[#left-click-on-add-replication-button]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-add-replication-button.png[,160,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Replication* dialog:
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-dialog.png[,400,align=left]

. Specify _travel-sample_ as the source bucket, `10.143.192.10` as the target cluster, and _France_airport_ as the destination bucket.
Then, left-click on *Replication Filters*.
This expands the lower part of the dialog, as follows:
+
[#filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-expanded]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-expanded.png[,400,align=left]
+
To replicate only those documents whose key features the string _airport_, and whose body contains _France_ as the value of _country_, enter the expression _REGEXP_CONTAINS(META().id, "^airport") AND country = "France"_, in the *Filter Expression* field:
+
[#filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-lower-with-expression]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-add-replication-dialog-lower-with-expression.png[,400,align=left]

. Test the expression against a specified document.
+
Note that an expression _must_ be tested successfully, before it can be included as part of the replication: if an expression is specified and attemptedly saved without having been tested, the expression is ignored when saving occurs; and the replication is thus started in unfiltered form.
+
Enter the document's _id_ in the interactive field adjacent to the *Test Filter* button:
+
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-enter-test-airport.png[,400,align=left]
+
Left-click on the *Test Filter* button.
If the specified document provides a successful match, this is indicated to the right of the *Test Filter* button:
+
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-test-filter-success.png[,400,align=left]
+
If the test fails a `no match` notification is provided, in the same location.

. When testing has proved successful, left-click on the *Save* button.
The dialog disappears.
The *Outgoing Replications* panel now appears as follows:
+
[#filter-xdcr-replications-screen-one-replication]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replications-screen-one-replication.png[,700,align=left]
+
This indicates that a replication is now in process from the _travel-sample_ bucket to the remote bucket _France_airport_, on cluster `10.143.192.102`.
To check the filter that has been applied, left-click on the the `filter` tab:
+
[#filter-xdcr-check-filter]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-check-filter.png[,320,align=left]
+
Note that if a filter has been specified, but has not been successfully tested, and therefore has not been included in the replication, the `filter` tab does not appear on the row for the replication.

. To examine the content of bucket _France_airport_, on cluster `10.143.192.102`, access the cluster by means of Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the *Buckets* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar.
The display shows the three buckets previously defined for the cluster:
+
[#filter-xdcr-remote-cluster-buckets-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-remote-cluster-buckets-initial.png[,700,align=left]

. Open the row for _France_airport_, by left-clicking on the row.
Then, left-click on the *Documents* tab, at the upper-right:
+
[#filter-xdcr-documents-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-documents-tab.png[,160,align=left]
+
The display now shows documents currently contained by the bucket.
+
[#filter-xdcr-replicated-documents]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replicated-documents.png[,700,align=left]
+
Each has been replicated from `10.143.192.102`, in accordance with the filtering expression specified.

. Add two more filtered replications.
+
To replicate documents concerning US airlines to _US_airline_, use the expression _REGEXP_CONTAINS(META().id, "^airline") AND country = "United States"_.
+
To replicate documents concerning US airports to _US_airport_, use the expression _REGEXP_CONTAINS(META().id, "^airport") AND country = "United States"_.
+
Once these additional, two replications have been added, the *Outgoing Replications* panel appears as follows:
+
[#filter-xdcr-all-three-replications]
image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-all-three-replications.png[,700,align=left]

Subsequent examination of the buckets on `10.143.192.102` indicates that each bucket is receiving only the documents specified by its corresponding filter.

For lists of available regular and filtering expressions, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Reference].

[#deletion-filters]
=== Deletion Filters

The *Add Replication* panel features optional _deletion filters_:

image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-deletion-filters.png[,320,align=left]

These filters control whether the deletion of a document at source causes deletion of a replica that has been created.
Each filter covers a specific deletion-context:

* *Do not replicate document expirations*.
If checked, this means that if, having been replicated, the document at source _expires_ and is deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, expirations at source _are_ replicated; meaning that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

* *Do not replicate DELETE operations*.
If checked, this means that if, having been replicated, the document at source is expressly deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, deletions at source _are_ replicated; meanining that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

* *Remove TTL from replicated items*.
If checked, this means that the TTL that a document bears at source is _not_ made part of the replicated copy of the document.
Conversely, if this option is not checked, the TTL _is_ made part of the replicated copy of the document, and thereby determines when the replicated copy of the document expires.

For information on TTL and expiration, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

[#editing-filters]
=== Editing

Once established, an XDCR filter &#8212; along with *Replication Priority* and *Advanced Replication Settings* &#8212; can be edited.

In the *Outgoing Replications* panel, left-click on the row for the replication.
When the *Edit* button is displayed, left-click on it.
This brings up the *Edit Replication* dialog:

image::manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-edit-replication-dialog.png[,400,align=left]

Make changes to the filter as required.
Then, select one of the radio-button options, which are *Save filter & restart replication*, and *Save & continue replicating*.
For a complete description of these options, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc#filter-expression-editing[Filter-Expression Editing].
Finally, left-click on the *Save* button.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the CLI

Staring from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command to create a filtered XDCR replication, as follows:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c localhost:8091 \
-u Administrator -p password --create --xdcr-cluster-name 10.143.192.102 \
--xdcr-from-bucket travel-sample --xdcr-to-bucket US_airport \
--filter-expression 'REGEXP_CONTAINS(META().id, "^airport") AND country = "United States"'
----

This expression specifies that all documents filtered by means of the specified `filter-expression` will be replicated from `travel-sample`, on the localhost `10.143.192.101`, to `US_airport` on the remote cluster `10.143.192.102`.

If successful, the command returns the following output:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication created
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[xdcr-replicate] command.

[#filter-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Filter an XDCR Replication with the REST API

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], using the REST API's `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI, create a filtered XDCR reference as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d toBucket=US_airport \
-d toCluster=10.143.192.102 \
-d fromBucket=travel-sample \
-d filterExpression=REGEXP_CONTAINS%28META%28%29.id%2C+%22%5Eairport%22%29+AND+country+%3D+%22United+States%22
----

This expression specifies that all documents filtered by means of the specified `filter-expression` will be replicated from `travel-sample`, on the localhost `10.143.192.101`, to `US_airport` on the remote cluster `10.143.192.102`.

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[Creating XDCR Replications].

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-filter-replication]
== Next Steps

Data, lost from a local cluster due to catastrophic outage, can be recovered from a remote cluster to which an XDCR replication was occurring.
