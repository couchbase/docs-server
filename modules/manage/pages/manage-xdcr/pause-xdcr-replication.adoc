[#examples-on-this-page-pause-xdcr]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to pause the same replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc[Create a Replication].

[#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Pause an XDCR Replication with the UI

*Step 1*: Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the right-hand navigation menu.

[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=middle]

This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel, entitled *Outgoing Replications*, currently has the following appearance:

[#ongoing-replications-with-replication]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication.png[,800,align=left]

This shows the single replication that is in progress.
Note that the *status* column displays a status of `Replicating`.

*Step 2*: To pause replication, left-click on the row for the replication.
The row is redisplayed, as follows:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-buttons.png[,800,align=left]

Three interactive buttons are now displayed.
These respectively allow you to *Delete*, *Edit*, or *Pause* the replication.
To pause, left-click on the *Pause* button:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-pause-replication-button.png[,110,align=left]

Initially, a notification declares that the replication is in the process of being paused:

image:manage-xdcr/xdcr-pausing-notification.png[,120,align=left]

Subsequently, the notification changes to indicate that the replication has been paused:

image:manage-xdcr/xdcr-paused-notification.png[,120,align=left]

The *Pause* button has duly become a *Run* button.

[#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Pause an XDCR Replication with the CLI

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-pause-xdcr[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command to pause an XDCR replication as follows.

First, determine the `stream-id` of the replication that you wish to pause.
Use `xdcr-replicate` with the `--list` option, in order to list all ongoing replications from the source cluster:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 -u Administrator -p password \
--list
----

This produces the following output:

----
stream id: 570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/travel-sample/travel-sample
   status: paused
   source: travel-sample
   target: /remoteClusters/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/buckets/travel-sample
----

The `stream-id` consists of three components, which are, in sequence:

* `570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4`: The `uuid` of the reference.
* `travel-sample`: The name of the source bucket.
* `travel-sample`: The name of the target bucket.

With this information, to pause the replication, use the `xdcr-replicate` command with the `--pause` and `--xdcr-replicator` options, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--pause \
--xdcr-replicator=570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/travel-sample/travel-sample
----

If successful, this returns the following:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication paused
----

The replication is now paused.


[#pause-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Pause an XDCR Replication with the REST API

From the starting-point defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-pause-xdcr[Examples on This Page], use the REST API to pause an XDCR replication as follows.

First, determine the `id` of the replication that you wish to pause.
Use the `/pools/default/tasks` endpoint, to produce a list of tasks for the source cluster:

----
curl -i -X GET -u Administrator:password http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/tasks
----

Formatted, the output is as follows:

----
[
  {
    "type": "rebalance",
    "status": "notRunning",
    "statusIsStale": false,
    "masterRequestTimedOut": false
  },
  {
    "cancelURI": "/controller/cancelXDCR/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4%2Ftravel-sample%2Ftravel-sample",
    "settingsURI": "/settings/replications/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4%2Ftravel-sample%2Ftravel-sample",
    "status": "running",
    "replicationType": "xmem",
    "continuous": true,
    "filterExpression": "",
    "id": "570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/travel-sample/travel-sample",
    "pauseRequested": false,
    "source": "travel-sample",
    "target": "/remoteClusters/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4/buckets/travel-sample",
    "type": "xdcr",
    "recommendedRefreshPeriod": 10,
    "changesLeft": 0,
    "docsChecked": 3111,
    "docsWritten": 0,
    "maxVBReps": null,
    "errors": []
  }
]
----

The value associated with the `id` key is the `stream-id` for the replication: featuring, in sequence, the `id` (`570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4`) of the reference, the name of the source bucket (`travel-sample`), and the name of the target bucket (`travel-sample`).

Secondly, use the `settings/replications` URI with the `pauseRequested` flag set to `true`, to pause the replication:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
> http://10.142.180.101:8091/settings/replications/570d0ca2db3b1e128e2fafd362a1bfd4%2Ftravel-sample%2Ftravel-sample \
>  -d pauseRequested=true
----

Note the encoded form of the endpoint, which is required.
Formatted, the output is as follows:

----
{
  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "compressionType": "Auto",
  "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
  "failureRestartInterval": 10,
  "filterExpression": "",
  "logLevel": "Info",
  "networkUsageLimit": 0,
  "optimisticReplicationThreshold": 256,
  "pauseRequested": true,
  "sourceNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "statsInterval": 1000,
  "targetNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "type": "xmem",
  "workerBatchSize": 500
}
----

The replication is now paused.

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-pause-replication]
== Next Steps

Once a replication has been paused, you can opt to _resume_ it.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a Replication].
