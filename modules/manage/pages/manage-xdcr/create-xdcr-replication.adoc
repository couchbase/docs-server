= Create a Replication

[abstract]
An XDCR replication allows data to be replicated continuously from a specified bucket on the source cluster to a specified bucket on the target.


[#understanding-replications]
== Understanding Replications

An XDCR replication is created on the cluster that is to be the source of the data-replication.
Each replication uses a single _reference_, which has already been created.
(See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a Reference].)
To create the replication, you specify:

* The local, source bucket from which data is to be replicated; and, potentially, the scopes and collections within that bucket.

* The remote cluster to which data is to be replicated.
This cluster must already be registered on the local cluster as a _reference_.

* The bucket on the remote cluster to which data is to be replicated; and, potentially, the scopes and collections within that bucket.

* Whether _filtering_ should be used in replication, and if so, according to what regular expression.

* Other _Advanced Replication Settings_, which can be used to optimize replication-performance.

Note that multiple _replications_ (each using a different source-target bucket combination) can be created using a single _reference_ (which refers to a target cluster, but not to any specific bucket on it).

[#examples-on-this-page-create-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create the same replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a Reference], this being:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node.
These are named after their IP addresses: `10.144.210.101` and `10.144.210.102`.

* Each cluster contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample` bucket.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Cluster `10.144.210.101` now has a reference that specifies its own `travel-sample` bucket as a source, and the `travel-sample` bucket on `10.144.210.102` as a target.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the left-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=left]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, the lower part of the main panel of which is entitled *Outgoing Replications*:
+
[#xdcr-screen-ongoing-replications-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-initial.png[,800,align=left]
+
The list, which is designed to show the name and IP address or hostname of each existing replication, is currently empty, and so bears the notification `There are currently no replications defined. Use ADD REPLICATION to set one up`.

. To start creating a replication, left-click on the
*ADD REPLICATION* button:
+
[#left-click-on-add-replication-button]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-add-replication-button.png[,110,align=left]
+
The *XDCR Add Replication* screen is now displayed:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-screen.png[,720,align=left]
+
The fields in the upper area of the screen &#8212; *Replicate From Bucket*, *Remote Bucketr*, and *Remote Cluster* &#8212; allow a replication to be defined that specifies source and target bucket only.
The remaining fields allow _scopes_ and _collections_ &#8212; within source and/or target buckets &#8212; to be additionally specified; and allow *Advanced Settings* to be used.
+
The example on this page will not configure *Advanced Settings*; and will specify source and target bucket only &#8212; each bucket being specified as the sample bucket `travel-sample`.
+
Note that since the data within `travel-sample` is contained within multiple _scopes_ and _collections_, the path to each collection  &#8212; known as a _keyspace_, and always being of the form `scope-name.collection-name` &#8212; is necessarily identical on each cluster.
XDCR's default behavior is always to replicate data between corresponding keyspaces: for example, data in `inventory.airline` on the source is replicated to `inventory.airline` on the target.
When a keyspace on the source does *not* have a corresponding keyspace on the target, XDCR's default behavior is *not* to replicate data from that source keyspace.
This is known as replication by _implicit mapping_.
+
Detailed examples of _explicitly_ specifying scopes and collections (and so, potentially, establishing mappings between dissimilar keyspaces) are provided later, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/replicate-using-scopes-and-collections.adoc[Replicate Using Scopes and Collections].
+
An account of *Advanced Settings* is provided in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced Replication Settings with the UI], below.
+
The practical steps required for establishing filters are explained in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc[Filter a Replication].

. Enter appropriate information into the upper fields of the *Add Replication* screen.
Specify `10.144.210.102` as the target cluster, and `travel-sample` as both source and target bucket.
The fields in the upper area of the screen now appear as follows.
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-screen-upper-fields-complete.png[,400,align=left]
+
[#ongoing-replications-with-replication]
. Left-click on the *Save Replication* button, at the bottom of the screen:
+
image::manage-xdcr/saveReplicationButton.png[,140,align=Left]
+
The *XDCR Replications* screen is now redisplayed, with the appearance of the *Outgoing Replications* panel as follows:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication2.png[,800,align=left]
+
This indicates that a replication is now in progress: from `travel-sample` on this cluster, to `travel-sample` on cluster `10.144.210.102`.

This concludes creation of the replication.
Note that by left-clicking on the row for the replication, additional controls can be displayed:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication-opened.png[,800,align=left]

Use of the *Pause* control is described in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a Replication]; use of the *Delete* control in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc[Delete a Replication]; and use of the *Edit* control in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#editing-filters[Editing Filters].

To see real-time statistics on the current replication, left-click on the *XDCR Stats* tab, at the left:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-statistics.png[,600,align=left]

For information on how to read the interactive charts now displayed, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer]
=== Advanced Replication Settings with the UI

Left-click on the *Advanced Replication Settings* control, in the *Add Replication* dialog.
The UI expands vertically, to reveal the following:

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-menu]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-advanced-settings.png[,400,align=left]

The values displayed in the fields are defaults, which can be modified interactively, and saved: this may help in achieving optimal replication-performance.
For details on the significance of each field, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Reference].

[#error-notifications]
=== Error Notifications

If, while a replication is in progress, errors occur, a notification appears adjacent to the status displayed on the row for the replication:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-error-notification.png[,120,align=left]

Left-click on the orange icon, to display a full account of problems:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-error-notification-full.png[,400,align=left]

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the CLI

Staring from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command to create an XDCR replication, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.144.210.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--create \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.144.210.102 \
--xdcr-from-bucket travel-sample \
--xdcr-to-bucket travel-sample \
--xdcr-replication-mode xmem
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication created
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[xdcr-replicate] command.
Note that this includes descriptions of all flags that support the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced Settings], described above.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the REST API

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], using the REST API's `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI, create an XDCR reference as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d fromBucket=travel-sample \
-d toCluster=10.144.210.102 \
-d toBucket=travel-sample \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d enableCompression=1
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
{"id":"82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1/travel-sample/travel-sample"}
----

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[Creating XDCR Replications].
For information on REST-driven configuration of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced Settings] described above, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-adv-settings.adoc[Managing Advanced XDCR Settings].

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-create-replication]
== Next Steps

Once a replication has been defined and is therefore running, you can opt to _pause_ it, in order to perform system maintenance.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a Replication].
