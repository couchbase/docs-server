= Create a Replication

[abstract]
An XDCR replication allows
data to be replicated continuously from a specified bucket on the source
cluster to a specified bucket on the target.


[#understanding-replications]
== Understanding Replications

An XDCR replication is created on the cluster that is to be the source of
the data-replication. Each replication uses a single _reference_, which has
already been created. (See
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a
Reference].) To create the replication, you specify:

* The local, source bucket from which data is to be replicated.

* The remote cluster to which data is to be replicated. This cluster must
already be registered on the local cluster as a _reference_.

* The bucket on the remote cluster to which data is to be replicated.

* The XDCR protocol to be used.

* Whether _filtering_ should be used in replication, and if so, according to
what regular expression.

* Other _Advanced Settings_, which can be used to optimize
replication-performance.

Note that multiple _replications_ (each using a different source-target
bucket combination) can be created using a single _reference_ (which
refers to a target cluster, but not to any specific bucket on it).

[#examples-on-this-page-create-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create the same
replication; using the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI],
the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST
API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a
Reference], this being:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node. These are
named after their IP addresses: `10.142.180.101` and `10.142.180.102`.

* Each cluster contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample`
bucket.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of
`Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Cluster `10.142.180.101` now has a reference that specifies its own
`travel-sample` bucket as a source, and the `travel-sample` bucket on
`10.142.180.102` as a target.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the
right-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,100,align=left]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, the lower part of the main panel
of which is entitled *Ongoing Replications*:
+
[#xdcr-screen-ongoing-replications-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-ongoing-replications-initial.png[,800,align=left]
+
The list,
which is designed to show the name and IP address or hostname of each
existing replication, is currently empty, and so bears the
notification `There are no replications currently in progress`.

. To start creating a replication, left-click on the
*Add Replication* button:
+
[#left-click-on-add-replication-button]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-add-replication-button.png[,200,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Replication* dialog:
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-dialog.png[,400,align=left]

. Enter appropriate information into the fields of the *Add
Replication* dialog. Specify `10.142.180.102` as the target cluster, and
`travel-sample` as both source and target bucket. Leave the *XDCR Protocol* as
`Version 2`. At this stage, do not check the `Enable advanced filtering` checkbox,
and do not elect to *Show Advanced Settings*.
+
The completed dialog now appears as follows.
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog-complete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-dialog-complete.png[,400,align=left]
+
Left-click on the *Save* button. The *XDCR Replications* screen is now
redisplayed, with the appearance of the *Ongoing Replications* panel as
follows:
+
[#ongoing-replications-with-replication]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-ongoing-replications-with-replication.png[,800,align=left]
+
This indicates that a replication is now in progress: from `travel-sample` on
`this cluster` to `bucket "travel-sample" on cluster "10.142.180.102"`.

This concludes creation of the replication.

[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-pointer]
=== Advanced Filtering with the UI

*Advanced Filtering* can be enabled by checking the `Enabled advanced
filtering` checkbox. The UI expands to reveal the following field:...

[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-filter-test-initial.png[,400,align=left]

One or more regular expressions, to be used as filters, can be entered into
the *Filter Expression* field. The expression is matched against document
keys within the source bucket. (Note that no match is attempted with
document values.) If a match is successful, that document is replicated.
Documents whose keys do not provide a match are not replicated.

Optionally, document keys can be entered into a *Test Key* field: hitting
return produces successive fields, so any number of keys can be tested. If
a match is successful, the orange *No Match* button is displayed in green,
and signifies that a *Match* has been made:

[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-complete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-filter-test-complete.png[,400,align=left]

Complete information on XDCR filtering is provided in
xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc[XDCR
Filtering].

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer]
=== Advanced Settings with the UI

*Advanced Settings* can be established by left-clicking on the *Show
Advanced Settings* control, on the *Add Replication* dialog. The UI
expands vertically, to reveal the following:

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-menu]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-advanced-settings.png[,400,align=left]

The values displayed in the fields are defaults, which can be modified
interactively, and saved: this may help in achieving optimal
replication-performance. For details on the significance of each field,
See
xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc[XDCR
Advanced Settings].

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the CLI

Staring from the scenario defined above, in
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page],
use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command to create an XDCR replication, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 \
> -u Administrator \
> -p password \
> --create \
> --xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.102 \
> --xdcr-from-bucket travel-sample \
> --xdcr-to-bucket travel-sample \
> --xdcr-replication-mode xmem
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication created
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[xdcr-replicate] command.
Note that this includes descriptions of all flags that support the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced
Settings], described above.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the REST API

Staring from the scenario defined above, in
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page],
using the REST API's
`POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI, create an XDCR
reference as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
> http://10.142.180.101:8091/controller/createReplication \
> -d fromBucket=travel-sample \
> -d toCluster=10.142.180.102 \
> -d toBucket=travel-sample \
> -d replicationType=continuous \
> -d enableCompression=1
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
{"id":"82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1/travel-sample/travel-sample"}
----

For more information, see
xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[Creating XDCR Replications].
For information on REST-driven configuration of the
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced
Settings] described above, see
xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-adv-settings.adoc[Managing Advanced XDCR Settings].

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-create-replication]
== Next Steps

Once a replication has been defined and is therefore running, you can opt
to _pause_ it, in order to perform system maintenance. See
xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a
Replication].
