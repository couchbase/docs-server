= Create a Replication
:description: An XDCR replication allows data to be replicated continuously from a specified bucket on the source cluster to a specified bucket on the target.

[abstract]

[#understanding-replications]
== Understanding Replications

An XDCR replication is created on the cluster that is to be the source of the data-replication.
Each replication uses a single _reference_, which has already been created.
(See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a Reference].)
To create the replication, you specify:

* The local, source bucket from which data is to be replicated.

* The remote cluster to which data is to be replicated.
This cluster must already be registered on the local cluster as a _reference_.

* The bucket on the remote cluster to which data is to be replicated.

* The XDCR protocol to be used.

* Whether _filtering_ should be used in replication, and if so, according to what regular expression.

* Other _Advanced Replication Settings_, which can be used to optimize replication-performance.

Note that multiple _replications_ (each using a different source-target bucket combination) can be created using a single _reference_ (which refers to a target cluster, but not to any specific bucket on it).

[#examples-on-this-page-create-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create the same replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
As their starting-point, the examples assume the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a Reference], this being:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node.
These are named after their IP addresses: `10.142.180.101` and `10.142.180.102`.

* Each cluster contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample` bucket.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Cluster `10.142.180.101` now has a reference that specifies its own `travel-sample` bucket as a source, and the `travel-sample` bucket on `10.142.180.102` as a target.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the left-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,90,align=left]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, the lower part of the main panel of which is entitled *Outgoing Replications*:
+
[#xdcr-screen-ongoing-replications-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-initial.png[,800,align=left]
+
The list, which is designed to show the name and IP address or hostname of each existing replication, is currently empty, and so bears the notification `There are currently no replications defined. Use ADD REPLICATION to set one up`.

. To start creating a replication, left-click on the
*ADD REPLICATION* button:
+
[#left-click-on-add-replication-button]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-add-replication-button.png[,110,align=left]
+
This brings up the *Add Replication* dialog:
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-dialog.png[,400,align=left]

. Enter appropriate information into the fields of the *Add Replication* dialog.
Specify `10.142.180.102` as the target cluster, and `travel-sample` as both source and target bucket.
At this stage, do not check the `Enable advanced filtering` checkbox, and do not elect to open either *Replication Filters* or *Advanced Replication Settings*.
Note that the *Replication Priority* pulldown menu is currently set to the default, *High*: do not change this.
For information on the significance of the alternative settings &#8212; *Medium* and *Low* &#8212; see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-priority[XDCR Priority].
+
The completed dialog now appears as follows.
+
[#xdcr-add-replication-dialog-complete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-replication-dialog-complete.png[,400,align=left]
+
[#ongoing-replications-with-replication]
. Left-click on the *Save* button.
The *XDCR Replications* screen is now redisplayed, with the appearance of the *Outgoing Replications* panel as follows:
+
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication.png[,800,align=left]
+
This indicates that a replication is now in progress: from `travel-sample` on `this cluster` to `bucket "travel-sample" on cluster "10.142.180.102"`.

This concludes creation of the replication.
Note that by left-clicking on the row for the replication, additional controls can be displayed:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outgoing-replications-with-replication-opened.png[,800,align=left]

Use of the *Pause* control is described in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a Replication]; use of the *Delete* control in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/delete-xdcr-replication.adoc[Delete a Replication]; and use of the *Edit* control in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#editing-filters[Editing Filters].

To see real-time statistics on the current replication, left-click on the *XDCR Stats* tab, at the left:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-statistics.png[,600,align=left]

For information on how to read the interactive charts now displayed, see xref:manage:manage-statistics/manage-statistics.adoc[Manage Statistics].


[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-pointer]
=== Advanced Filtering with the UI

*Advanced Filtering* can be enabled by left-clicking on the *Replication Filters* control, in the *Add Replication* dialog.
The UI expands to reveal the following field:

[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-filter-test-initial.png[,400,align=left]

One or more expressions, to be used as filters, can be entered into the *Filter Expression* field.
The expression is matched against documents' ids, field-names, values, and extended attributes, within the source bucket.
Each document that provides a successful match is replicated.
Documents that do not provide a match are not replicated.

Optionally, a document's _id_ can be entered into the interactive field adjacent to the *Test Filter* button.
When the button is clicked, a match is attempted on the specified document.
If the match is successful, a green *match* notification is displayed; otherwise, an orange *no match* is displayed.

An overview of XDCR filtering is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering].
For reference information on expressions used in advanced filtering, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering Reference].
The practical steps required for establishing filters are explained in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc[Filter a Replication].

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer]
=== Advanced Replication Settings with the UI

Left-click on the *Advanced Replication Settings* control, in the *Add Replication* dialog.
The UI expands vertically, to reveal the following:

[#xdcr-advanced-settings-menu]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-advanced-settings.png[,400,align=left]

The values displayed in the fields are defaults, which can be modified interactively, and saved: this may help in achieving optimal replication-performance.
For details on the significance of each field, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Reference].

[#error-notifications]
=== Error Notifications

If, while a replication is in progress, errors occur, a notification appears adjacent to the status displayed on the row for the replication:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-error-notification.png[,120,align=left]

Left-click on the orange icon, to display a full account of problems:

image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-error-notification-full.png[,400,align=left]

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-cli]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the CLI

Staring from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-replicate` command to create an XDCR replication, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-replicate -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator \
-p password \
--create \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.102 \
--xdcr-from-bucket travel-sample \
--xdcr-to-bucket travel-sample \
--xdcr-replication-mode xmem
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
SUCCESS: XDCR replication created
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[xdcr-replicate] command.
Note that this includes descriptions of all flags that support the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced Settings], described above.

[#create-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-rest-api]
== Create an XDCR Replication with the REST API

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-replication[Examples on This Page], using the REST API's `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI, create an XDCR reference as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d fromBucket=travel-sample \
-d toCluster=10.142.180.102 \
-d toBucket=travel-sample \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d enableCompression=1
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
{"id":"82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1/travel-sample/travel-sample"}
----

For more information, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[Creating XDCR Replications].
For information on REST-driven configuration of the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc#xdcr-advanced-settings-pointer[Advanced Settings] described above, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-adv-settings.adoc[Managing Advanced XDCR Settings].

[#next-xdcr-steps-after-create-replication]
== Next Steps

Once a replication has been defined and is therefore running, you can opt to _pause_ it, in order to perform system maintenance.
See xref:manage:manage-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a Replication].
