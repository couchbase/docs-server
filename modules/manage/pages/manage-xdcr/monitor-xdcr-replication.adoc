[#examples-on-this-page-monitor-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples on this page show how to monitor a replication; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/monitor-xdcr-replication.adoc#monitor-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui[UI].
Examples of monitoring XDCR with the REST API are provided in xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-statistics.adoc[Getting XDCR Stats].
No CLI command is available for general XDCR monitoring.

As their starting-point, the examples for the UI the scenario that concluded the page xref:manage:manage-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a Replication].

[#monitor-an-xdcr-replication-with-the-ui]
== Monitor an XDCR Replication with the UI

Information on current XDCR replications is provided by Couchbase Web Console _per bucket_.
Therefore, to check status, access the *Buckets* screen (rather than the *XDCR* screen).

[#access-buckets-statistics-source]
=== Access Statistics for the Source Bucket

Proceeds as follows:

. Ascertain the name of the XDCR source bucket to be examined.

. In the left-hand navigation panel for the source cluster, left-click on the *Buckets* tab:
+
[#left_click_on_buckets_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-buckets-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This displays the *Buckets* screen.
A single bucket is displayed, `travel-sample` which is the source for replication.
+
[#xdcr-buckets-row-with-bucket]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-buckets-row-with-bucket.png[,800,align=middle]

. Left-click on the `Statistics` tab, which is located at the right-hand side of the row for the bucket:
+
[#xdcr-bucket-statistics-tab]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-bucket-statistics-tab.png[,180,align=middle]
+
The *Statistics* screen is now displayed:
+
[#xdcr-buckets-statistics-screen-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-buckets-statistics-screen-initial.png[,800,align=middle]

. Scroll down the screen, until the *XDCR* statistics headers appear:

+
[#xdcr-buckets-statistics-xdcr-headers]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-buckets-statistics-xdcr-headers.png[,600,align=middle]

. Left-click on the arrow for *Outbound XDCR* operations.
The following graphical display is provided:
+
[#xdcr-outbound-operations-ui-statistics]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-outbound-operations-ui-statistics.png[,600,align=middle]
+
Each of the twelve graphs provides statistical information on the ongoing replication from the source bucket.
Each graph is based on a particular Couchbase Server statistic.
These are:

** _n_ *mutations*: The number of mutations to be replicated to other clusters (measured from the per-replication statistic `changes-left`).

** _n_ *percent completed*: The percentage of checked items out of all checked and to-be-replicated items (measured from the per-replication statistic `percent_completeness`).

** _n_ *mutations replicated*: The number of mutations that have been replicated to other clusters (measured from the per-replication statistic `docs_written`).

** _n_ *mutations filtered per sec*: The number of mutations per second that have been filtered out, and therefore not replicated to other clusters (measured from the per-replication statistic `docs_filtered`).

** _n_ *mutations skipped by resolution*: The number of mutations that failed conflict resolution on the source side, and therefore have not been replicated to other clusters (measured from the per-replication statistic `docs_failed_cr_source`).

** _n_ *mutation replication rate*: The rate of replication, in terms of the number of replicated mutations per second (measured from the per-replication statistic `rate_replicated`).

** _n_ *B data replication rate*: The rate of replication in terms of bytes replicated per second (measured from the per-replication statistic `bandwidth_usage`).

** _n_ *opt. replication rate*: The rate optimistic replications in terms of the number of replicated mutations per second.

** _n_ *docs checks rate*: The rate of document checks per second.

** _n_ *ms meta batch latency*: The weighted average latency is milliseconds of sending getMeta and waiting for a conflict solution result from the remote cluster (measured from the per-replication statistic `wtavg_meta_latency`).

** _n_ *ms doc batch latency*: The weighted average latency in milliseconds of sending replicated mutations to the remote cluster (measured from the per-replication statistic `wtavg_docs_latency`).

** _n_ *doc reception rate*: The rate of mutations received from DCP in terms of the number of mutations per second.

[#access-buckets-statistics-target]
=== Access Statistics for the Target Bucket

Proceed as follows:

. Ascertain the name of the XDCR target bucket to be examined.

. In the left-hand navigation panel for the remote cluster, left-click on the *Buckets* tab, and access the statistics for the bucket according to the steps provided above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/monitor-xdcr-replication.adoc#access-buckets-statistics-source[Access Statistics for the Source Bucket].

. Open the *Incoming XDCR Operations* panel.
The following graphical display is provided:
+
[#xdcr-incoming-operations-graphs]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-incoming-operations-graphs.png[,600,align=middle]
+
Each of the four graphs provides statistical information on an incoming replication from the source bucket:

** _n_ *metadata reads per sec.*: The number of metadata read operations per second for this bucket as the target for XDCR (measured from the statistic `ep_num_ops_get_meta`).

** _n_ *sets per second*: The number of set operations per second for this buckets as the target for XDCR (measured from the statistic `ep_num_ops_set_meta`).

** _n_ *deletes per second*: The number of delte operations per second for this bucket as the target for XDCR (measured from the statistic `ep_num_ops_del_meta`).

** _n_ *total ops per sec*: Total XDCR operations per second for this bucket (measured from the sum of the statistics `ep_num_ops_delmeta`, `ep_num_ops_get_meta`, and `ep_num_ops_set_meta`).

[#pointer-to-monitoring-xdcr-timestamp-conflict-resolution]
== Monitoring Conflict Resolution

xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-conflict-resolution.adoc[XDCR Conflict Resolution] can be monitored by means of the xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats] CLI.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-monitor-timestamp-conflict-resolution.adoc[Monitoring XDCR Timestamp-based Conflict Resolution], for details.
