= Create a Reference

[abstract]
To perform Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR), you start by creating a _reference_ to the remote cluster and bucket that will receive the replicated data.

[#understanding-references]
== Understanding References

A _reference_ is the registration, on the local cluster, of details that identify a remote cluster as a suitable target for XDCR replication.
The reference must contain the following details:

* The name of the remote cluster.

* The IP address or hostname of a node within the remote cluster.

* A username and password, associated on the remote cluster with a role that allows one or more buckets to receive documents from an XDCR replication.
The possible roles are _Full_, and _XDCR Inbound_ (either for the individual bucket that will later be specified as the target bucket for the replication, or for all buckets on the target cluster).
+
Note that the administrator setting up XDCR must have the _Full Admin_, _Cluster Admin_ or _XDCR Admin_ role, on the source cluster.

* Whether the the connection between source and target clusters will be managed securely, and if so, by what secure methodology.
Corresponding TLS certificates may need to be provided.
Securing a connection is described in detail in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc[Secure a Replication].

Once the reference has been saved, it can be used to specify a target cluster, when an XDCR replication is created.

[#examples-on-this-page-create-reference]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create the same reference; using the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui[UI], the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli[CLI], and the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api[REST API] respectively.
The examples assume:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node.
These are named after their IP addresses: `10.142.180.101` and `10.142.180.102`.

* Each cluster contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample` bucket.
To access and install this, see xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of `Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#choosing-a-target-bucket]
=== Choosing a Target Bucket

Since XDCR requires specification of a bucket on the target cluster, to which data is to be replicated, prior to creating a reference to a target cluster, you must know either:

* The name of the existing target bucket to which data will be replicated
* That you have the ability to create a target bucket to which data will be replicated.

The examples on this page use the `travel-sample` bucket, whose installation is described in xref:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].
For information on listing and creating additional buckets, see xref:manage:manage-buckets/bucket-management-overview.adoc[Manage Buckets].

[#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-ui]
== Create an XDCR Reference with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access Couchbase Web Console.
Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the left-hand navigation menu.
+
[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::manage-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen:
+
[#xdcr-replications-screen-initial]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-replications-screen-initial.png[,840,align=left]
+
The upper part of the main panel is entitled *Remote Clusters*.
The list, which is designed to show the name and IP address or hostname of each registered remote cluster, is currently empty, and so bears the notification `No cluster references defined. Use ADD REMOTE to set one up.`

. Define a reference, by left-clicking on the *ADD REMOTE* button, at the upper right.
+
[#xdcr-add-remote-cluster-button]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-remote-cluster-button.png[,110,align=middle]
+
The *Add Remote Cluster* dialog is now displayed:
+
[#xdcr-add-remote-cluster-dialog]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-remote-cluster-dialog.png[,400,align=left]
+
The fields in this dialog are explained above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#understanding-references[Understanding References].

. For *Cluster Name* and *IP/Hostname*, specify the IP address of the second cluster, which is `10.142.180.102`.
(Note that if the IPv6 address family were being used, the IP address would need to be enclosed in square brackets.)
For *Username* and *Password*, specify those stated above.
Do not, for the current example, check the `Enable Secure Connection` checkbox.
The complete dialog appears as follows:
+
[#xdcr-add-remote-cluster-dialog-complete]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-add-remote-cluster-dialog-complete.png[,400,align=left]
+
When you have entered the data, left-click on the *Save* button.
+
The *XDCR Replications* screen is again displayed:
+
[#xdcr-replications-screen-with-reference]
image::manage-xdcr/xdcr-replications-screen-with-reference.png[,800,align=left]
+
The *Remote Clusters* panel now contains the reference you have defined.
A new panel, entitled *Outgoing Replications*, appears immediately below the *Remote Clusters* panel.
It is currently empty, except for a notification explaining that no replications are yet defined.
Note that at the upper right of the *XDCR Replications* screen, a new tab has appeared, which is *ADD REPLICATION*.

This concludes reference-definition.

[#editing-and-deleting-references-with-the-ui]
== Editing and Deleting References with the UI

By left-clicking on the row for a particular, defined reference, buttons for editing and deleting the reference are displayed:

image::manage-xdcr/deleteAndEditReferenceButtons.png[,800,align=left]

Now, by left-clicking on the *Edit* and *Delete* buttons themselves, you can respectively edit (by means of the *Edit Remote Cluster* dialog, which is identical to the *Add Remote Cluster* dialog) and delete defined references.
Note that if a reference is already associated with a replication, you cannot delete the reference; nor can you modify its target IP address.
However, you _can_ change the registered name of the target cluster, and you can change the security settings for the replication.

[#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-cli]
== Create an XDCR Reference with the CLI

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-reference[Examples on This Page], use the CLI `xdcr-setup` command to create an XDCR reference, as follows:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 -u Administrator \
 -p password \
--create \
--xdcr-cluster-name 10.142.180.102 \
--xdcr-hostname 10.142.180.102 \
--xdcr-username Administrator \
--xdcr-password password
----

If successful, this provides the following response:

----
SUCCESS: Cluster reference created
----

Note that a complete list of references established for a cluster can be retrieved with the `xdcr-setup` command, used with the `list` option:

----
couchbase-cli xdcr-setup -c 10.142.180.101 \
-u Administrator -p password --list
----

The following is returned.
Note the `uuid` associated with the reference, which will be used later in the current section.

----
cluster name: 10.142.180.102
        uuid: 82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1
   host name: 10.142.180.102:8091
   user name: Administrator
         uri: /pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102
----

For more information, see the complete reference for the
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-setup.adoc[xdcr-setup] command, which
includes details on how to edit an existing reference.

[#create-an-xdcr-reference-with-the-rest-api]
== Create an XDCR Reference with the REST API

Starting from the scenario defined above, in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc#examples-on-this-page-create-reference[Examples on This Page], using the REST API's `POST /pools/default/remoteClusters` HTTP method and URI, create an XDCR reference as follows:

----
curl -X  POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters \
-d username=Administrator \
-d password=password \
-d hostname=10.142.180.102 \
-d name=10.142.180.102 \
-d demandEncryption=0
----

The output, if formatted, is as follows;

----
{
  "deleted": false,
  "hostname": "10.142.180.102:8091",
  "name": "10.142.180.102",
  "secureType": "none",
  "uri": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102",
  "username": "Administrator",
  "uuid": "82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1",
  "validateURI": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102?just_validate=1"
}
----

To return a list of the cluster's current references, use the method as follows:

----
curl -i -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.101:8091/pools/default/remoteClusters
----

Formatted, the output is as follows:

----
{
  "deleted": false,
  "hostname": "10.142.180.102:8091",
  "name": "10.142.180.102",
  "secureType": "none",
  "uri": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102",
  "username": "Administrator",
  "uuid": "82026f90f5f573b5e50ec8b7a7012ab1",
  "validateURI": "/pools/default/remoteClusters/10.142.180.102?just_validate=1"
}
----
