= Setting recovery type

[abstract]
Node recover type is set with the `POST /controller/setRecoverType` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP method and URI

Sets the recovery type to be performed for a node.
Recovery options are delta node recovery or full recovery.
The recovery type for a node is set after the node is failed over and before rebalance.
Rebalance is required to apply the recovery.

----
POST /controller/setRecoveryType
----

The progress of setting recovery type can be tracked just like rebalance.
After the data is persisted to disk and replicas are up-to-date, the node is put into the failed over state.

== Syntax

----
POST /controller/setRecoveryType
    otpNode=[node@hostname]
    recoveryType=[full|delta]
----

== Example

The following Curl request example sets delta node recovery.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.5.2.118' -d 'recoveryType=delta' \
http://10.5.2.54:8091/controller/setRecoveryType
----

== Response codes
