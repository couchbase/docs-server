= Logs API

[abstract]
The Logs REST API provides the REST API endpoints for retrieving log and diagnostic information as well as how an SDK can add entries into a log.

== Description

Couchbase Server logs various messages, which are available via the REST API.
These log messages are optionally categorized by the module.
A generic list of log entries or log entries for a particular category can be retrieved.

NOTE: If the system is secured, administrator credentials are required to access logs.
