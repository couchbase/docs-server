= Establishing Auto-Compaction Settings
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Auto-compaction settings can be established for the cluster.

== Description

Auto-Compaction settings determine the compaction process; whereby databases and their respective view-indexes are compacted.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/setAutoCompaction

== Syntax

Curl syntax is as follows:

== Controller Parameters

[cols="20,20"]
|===
| Function | Description

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the database fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of database fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the view fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of view fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute (within the specified starting hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute (within the specified concluding hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

| `parallelDBAndViewCompaction`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction of databases and views _should_ or _should not_ run in parallel.

| `purgeInterval`
| The frequency with which the _tombstone purge_ is run, specified as either an integer or a decimal number.
If a decimal is specified, the fractional part is rounded at fifteen places.
The default value is 3.0; the minimum 0.04; the maximum 60.

| `indexCompactionMode`
| The compaction mode for indexes.
Can be either `standard` or `circular`.

| `indexCircularCompaction[daysOfWeek]`
| The days of the week on which circular compaction (if specified) is to run.
Individual values must be day-names, each specified with an initial capital, and otherwise lower-case: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`.
Multiple values must be separated by a single comma, with no spaces.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute of the time-period, within the specified starting hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute of the time-period, within the specified concluding hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that circular index compaction, if specified, _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

This example establishes fragmentation thresholds and sizes for database and view, and specifies the time-period during which compaction should occur.
It specifies that compaction be aborted if it should overrun this time-period.
Parallel compaction for database and view is switched _off_.
The tombstone purge interval is set to 3 days; and _circular_ standard compaction is specified for particular days and hours.
