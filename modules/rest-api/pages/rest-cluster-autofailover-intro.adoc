 `enabled=[true|false]`.
Enables or disables automatic failover.
 `timeout=`_number-of-seconds_.
Integer between 5 and 3600.
Specifies the number of seconds that must elapse after a node has become unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
 `count=[0|1]`.
Determines whether any node in a cluster can be automatically failed-over.
After one auto-failover occurs, the count is set to 1, and Couchbase Server does not perform another auto-failover for the cluster until the count is reset to 0.
Note that to fail over more than one node at a time, a _manual_ failover is required.
