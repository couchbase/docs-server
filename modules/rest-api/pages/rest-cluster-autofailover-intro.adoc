| HTTP method | URI path | Description

| GET
| [.path]_/settings/autoFailover_
a|
Retrieves automatic-failover settings.
Uses the following parameters:

* `enabled`.
Indicates whether automatic failover is enabled (a value of `true`) or disabled (a value of `false`).
* `timeout`.
Returns an integer between 5 and 3600, which specifies the number of seconds set to elapse, after a node has become unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
* `count`.
This parameter represents how many nodes have auto-failed over since the parameter was itself last reset, to a value of 0, through administrator intervention.

| POST
| [.path]_/settings/autoFailover_
a|
Enables and disables automatic failover.
Uses the following paramenters:

* `enabled=[true{vbar}false]`.
Enables or disables automatic failover.
* `timeout=` _number-of-seconds_.
Integer between 5 and 3600.
Specifies the number of seconds that must elapse after a node has become unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
* `maxCount=` _number-of-nodes_.
Specifies the number of nodes that are auto-failed over before user intervention is required.
An _event_ might consist of one node failing over; or alternatively, of an entire server group failing over.
The maximum allowed value is three.
The default value is one.
* `failoverServerGroup=[true{vbar}false]&maxCount=` _number-of-seconds_.
Enables or disables automatic failover for server groups, and specifies the number of seconds that must elapse after a node has become unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
Do not enable failover for server groups unless you have set up three of more server groups, and have the capacity to absorb the load of any failed-over group.
* `failoverOnDataDiskIssues[enabled]=[true{vbar}false]&failoverOnDataDiskIssues[timePeriod]=` _number-of-seconds_.
Integer between 5 and 3600.
Enables or disables automatic failover for any sustained disk read/write failure, after the specied time-period has elapsed

| POST
| [.path]_/settings/autoFailover/resetCount_
| Resets automatic failover count to 0.

== Auto-Failover and Durability

Couchbase Server provides _durability_, which ensures the greatest likelihood of data-writes surviving unexpected anomalies, such as node-outages.
The auto-failover maximum should be established to support guarantees of durability.
See xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability], for information.
