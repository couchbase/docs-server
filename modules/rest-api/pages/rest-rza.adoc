This enables logical server-groupings to be defined across the cluster: each group may be physically located on a specific rack or availability zone.

_Server Group Awareness_, which is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, provides enhanced availability.
Specifically, it protects a cluster from large-scale infrastructure failure, through the definition of _groups_.
Each group is created by an appropriately authorized administrator, and specified to contain a subset of the nodes within a Couchbase Cluster.
Following group-definition and rebalance, the active vBuckets for any defined bucket are located on one group, while the corresponding replicas are located on another group.
This allows _Group Failover_ to be enabled, so that if an entire group goes offline, its replica vBuckets, which remain available on another group, can be automatically promoted to active status.
