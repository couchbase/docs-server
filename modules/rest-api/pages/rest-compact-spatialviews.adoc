= Compacting Spatial Views

[abstract]
Spatial views are compacted with the `POST /[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_spatial/_compact ` HTTP method and URI.

== Description

Spatial views are not automatically compacted with data and indexes.
Instead, each spatial view must be manually compacted.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_spatial/_compact
----

== Syntax

To compact each spatial view, specify the compaction for the spatial view:

----
http://[localhost]:8092/[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_spatial/_compact
----

This URL contains the following information:

* `[localhost]:8092`
+
`localhost` is the IP address for the local host.
The port number, 8092, is unique to the spatial indexing system.

* `bucket_name`
+
The name of the bucket where the design document is configured.

* `ddoc_name`
+
The name of the design document that contains the spatial index or indexes that you want to compact.

== Example

To send a request using curl:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:8092/default/_design/dev_test_spatial_compaction/_spatial/_compact \
  -H 'Content-type: application/json'
