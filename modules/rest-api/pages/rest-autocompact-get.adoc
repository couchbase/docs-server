= Getting Auto-Compaction Settings

[abstract]
Auto-compaction settings can be retrieved on a cluster-wide level or bucket level.

== HTTP method and URI

Auto-compaction settings can be configured for all buckets on a cluster-wide basis or for a specific bucket on the bucket-level

----
// Cluster-wide
GET /settings/autoCompaction

// Bucket-level
GET /pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]
----

== Cluster-wide syntax

To retrieve current auto-compaction settings for a cluster:

----
curl -u [admin]:[password] http://[localhost]:8091/settings/autoCompaction
----

Replace the _admin_, _password_, and _localhost_ values in the above example with your actual values.

This results in a JSON response as follows:

== Cluster-wide example

The following example requests auto-compaction information on a cluster-wide level.
GET is not specified because it is the default HTTP method.

----
curl -u Administrator:password \ 
  http://127.0.0.1:8091/settings/autoCompaction
----

== Cluster-wide response

This example response shows a `purgeInterval` of three days and no current thresholds set for data or index compaction.
The field `parallelDBAndViewCompaction: false` indicates that the cluster will not perform data and index compaction in parallel.

        "databaseFragmentationThreshold": {
            "percentage": undefined, 
            "size": "undefined"
        }, 
        "parallelDBAndViewCompaction": false, 
        "viewFragmentationThreshold": {
            "percentage": undefined, 
            "size": "undefined"
        }
    }, 
    "purgeInterval": 3
}
----

== Bucket-level syntax

To see auto-compaction settings for a single bucket, use this request:

----
curl -u admin:password http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/buckets/[bucket_name]
----

Replace the _admin_, _password_, _localhost_, and _bucket_name_ values in the above example with your actual values.

== Bucket-level example

The following example requests auto-compaction information for the bucket, test2.
GET is not specified because it is the default HTTP method.

----
curl -u Administrator:password 
  http://10.5.2.117:8091/pools/default/buckets/test2
----

== Bucket-level response

This example response shows the following:

* A time interval set (from 1:00 am to 2:00 am) for when compaction can run.
* Abort enabled (true) if the run time exceeds the set time interval.
* Database and view fragmentation threshold set at 30%.
* A tombstone purge interval set to two (2) days>.
This means items can be expired for two days or deleted two days ago and their tombstones will be purged during the next cluster-wide auto-compaction run.
