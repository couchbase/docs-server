== APIs in this Section

The Backup Service API endpoints can be grouped into several categories: 

* xref:#cluster[Cluster]
* xref:#configuration[Configuration]
* xref:#repository[Repository]
* xref:#plan[Plan]
* xref:#task[Task]
* xref:#data[Data]

For an overview of the Backup Service, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc[Backup Service].
For information on using Couchbase Server Web Console to configure and use the Backup Service, see xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc[Manage Backup and Restore].

All calls require the Full Admin role, and use port `8097`.
Each URI, in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition Version 7.0, must be prefixed with `/api/v1`.
Note that for all cluster references, in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition Version 7.0 and 7.1, only the host cluster is supported, and is referred to as `self`.

For a list of the methods and URIs covered in these pages, see the tables below.
