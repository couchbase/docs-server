= Dropping a Collection
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Scopes can be _dropped_, by means of the REST API.

== Description

Collections are dropped by means of the `DELETE /pools/default/buckets/_<bucket_name>_/collections/_<scope_name>_/_<collection_name>_` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP Method and URI

----
DELETE /pools/default/buckets/<bucket_name>/collections/<scope_name>/<collection_name>
----

== Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X DELETE -v -u [admin]:[password]
  http://<hostname-or-ip>:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
    <bucket-name>/collections/<scope-name>/<collection-name>
----

The `<bucket-name>` path-parameter specifies the bucket whose collection is to be dropped.
The `<scope-name>` path-parameter specifies the scope that contains the collection that is to be dropped.
The `<collection-name>` path-parameter specifies the name of the collection that is to be dropped.

Success returns `200 OK` and a UID.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
If the scope-name or collection-name is improperly specified, a notification such as `"name":"Length must be in range from 1 to 30"` or `"name":"Can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the following symbols _ - %"` is displayed.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections], for an account of naming conventions.

curl -X DELETE -v -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.210.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
testBucket/collections/my_scope/my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
