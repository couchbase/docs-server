== HTTP method and URI

The auto-failover setting is global, and therefore applies to all nodes in the cluster.
Setting-changes require authentication.

----
POST /settings/autoFailover
----

The following parameters are used:

* `enabled=[true|false]`.
Enables or disables automatic failover.
Default setting is `false`.
* `timeout=`_number-of-seconds_.
Integer between 5 and 3600.
Specifies the number of seconds that must elapse, with a node unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
Default setting is 120.
* `maxCount=`_number-of-events_.
Specifies the maximum number of sequential auto-failover events to be handled before administrator-intervention is required.
An _event_ might consist of one node failing over; or alternatively, of an entire server group failing over.
The maximum allowed value is 3.
The default value is 1.
This parameter is only supported by Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
* `failoverServerGroup=[true|false]`.
Enables or disables automatic failover for server groups.
Do not enable failover for server groups unless you have set up three or more server groups, and have the capacity to absorb the load of any failed-over group.
This parameter is ignored if the value of the `enabled` parameter for automatic failover is `false`.
Default setting is `false`.
This parameter is only supported by Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
* `failoverOnDataDiskIssues[enabled]=[true|false]&failoverOnDataDiskIssues[timePeriod]=`_number-of-seconds_.
When `enabled` is `true`, `timePeriod` is an integer between 5 and 3600: such settings allow automatic failover to be triggered when disk read-write attempts have failed continuously throughout at least 60% of the specied time-period.
The default for `enabled` is `false`.
If `enabled` is `true`, the default `timePeriod` is 120 seconds.
If `enabled` is `false` and the `timePeriod` is explicitly specified, an error is returned.
This parameter and its values are ignored if the value of the `enabled` parameter for automatic failover is `false`.
This parameter is only supported by Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.
