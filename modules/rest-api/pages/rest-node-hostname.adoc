== Description

Host names are provided when you install a Couchbase Server node, when you add it to an existing cluster for online upgrade, or via a REST API call.
If a node restarts, any host name that you established is used.
A host name cannot be provided for a node that is already part of a Couchbase Server cluster.

IMPORTANT: Host names must be specified prior to being added to a cluster.

== Response

If you attempt to specify a host name once the node is in the cluster, the server rejects the request and returns the following:

----
error 400 reason: unknown ["Renaming is disallowed
        for nodes that are already part of a cluster"]
----
