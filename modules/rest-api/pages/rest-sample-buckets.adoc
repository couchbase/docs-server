== Description

Couchbase Server allows _sample buckets_ to be installed, and then used for development and testing.

== HTTP methods and URIs

The following methods and URIs respectively allow the names of the currently available sample buckets to be retrieved, and one or more to be installed on the cluster.

----
GET /sampleBuckets

POST /sampleBuckets/install
----

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u [username]:[password]
  http://[node-name-or-ip-address]:8091/sampleBuckets

curl -X POST -u [username]:[password]
  http://[node-name-or-ip-address]:8091/sampleBuckets/install
  -d '[ <bucketname>, <bucketname> ]'
----

The `node-name-or-ip-address` can be that of any node in the cluster.
Each `bucketname` must be the name of an available sample bucket, specified as a string.

== Responses

If the GET is successful, `200 OK` is given, and an object describing available sample buckets is returned.
If the POST is successful, `200 OK` is given, and an empty message-list is returned.
In either case, an incorrectly specified bucket-name or URI gives `404 Object Not Found`; and failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

Incorrectly using the POST to install one or more sample buckets that are already installed returns a list containing a message for each error; such as `["Sample bucket travel-sample is already loaded.","Sample bucket beer-sample is already loaded."]`.

== Examples

The following example retrieves a list of the currently available sample buckets.
Note that the output is piped to the https://https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] program, to facilitate readability.

----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.194.101:8091/sampleBuckets | jq
----

If successful, the call returns output such as the following:

----
[
  {
    "name": "beer-sample",
    "installed": false,
    "quotaNeeded": 104857600
  },
  {
    "name": "gamesim-sample",
    "installed": false,
    "quotaNeeded": 104857600
  },
  {
    "name": "travel-sample",
    "installed": false,
    "quotaNeeded": 104857600
  }
]
----

Each available bucket is listed, along with its current install-status (`true` or `false`).
The memory quota required for each bucket, in Bytes, is also stated: note that this minimum must be available even though the actual sample bucket might not, with its default content, require it all.

The following example installs the `travel-sample` and `beer-sample` sample buckets:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.194.101:8091/sampleBuckets/install \
-d '["travel-sample", "beer-sample"]'
----

If successful, the call returns an empty list.
