= Create a Repository

[abstract]
The Backup Service REST API allows repositories to be created.

[#http-methods-and-uris]
== HTTP Methods and URIs

----
POST /cluster/self/repository/active/<new-repository-name>
----

[#description]
== Description

The `POST` http method and `/cluster/self/repository/active/<new-repository-name>` create a new repository.
The call must specify a _plan_, as a JSON payload: for information on defining a plan, see xref:rest-api:backup-create-and-edit-plans.adoc[Create and Edit Plans].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST /cluster/self/repository/active/<new-repository-name> \
-u <username>:<password> \
-d <repository-definition>
----

The `new-repository-name` path-parameter must be a name for the new repository: this name must be unique for repositories across the cluster.
The `username` and `password` must be those of a user with the `Full Admin` role.

The `repository-definition` contains the following:

* `id`.
The repository-name, unique for repositories across the cluster.

* `plan`.
A defined _plan_.
For information, see xref:rest-api:backup-create-and-edit-plans.adoc[Create and Edit Plans].

* `archive`.
A defined _archive_.
This must be a location on a filesystem, or on a cloud, that is not used for any other repository.
The location must be accessible from all nodes on the cluster that run the Backup Service.

* `bucket_name`.
Optionally, the name of a specific bucket, defined on the cluster.
If the bucket-name is provided, only data for this bucket is backed up.
If no bucket-name is provided, data for all buckets on the cluster is backed up.

Syntactically therefore, a filesystem-based `repository-definition`, which specifies an individual bucket, is as follows:

----
{
  "id": <new-repository-name,
  "plan": <existing-plan>,
  "archive": <path-to-storage-location>,
  "bucket_name": <individual-bucket-name>
}
----

=== Cloud-Specific Parameters

The following, additional parameters are provided, for defining a repository that uses cloud-based storage:

* `cloud_credential_name`.
A string that is a set of registered credentials for the cloud.
If this is not specified, and cloud-storage is to be accessed, either the `cloud_credentials_key` or the `cloud_credentials_id` must be specified instead.

* `cloud_staging_dir`.
The location to be used as a staging directory.
This _must_ be specified, if cloud storage is to be used.

* `cloud_credentials_id`.
An ID used to connect to object store.
For AWS, this is the _access key id_.

* `cloud_credentials_key`.
A secret key used to connect to object store.
For AWS, this is the _AWS secret access key_.

* `cloud_credentials_region`.
The AWS Region for the repository.
For example, `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`.

* `cloud_endpoint`.
If provided, this overrides the default endpoint used for the cloud provider.

* `cloud_force_path_style`.
When provided, and using S3 or S3 compatible storages, this enforces the _old_ S3 path style.

[#responses]
== Responses

Successful repository-creation returns `200 OK`; with the message, `The repository was created`.
If the repository is incorrectly specified, `400` is returned; with the message, `The request body is invalid`.
If the specified plan is not located, `404` is returned; with the message, `The plan could not be found`.
If an internal error causes the call the fail, `500` is returned; with the message `Failed to create repository due to internal error`.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.
An incorrectly specified method returns `404 Object Not Found`, and returns the object `{"status":404,"msg":"requested plan not found"}`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following call creates a new repository named `testRepo`.
Its plan is to be the default, system-provided plan, `_hourly_backups`; and the data to be backed up is specified as from the `trave-sample` bucket only.

----
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/active/testRepo \
-u Administrator:password -d '{"plan":"_hourly_backups","archive":"/Users/user/Documents/archives/testRepo","bucket_name":"travel-sample"}'
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`.
