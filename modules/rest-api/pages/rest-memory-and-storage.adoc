== APIs in this Section

Using the REST API, _memory quotas_ can be allocated to services, and the current allocations retrieved.
During cluster initialization, the _on-disk paths_ for services can be specified on a _per node_ basis.

_Reader and writer threads_ can be configured, to ensure that disk access is highly performant.

Additionally, _compaction_ can be managed: this is used by Couchbase Server to relocate on-disk data; so as to ensure the data's closest-possible proximity, and thereby reclaim fragments of unused disk-space.
The periodic compaction of a bucket's data helps to ensure the ongoing efficiency of both reads and writes.

Administrators can initiate the compaction of a single bucket's data at any time, and can cancel such compaction if and when necessary.
The REST APIs that support this are described in xref:rest-api:rest-compact-post.adoc[Performing Compaction Manually].

Additionally, settings are provided whereby compaction is triggered _automatically_, according to a specified configuration and schedule.
This _auto-compaction_ can be achieved in two ways:

* _Globally_, meaning that all buckets in the cluster are compacted according to the same configuration and schedule &#8212; with the exception of those buckets for which these default settings are deliberately overridden.
The REST APIs that support global auto-compaction are described in xref:rest-api:rest-autocompact-global.adoc[Auto-Compaction: Global].

* _Per bucket_, meaning that a specified bucket is automatically compacted according to a different configuration and schedule than those established as the global defaults.
The REST APIs that support per-bucket auto-compaction are described in xref:rest-api:rest-autocompact-per-bucket.adoc[Auto-Compaction: Per Bucket].

The methods and URIs covered in this section are listed in the table below.
