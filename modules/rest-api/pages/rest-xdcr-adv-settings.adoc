----
POST /settings/replications/

POST /settings/replications/<settings_URI>

GET /settings/replications/

GET /settings/replications/<settings_URI>

[#description]
== Description

Used with the `POST` method, the URIs respectively change global settings for _all_ replications; and for _a specific_ replication, which is referenced by its `settings_URI`.
The `settings_URI` comprises the _id_ for the replication.

The global settings are the default values used if settings are not specified during the creation of a particular replication.
If settings are specified for a particular replication, the specified settings overwrite the global settings.

If the global settings are themselves changed, existing replications are not affected: only replications created _after_ the change made to the global settings receive the updated global settings.

Used with the `GET` method, the URIs respectively retrieve global settings for _all_ replications; and for _a specific_ replication, which is referenced by its `settings_URI`.

Each command requires the Full Admin, Cluster Admin, ReadOnly Admin, External User Security Admin, Local User Security Admin, Backup Full Admin, or XDCR Admin role.

[#responses]
== Responses

If successful, `GET` and `POST` commands return `200 OK`.
Commands for establishing or retrieving either global settings or the settings for a specific replication or return an object containing the settings.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
A URI featuring an incorrect hostname or port returns a `failure to connect` message.
An incorrect `settings_URI` returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object such as `{"errors":{"_":"requested resource not found"}}`.

An attempt to set a global-only setting for a specific replication returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object indicating which submitted parameters were incorrect.
For example, the attempted use of `POST /settings/replications/<settings_URI>` to establish values for `goGC` and `goMaxProcs` returns the following:

----
{
  "gogc": "Invalid settings key",
  "gomaxprocs": "Invalid settings key"
}
----

A replication-specific parameter (such as `pauseRequested`) is ignored, if incorrectly specified in an attempt to modify global settings.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following examples show how settings can be established and retrieved.

=== Get Settings for All Replications

The following example retrieves settings for all replications.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] command, to facilitate readability:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/replications | jq '.'
----

If successful, the call returns an object similar to the following:

----
{
  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "compressionType": "Auto",
  "desiredLatency": 50,
  "docBatchSizeKb": 2048,
  "failureRestartInterval": 10,
  "filterBypassExpiry": false,
  "filterDeletion": false,
  "filterExpiration": false,
  "goGC": 100,
  "goMaxProcs": 4,
  "hlvPruningWindowSec": 259200,
  "jsFunctionTimeoutMs": 20000,
  "logLevel": "Info",
  "mergeFunctionMapping": {},

  "sourceNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "statsInterval": 1000,
  "targetNozzlePerNode": 2,
  "workerBatchSize": 500
}

----

=== Get Settings for a Specific Replication

To reference a specific replication, the replication's `settings_URI` must first be retrieved.
Use the following call, which is explained in detail in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].
Note that the call pipes output to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] program, to facilitate the readability of output.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/tasks | jq '.'
----

If successful, the call returns an array of ongoing cluster tasks, similar to the following:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "2bbbeac0668c700f43ad694361e1a948",
    "type": "rebalance",

== XDCR Advanced Settings

The advanced settings for XDCR are as follows.
The subset of advanced settings that can be configured by means of Couchbase Web Console is provided at xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc[XDCR Advanced Settings].

.XDCR Advanced Settings
[#table_xdcr_settings,cols="140,80,200"]
|===
| Parameter | Value | Description

| `checkpointInterval`
| Integer (60 to 14400)
| Default: 600
The interval for checkpointing in seconds.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `colMappingRules`
| JSON Object
| Collection-related rules according to which explicit mapping or migration is defined for the replication.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc#rules-for-explicit-mappings[Rules for Explicit Mappings] and xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc#rules-for-migration[Rules for Migration].

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.

| `collectionsExplicitMapping`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Whether the replication uses explicit mapping: see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc#rules-for-explicit-mappings[Rules for Explicit Mappings].

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.

| `collectionsMigrationMode`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Whether the replication uses migration mode: see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc#migration[Migration].

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.

| `collectionsOSOMode`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Whether the replication optimizes performance; by streaming, from a source bucket, mutations that could be out of order, in terms of sequence-number.
Default is true.

| `compressionType`
| String
| Default: `Auto`.
Specifies whether documents are to be compressed for XDCR, and if so, what compression type is to be used.
For information, see xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc#table-of-xdcr-advanced-settings[XDCR Advanced Settings].

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `desiredLatency`
| Integer
| Specifies the amount of time in milliseconds within which a high-priority replication's currently remaining changes should be reduced in number to zero, by ongoing transmission of the changes from source to target bucket.
If Couchbase Server estimates that the time required is greater than that specified by `desiredLatency`, the replication is considered to be backlogged: XDCR therefore attempts to communicate with the Data Service, to establish a higher DCP priority for the replication, and thereby ensure swifter transmission of data.

This setting applies only to high-priority replications, or to medium-priority replications that achieve high-priority status (see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-priority[XDCR Priority]).
The default value is 50.
The lower the value, the higher (potentially) the transmission rate, and the greater the load on the target cluster.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `docBatchSizeKb`
| Integer (10 to 10000)
| Default: 2048.
The size of a batch in kilobytes.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `failureRestartInterval`
| Integer (1 to 300)
| Default: 10.
The number of seconds to wait after a failure before restarting replication.
This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `filterBypassExpiry`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Default: false.
Whether a document's TTL should be replicated with the document or not.
A value of true means that the TTL is removed from the document.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `filterDeletion`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Default: false.
Whether mutations corresponding to the deletion of documents on the source cluster should be either _filtered out_ of the replication to the target cluster, or allowed to remain in.
A value of true means that the mutation _is_ filtered out, ensuring that it is _not_ replicated to the target cluster; while a value of false means that the mutation is _not_ filtered out, ensuring that it _is_ replicated to the target cluster.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `filterExpiration`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Default: false.
Whether mutations corresponding to the expiration of documents on the source cluster should be either _filtered out_ of the replication to the target cluster, or allowed to remain in.
A value of true means that the mutation _is_ filtered out, ensuring that it is _not_ replicated to the target cluster; while a value of false (the default) means that the mutation is _not_ filtered out, ensuring that it _is_ replicated to the target cluster.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `filterExpression`
| String (a filter expression)
| Default: null.
A filter expression to be matched against the ids, field-names, values, and extended attributes of documents in the source bucket.
Each document that produces a successful match is replicated; other documents are not replicated.
For supported expressions, see xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering Reference].

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.

| `goGC`
| Integer (0 to 100) or String ("off")
| Default: 100.
The initial garbage collection target percentage for the replication.
A garbage collection is triggered when the ratio of freshly allocated data to live data remaining after the previous collection reaches this percentage.
A value of "off" disables the garbage collector entirely.

This setting is only returned when global settings are retrieved; and can only be set when global settings are set.
It cannot be set when an individual replication is created, or when its settings are modified.

| `goMaxProcs`
| Integer
| Default: 4.
The maximum number of threads used per node, to support XDCR.
A greater number of threads increases parallelism, and may thereby produce enhanced XDCR performance.

This setting is only returned when global settings are retrieved; and can only be set when global settings are set.
It cannot be set when an individual replication is created, or when its settings are modified.

| `hlvPruningWindowSec`
| Integer
| Used in _custom conflict-resolution_, and available in Developer Preview Mode only.
The integer specifies the duration, in seconds, of the time-window that starts when a remote cluster has modified the document that is currently being replicated.
The remote cluster's update is recorded in a _Hybrid Logical Vector_ (HLV).
If the specified time-window expires without further modification being made by the remote cluster, information about the remote cluster's update is removed from the HLV.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `jsFunctionTimeoutMs`
| Integer
| Used in _custom conflict-resolution_, and available in Developer Preview Mode only.
Specifies the number of milliseconds that must elapse before the timeout of a JavaScript conflict-resolution function.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `logLevel`
| String
| Default: `Info`.
The level of logging, such as `Error`/`Info`/`Debug`/`Trace`.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `mergeFunctionMapping`
| JSON Object
| This is available in Developer Preview Mode only.
Each of the key-value pairs in the JSON object should map a collection-specifier (in the form `scope.collection`) to the name of a defined merge-function.

| `networkUsageLimit`
| Integer
| Default: 0.
Specifies the upper limit for network usage during replication, for the entire cluster, in MB per second.
The default is 0, meaning no limit is applied.
For information, see xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc#table-of-xdcr-advanced-settings[XDCR Advanced Settings].

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `optimisticReplicationThreshold`
| Integer (0 to (20*1024*1024))
| Default: 256.
Documents with sizes less than this threshold (in bytes) will be replicated optimistically.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `pauseRequested`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Default: false.
Indicates whether the replication has been issued a pause request.

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.

| `priority`
| High, Medium, or Low
| Default: High.
Resource-allocation for the replication.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-priority[XDCR Priority].

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `retryOnRemoteAuthErr`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Whether to retry connection for a replication that has failed due to a problem in authenticating with the target cluster.
The default is true.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `retryOnRemoteAuthErrMaxWaitSec`
| Integer
| The maximum number of seconds to wait before retrying a connection that failed due to a problem in authenticating with the target cluster.
This only takes effect when `retryOnRemoteAuthErr` is true.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `sourceNozzlePerNode`
| Integer (1 to 100)
| The number of nozzles that can be used for this replication per source cluster node.
This together with `target_nozzle_per_node` controls the parallelism of the replication.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `statsInterval`
| Integer (200 to 600000)
| Default: 1000.
The interval (in milliseconds) for statistics updates.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `targetNozzlePerNode`
| Integer (1 to 100)
| The number of outgoing nozzles per target node.
This together with `source_nozzle_per_node` controls the parallelism of the replication.

This setting can be established and retrieved either for an individual replication or globally.

| `type`
| String "xmem"
| The replication type, which must be "xmem".

This setting can only be established for and retrieved from an individual replication: it cannot be established or retrieved as part of global settings.
