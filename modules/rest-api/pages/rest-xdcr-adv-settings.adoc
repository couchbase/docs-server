[#rest-xdcr-adv-settings]
= Managing advanced XDCR settings

[abstract]
The XDCR advanced settings can change replication behavior, performance, and timing.

== HTTP method and URI

The URI endpoints are available to change global settings for cluster replications and to change settings for a specific replication ID.

----
POST /settings/replications/
POST /settings/replications/[replication_id]
----

The global settings are used for new replications only: if we change a global setting, the existing replications are not affected.
Only replications that are created after the change will get the updated Global setting.

.XDCR URI paths for settings
[#table_xdcr_settings_uri,cols="20,27"]
|===
| URI path | Description

| [.path]_/settings/replications/_
| Global setting supplied to all replications for a cluster.

| [.path]_/settings/replications/[replication-id]_
| Settings for a specific replication for a bucket.
|===

== Syntax

Curl request syntax:

----
curl -u [admin]:[password] -X GET http://[localhost]:8091/settings/replication
curl -u [admin]:[password] -X GET http://[localhost]:8091/settings/replication/[replication-id]
----

== Example

The following example retrieves all replication settings:

----
GET /settings/replications
----

----
// Curl example
curl -u Administrator:password 10.5.2.54:8091/settings/replications

// Results

== XDCR advanced settings

The following parameters are used for setting all replications globally or setting a specific replication ID.

.XDCR advanced settings
[#table_xdcr_settings,cols="100,110,229"]
|===
| Parameter | Value | Description

| `checkpointInterval`
| Integer (60 to 14400).
| Default: 1800.
The interval for checkpointing in seconds.

| `docBatchSizeKb`
| Integer (10 to 10000)
| Default: 2048.
The size of a batch in kilobytes.

| `failureRestartInterval`
| Integer (1 to 300)
| Default: 10.
The number of seconds to wait after a failure before restarting replication.

| `logLevel``log.LogLevel`
| String
| Default: `Info`.
The level of logging, such as `Error`/`Info`/`Debug`/`Trace`.

| `optimisticReplicationThreshold`
| Integer (0 to (20*1024*1024))
| Default: 256.
Documents with sizes less than this threshold (in bytes) will be replicated optimistically.

| `pauseRequested`
| Boolean (true or false)
| Shows whether the replications needs to be paused.

| `sourceNozzlePerNode`
| Integer (1-100)
| The number of nozzles that can be used for this replication per source cluster node.
This together with `target_nozzle_per_node` controls the parallelism of the replication.

| `statsInterval`
| Integer (200-600000)
| Default: 1000.
The interval (in milliseconds) for statistics updates.

| `targetNozzlePerNode`
| Integer (1-100)
| The number of outgoing nozzles per target node.
This together with `source_nozzle_per_node` controls the parallelism of the replication.

| `workerBatchSize`
| Integer (500 to 10000)
| Default: 500.
The number of mutations in a batch.
