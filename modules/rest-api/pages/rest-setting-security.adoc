== HTTP Method and URI

----
GET /settings/security/[service-name]

POST /settings/security/[service-name]
----

== Description

Allows settings to be established for the use of encryption.
This includes the encryption _level_, for node-to-node encryption within the cluster;
UI disablement over insecure connections; TLS minimum version; and a list of accepted cipher suites.
Additionally, secure communication by means of TLS can be _enforced_ across the cluster.

Note that information on setting an HTTP Secure Transport Header with the REST API is provided in xref:rest-api:rest-setting-hsts.adoc[Configure HSTS].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/settings/security/[service-name]

curl -X POST -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/settings/security/[service-name]
  -d disableUIOverHttp=<true|false>
  -d disableUIOverHttps=<true|false>
  -d disableWWWAuthenticate=<true|false>
  -d clusterEncryptionLevel=<all|control|strict>
  -d tlsMinVersion=<tlsv1|tlsv1.1|tlsv1.2|tlsv1.3>
  -d honorCipherOrder=<true|false>
  -d cipherSuites=<list-of-accepted-cipher-suites>
----

The syntax for the `GET` and `POST` methods includes the following:

* `service-name`.
If provided, determines the service to which settings are either written with `POST`, or read with `GET`.
The value of `service-name` can be any one of the following: `data` (Data Service), `fullTextSearch` (Search Service), `index` (Index Service), `eventing` (Eventing Service), `query` (Query Service), `analytics` (Analytics Service), `backup` (Backup Service), `clusterManager` (Cluster Manager).
If no `service-name` is provided, _global_ settings are written or read.

* `disableUIOverHttp`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over http.
Default is `false`, meaning that the console can be accessed over http.
This parameter can only be set globally.

* `disableUIOverHttps`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over https.
Default is `false`, meaning that the console can be accessed over https.
This parameter can only be set globally.

* `disableWWWAuthenticate`.
Whether to disable Couchbase Server's responding to unauthenticated requests with _WWW-Authenticate_.
Default is `false`, meaning that Couchbase Server responds to unauthenticated requests with _WWW-Authenticate_.
This parameter can only be set globally.

* `clusterEncryptionLevel`.
Controls the level of encryption imposed on cluster-communications.
This can only be set after cluster encryption has been enabled (see xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption]) and can only be set globally.
Its value can be any of the following:

** `control`, meaning that server-management information passed between nodes is passed in encrypted form.

** `all`, meaning that all information passed between nodes, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form.

** `strict`, meaning `all` with only encrypted communication permitted between nodes and between the cluster and external clients.
This is available only in Couchbase Server Version 7.0.2 and later.
Note that after `strict` has been specified, communication that occurs entirely on a single node using the _loopback_ interface (whereby the machine is identified as either `::1` or `127.0.0.1`) is still permitted in non-encrypted form.
+
Before applying `strict`, see xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc#enforcing-tls[Enforcing TLS], below.

* `tlsMinVersion`.
Specifies the minimum TLS version accepted by the cluster.
Can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, or `tlsv1.3`.
The default is `tlsv1.2`.
+
This parameter can be set either globally or per service.
A value of `tlsv1.3` _cannot_ be applied either globally or to the Cluster Manager.

* `honorCipherOrder`.
Specifies whether the server uses its own cipher-suite preference, rather than the client's.
The cluster's list of accepted cipher-suites can be defined with the `cipherSuites` flag (see below).
The default value of `honorCipherOrder` is `true`: a setting of `false` is _not_ recommended, since insecure.
This parameter can be set either globally, or per service.

* `cipherSuites`.
Specifies a list of the cipher suites to be used, in order of preference.
The argument must be a list of cipher-suites.
+
This parameter can be set either globally, or per service.
If the parameter is set for a given service, each listed cipher-suite must appear as a member of the array that is the value of the non-configurable *supportedCipherSuites* setting for the service.
If the parameter is set globally, each listed cipher-suite can be used by a given service only if it appears as a member of *supportedCipherSuites* for that service.

For an explanation of the relationships between per service and global settings, see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc[On-the-Wire Security].

[#enforcing-tls]
=== Enforcing TLS

Before applying the `strict` value to the `clusterEncryptionLevel` parameter:

* Pause all Eventing functions on the cluster.
(Resume them only after changes to node-to-node encryption and encryption-level been applied.)
See xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-eventing-function-setup.adoc[eventing-function-setup].

* Ensure all client applications and scripts are able to connect with TLS.

* Ensure node-to-node encryption is enabled (see xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption]).

* Ensure all XDCR replications are configured as fully secure (see xref:manage:manage-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc[Enable Fully Secure Replications]).

Once `strict` has been applied to all nodes:

* Previously paused Eventing functions can be resumed.

* The Eventing Service debugger port (9140) is not available (since non-TLS only).
See xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Couchbase Server Ports].

* The node cannot be added to a Version 6.0.x cluster.
See xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online.adoc#tls-address-family-restriction-and-node-addition[TLS, Address-Family Restriction, and Node Addition].

[#responses]
== Responses

The `GET` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`, and returns an object containing each configured parameter, with its current value.
The `POST` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

For both methods, an incorrect URI gives `404 Object Not Found`, with a `Not found` error message.
Use of improper credentials gives `401 Unauthorized`.
An improper port number returns an error message such as `Failed to connect`, or `Port number out of range`.

For the `POST` method, incorrectly specified parameters fail with `404 Bad Request`, and return an `error` object that lists the errors in an array.
For example, a call that incorrectly specifies every significant parameter-value returns an object such as the following:

----
{
  "errors": [
    "honorCipherOrder - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'.",
    "cipherSuites - Invalid format. Expecting a list of ciphers.",
    "tlsMinVersion - Supported TLS versions are tlsv1.3, tlsv1.2, tlsv1.1, tlsv1",
    "clusterEncryptionLevel - Cluster encryption level must be one of [\"control\",\"all\",\"strict\"]",,
    "disableUIOverHttps - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'.",
    "disableUIOverHttp - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'.",
    "disableWWWAuthenticate - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'."
  ]
}
----

Note additionally that an attempt to establish a value for `clusterEncryptionLevel` prior to the enablement of node-to-node encryption returns the following error-message: `clusterEncryptionLevel - Can't set cluster encryption level when cluster encryption is disabled.`
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption], for details on how to enable.

== Examples

The methods and the URI can be used as shown below.

[#establish-on-the-wire-settings-globally]
=== Establish On-the-Wire Settings, Globally

The following establishes a subset of on-the-wire settings globally:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security \
-d disableUIOverHttp=true \
-d clusterEncryptionLevel=control \
-d tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.1 \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"]'
----

The `disableUIOverHttp` flag is given a value of `true`, indicating that access to Couchbase Web Console will be disabled over http.
The `disableUIOverHttps` flag is _not_ specified, meaning that access to Couchbase Web Console will _not_ be disabled over https, by default.
The `clusterEncryptionLevel` is specified as `control`, indicating that only server-management information is passed in encrypted form between cluster-nodes: note that this parameter can only be set after the `node-to-node-encryption` CLI command has been used to enable internal network-security for the cluster, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Manage Node-to-Node Encryption].
The `tlsMinVersion` is specified as version 1.1.
The `honorCipherOrder` parameter is _not_ specified, meaning that it retains its default value of `true`; which ensures that the cluster's own cipher-suites preference is used, rather than the client's.
The `cipherSuites` parameter is assigned a value that is a list of two cipher suites.

If successful, the call returns an empty array:

----
[]
----

[#retrieve-cluster-wide-settings]
=== Retrieve Cluster-Wide Settings

The `GET /settings/security` method and URI retrieve cluster-wide settings for on-the-wire security, as shown below.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] program, to enhance readability:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -GET \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security | jq '.'
----

If the call is successful, and some explicit settings have been made by the administrator, the output might appear as follows:

----
{
  "disableUIOverHttp": false,
  "disableUIOverHttps": false,
  "disableWWWAuthenticate": false,
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1",
  "cipherSuites": [
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"
  ],
  "honorCipherOrder": true,
  "data": {
    "cipherSuites": [
      "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
      "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
      "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
    ],
    "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1.2",
    "honorCipherOrder": true,
    "supportedCipherSuites": [
      "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
      "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
      "TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256",
      "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
              .
              .
              .
----

The global values of `disableUIOverHttp`, `disableUIOverHttps`, `tlsMinVersion`, and `honorCipherOrder` are thus displayed.
Note also that a global value for `cipherSuites` has also been established.

The return object contains, in addition to global settings, a subdocument for each service.
The truncated output shown here features values from the subdocument for the Data Service; which is shown to have its own values established for `cipherSuites`, `tlsMinVersion`, and `honorCipherOrder`.
The read-only value for `supportedCipherSuites` for the service is also displayed.

[#establish-per-service-settings]
=== Establish Per Service On-the-Wire Settings

The following call establishes global settings for `tlsMinVersion` and `supportedCipherSuites`, for the Data Service only:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security/data \
-d tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.1 \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA","TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA","TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"]'
----

Note that the `data` path-parameter has been added to the URI, as the value of `service-name`, in order to specify the Data Service.
If the call is successful, an empty array is returned.

To verify the new settings for the Data Service, use the `GET` method, again adding `data` to the URI:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X GET \
http://10.144.210.101:8091/settings/security/data | jq '.'
----

The returned output shows that the new settings have been successfully established:

----
{
  "cipherSuites": [
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
  ],
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1.1",
  "honorCipherOrder": true,
  "supportedCipherSuites": [
    "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
    "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",
              .
              .
              .
----
