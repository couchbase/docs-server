== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /settings/security

POST /settings/security
----

== Description

Allows settings to be established for the use of encryption.
This includes the encryption _level_, for node-to-node encryption within the cluster;
UI disablement over insecure connections; TLS minimum version; and a list of server-accepted cipher suites.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<host>:<port>/settings/security

curl -X POST -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<host>:<port>/settings/security
  -d disableUIOverHttp=<true|false>
  -d disableUIOverHttps=<true|false>
  -d clusterEncryptionLevel=<all|control>
  -d tlsMinVersion=<tlsv1|tlsv1.1|tslv1.2>
  -d honorCipherOrder=<true|false>
  -d cipherSuites=<list-of-accepted-cipher-suites>
----

The syntax for the `POST` method includes the following:

* `disableUIOverHttp`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over http.
Default is `false`, meaning that the console can be accessed over http.

* `disableUIOverHttps`.
Whether access to Couchbase Web Console should be disabled over https.
Default is `false`, meaning that the console can be accessed over https.

* `clusterEncryptionLevel`.
Controls the level of encryption imposed on inter-node communications within the cluster.
Can be either `control` (meaning that only server-management information is passed in encrypted form) or `all` (meaning that all information, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form).
This can only be set after cluster encryption has been enabled: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Apply Node-to-Node Encryption].

* `tlsMinVersion`.
Specifies the minimum TLS version accepted by the cluster.
Can be `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, or `tlsv1.2`.
The default is `tlsv1`.

* `honorCipherOrder`.
Specifies whether the cluster uses its own cipher-suite preference, rather than the client's.
The cluster's list of accepted cipher-suites can be defined with the `cipherSuites` flag (see below).
The default value of `honorCipherOrder` is `true`: a setting of `false` is _not_ recommended, since insecure.

* `cipherSuites`.
Specifies a list of the cipher suites to be used by the cluster, in order of preference.
The argument must be a list of cipher suites, each of which is supported by the underlying operating system.
If the value for `cipherSuites` is an empty list (`[]`), this specifies that the Couchbase Server default cipher-suite list is to be used.
Use `openssl ciphers -v` at the Linux command-line, to display the default list of cipher-suites available from the operating system.

[#responses]
== Responses

The `GET` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`, and returns an object containing each configured parameter, with its current value.
The `POST` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

For both methods, an incorrect URI gives `404 Object Not Found`, with a `Not found` error message.
Use of improper credentials gives `401 Unauthorized`.
An improper port number returns an error message such as `Failed to connect`, or `Port number out of range`.

For the `POST` method, incorrectly specified parameters fail with `404 Bad Request`, and return an `error` object that lists the errors in an array.
For example, a call that incorrectly specifies every significant parameter-value returns an object such as the following:

----
{
  "errors": [
    "honorCipherOrder - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'.",
    "cipherSuites - Invalid cipher suite names = TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA33",
    "tlsMinVersion - Supported TLS versions are ['tlsv1.2','tlsv1.1',tlsv1]",
    "clusterEncryptionLevel - Cluster encryption level must be one of ['control', 'all'].",
    "disableUIOverHttps - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'.",
    "disableUIOverHttp - Accepted values are 'true' and 'false'."
  ]
}
----

Note additionally that an attempt to establish a value for `clusterEncryptionLevel` prior to the enablement of node-to-node encryption returns the following error-message: `clusterEncryptionLevel - Can't set cluster encryption level when cluster encryption is disabled.`
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Apply Node-to-Node Encryption], for details on how to enable.

== Examples

The methods and the URI can be used as shown below.

[#establish-encryption-settings]
=== Establish Encryption Settings

The following establishes encryption settings for the cluster:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/security \
-d disableUIOverHttp=true \
-d clusterEncryptionLevel=control \
-d tlsMinVersion=tlsv1.1 \
-d 'cipherSuites=["TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA", "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"]'
----

The `disableUIOverHttp` flag is given a value of `true`, indicating that access to Couchbase Web Console will be disabled over http.
The `disableUIOverHttps` flag is _not_ specified, meaning that access to Couchbase Web Console will _not_ be disabled over https, by default.
The `clusterEncryptionLevel` is specified as `control`, indicating that only server-management information is passed in encrypted form between cluster-nodes: note that this parameter can only be set after the `node-to-node-encryption` CLI command has been used to enable internal network-security for the cluster, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/apply-node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Apply Node-to-Node Encryption].
The `tlsMinVersion` is specified as version 1.1.
The `honorCipherOrder` parameter is _not_ specified, meaning that it retains its default value of `true`; which ensures that the cluster's own cipher-suites preference is used, rather than the client's.
The `cipherSuites` parameter is assigned a value that is a list of two cipher suites.

If successful, the call returns an empty array:

----
[]
----

[#retrieve-encryption-settings]
=== Retrieve Encryption Settings

The `GET /settings/security` method and URI retrieve encryption settings for the cluster, as shown below.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] program, to enhance readability:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -GET \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/settings/security | jq '.'
----

If the call is successful, and occurs prior to any explicit settings by the administrator, the output is as follows:

----
{
  "disableUIOverHttp": false,
  "disableUIOverHttps": false,
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1",
  "cipherSuites": [],
  "honorCipherOrder": true
}
----

If explicit settings have been made &#8212; including the enablement of node-to-node encryption &#8212; the output might appear as follows:

----
{
  "disableUIOverHttp": false,
  "disableUIOverHttps": false,
  "tlsMinVersion": "tlsv1.1",
  "cipherSuites": [
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA",
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"
  ],
  "honorCipherOrder": true,
  "clusterEncryptionLevel": "control"
}
----

The returned object thus includes each of the settings &#8212; including `clusterEncryptionLevel` &#8212; with its current value.
An array containing the established list of server-acceptable cipher suites is provided as the value of `cipherSuites`.
