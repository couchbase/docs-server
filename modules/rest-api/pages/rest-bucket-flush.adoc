= Flushing Buckets
:description: pass:q[Flushing a bucket, which deletes all data stored within the bucket, can be performed with the REST API.]
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
{description}

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/buckets/default/controller/doFlush
----

== Description

_Flushing_ a bucket deletes all data currently stored in the bucket.
This operation can only be performed if the bucket has been configured with flushing _enabled_.
Enablement is performed either when the bucket is created, or subsequently, by editing.
For information, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

A bucket _cannot_ be flushed if it is currently the source for an outgoing XDCR replication.
For information on XDCR, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)].

Note that if the bucket contains a large number of documents, flushing causes a correspondingly high disk utilization.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST -u <username>:<password>
  <ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>/controller/doFlush
----

The `bucket-name` is the name of the bucket that is to be flushed.

If flushing is disabled for the specified bucket, `400 Bad Request` is returned, with the following error message: `{"_":"Flush is disabled for the bucket"}`.
If the URI is incorrectly specified, the operation fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.

If flushing is attempted on a bucket that is the source for an ongoing XDCR replication, the operation fails with `503 Service Unavailable`, and the following error message: `{"_":"Cannot flush buckets with outgoing XDCR"}`.

== Example

The following example flushes the bucket `beer-sample`.
The example assumes that flushing has already been enabled on the bucket.

----
curl -v -X POST \
http://10.144.220.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/beer-sample/controller/doFlush \
-u Administrator:password
