= Modify Index Batch Size
:description: The REST API supports modification of the batch size whereby the relocation and rebuilding of indexes, during rebalance, is maintained at a high level of performance.

[abstract]
{description}


== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /settings
----

== Description

Establishes the _batch size_, which is used for index rebuilding and metadata transfer, during rebalance.
Either the Full Admin or the Cluster Admin role is required.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:<port-number>/settings
  -u <username>:<password>
  -d '{"indexer.rebalance.transferBatchSize":<integer>}'
----

The port number must be either `9102` or `19102`, which are those of the `indexer_http_port` and `indexer_https_port` respectively.
The `integer` should be a small integer that corresponds to the batch size to be established.
The default is `3`.

The change automatically propagates to all Index-Service nodes, and will be remembered across node and cluster restarts.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.

Failure correctly to specify the key `"indexer.rebalance.transferBatchSize"` generates no error, and returns `200 OK`.

== Example

The following call establishes the batch size as `7`:

----
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:9102/settings -u Administrator:password \
-d '{"indexer.rebalance.transferBatchSize":7}'
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK` and no object.
