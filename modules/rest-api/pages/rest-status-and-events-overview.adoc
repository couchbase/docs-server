== APIs in this Section

Couchbase Server provides multiple ways of deriving cluster-status, by means of the REST API.
Additionally, _system events_, which provide the details of  significant occurrences on the cluster, can inspected -- through either _batch_ or _dynamic_ retrieval.
Each of the endpoints is listed in the following table.
