= Getting views information
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
To retrieve views information, access any server node in a cluster on port 8092.

== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_view/[view-name]
----

Where:

* bucket-name is the name of the bucket.
* ddoc-name is the name of the design document that contains the view.
* view-name is the name of the corresponding view within the design document.

Development view, the `ddoc-name` is prefixed with `dev_`.
For example, the design document `beer` is accessible as a development view using `dev_beer`.

Production views are accessible using their name only.

| `reduce`
| boolean
| Use the reduction function.

| `skip`

== Syntax

Curl request syntax:

----
GET http://[localhost]:8092/[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_view/[view-name]
----

To access a view stored within an SASL password-protected bucket, include the bucket name and bucket password within the URL of the request:

----
GET http://[bucket-name]:[password]@[localhost]: \
8092/[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_view/[view-name]
----

NOTE: Additional arguments to the URL request can be used to select information from the view, and provide limit, sorting and other options.

To output only ten items:

----
GET http://[localhost]:8092/[bucket-name]/_design/[ddoc-name]/_view/[view-name]?limit=10
----

IMPORTANT: The formatting of the URL follows the HTTP specification.
The first argument is separated from the base URL using a question mark ( `?` ).
Additional arguments are separated using an ampersand ( `&` ).
Special characters are quoted or escaped according to the HTTP standard rules.

== Example

Curl request example:

In the following example, an empty development view is created with a view name, johnView, and a design document name, _design/dev_john in the bucket, test2.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
  http://10.5.2.117:8092/test2/_design/dev_john/_view/johnView
----

== Response

View responses are JSON structures containing information about the number of rows in the view and the individual view information.

The following shows an empty View result from the previous example.

----
{
    "rows": [],
    "total_rows": 0
}
----

The following shows a populated View result:

----
{
  "total_rows": 576,
  "rows" : [
      {"value" : 13000, "id" : "James", "key" : ["James", "Paris"] },
      {"value" : 20000, "id" : "James", "key" : ["James", "Tokyo"] },
      {"value" : 5000,  "id" : "James", "key" : ["James", "Paris"] },
…
    ]
}
----

The JSON response returns the following fields:

* total_rows
+
A count of the number of rows of information within the stored View.
This shows the number of rows in the full View index, not the number of rows in the returned data set.

* rows
+
An array, with each element of the array containing the returned view data, consisting of the value, document ID that generated the row, and the key.

In the event of an error or incorrect parameters, the HTTP response is a JSON structure with a basic `error` field and a more detailed `reason` field.
For example:

----
{
  "error":"bad_request",
  "reason":"invalid UTF-8 JSON: {{error,{1,\"lexical error: \
  invalid char in json text.\\n\"}},\n\"Paris\"}"
}
----

NOTE: With client libraries, error response behavior might differ between client SDKs, but in all cases, an invalid query triggers an error or exception.
