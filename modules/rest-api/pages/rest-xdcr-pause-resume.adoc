= Pausing and Resuming a Replication

== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /settings/replications/<settingsURI>
----

== Description

An XDCR replication is paused and resumed by configuring `pauseRequested`; which is one of the _XDCR Advanced Settings_ described in xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-adv-settings.adoc[Managing Advanced Settings].

The replication that is to be paused or resumed is specified by means of its `settingsURI`, which can be returned by using the `GET /pools/default/tasks` method and URI, described in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

The Full Admin, Cluster Admin, or XDCR Admin role is required.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://[ localhost ]:8091/settings/replications/<settingsURI>
  -u <username>:<password>
  -d pauseRequested=[ true | false ]
----

The value of the `pauseRequested` flag can be `true`, which means that the specified replication should be paused; or `false`, which means that the specified replication should _not_ be paused.
The default value is `false`.
If the established value is `false` and a value of `true` is then specified, an ongoing replication is paused.
If the established value is `true` and a value of `false` is then specified, a paused replication is resumed.

The operation is idempotent: specifying `true` when the established value is already `true`, or specifying `false` when the value is already `false`, has no effect.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK` and an object containing all current advanced settings.

If the boolean is incorrectly specified, `400 Bad Request` is returned, with the following object: `{"pauseRequested": "The value must be a boolean"  }`.
If authentication is either not attempted or succeeds with inappropriate credentials, `403 Forbidden` is returned, with the following error message: `{"message": "Forbidden. User needs one of the following permissions", "permissions": ["cluster.bucket[travel-sample].xdcr!execute"]}`.
If authentication is attempted but specified credentials are not matched, `401 Unauthorized` is returned.

If the `settingsURI` is incorrectly specified, `500 Internal Server Error` is returned, with the message `requested resource not found`.
Incorrect specification of the URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.


== Examples

The following example pauses the replication from source bucket `travel-sample` to the target bucket `ts`.
Output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] command, to facilitate readability.

----
curl -v -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/settings/replications/2b5dcd1b0101a9d52f31a802d8c4231e%2Ftravel-sample%2Fts \
-u Administrator:password \
-d pauseRequested=true | jq '.'
----

If execution is successful, the replication is paused, and the following object, containing all current advanced settings, is returned:

}
----

As the output indicates from the displayed value of `pauseRequested`, the replication has been paused.

The following example restarts the replication

----
curl -v -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/settings/replications/2b5dcd1b0101a9d52f31a802d8c4231e%2Ftravel-sample%2Fts \
-u Administrator:password \
-d pauseRequested=false | jq '.'
----

If execution is successful, the replication is restarted, and the following output is returned:

----

  "checkpointInterval": 600,
  "ckptSvcCacheEnabled": true,
  "colMappingRules": {},
  "collectionsExplicitMapping": false,
