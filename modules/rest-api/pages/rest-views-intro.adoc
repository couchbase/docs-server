= Views API

[abstract]
The Views REST API is used to index and query JSON documents.

== Description

Views are functions written in JavaScript that can serve several purposes in your application.
You can use them to: find all the documents in your database, create a copy of data in a document and present it in a specific order, create an index to efficiently find documents by a particular value or by a particular structure in the document, represent relationships between documents, and perform calculations on data contained in documents.

NOTE: View functions are stored in a design document as JSON.
You can use the REST API to manage your design documents.
