== Http Methods and URIs

----
POST /node/controller/reloadCertificate

GET /pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>
----

[#description]
== Description

The `POST` method and `/node/controller/reloadCertificate` URI allow an administrator-configured node-certificate to be _loaded_ and _reloaded_ onto its intended node.
Prior to loading, the node-certificate must have been placed in an appropriately created `inbox` directory: see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates], for information.
If the node-certificate to be loaded is associated with an encrypted private key, a procedure can be defined for Couchbase Server's automatic access to and use of the passphrase for the key, when required.

The `GET` method and `/pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>` URI allow an administrator-configured node-certificate to be retrieved.
Note that such retrieval can only be performed with an administrator-configured node-certificate: it cannot be performed with the default node-certificate that is automatically generated for a node by Couchbase Server on initial configuration.

Note that the `POST` API _can_ be used on clusters one or more of whose nodes is running a version of Couchbase Server prior to 7.1.
The `GET` API can likewise be used: however, node-certificates for pre-7.1 nodes are not returned.

Both calls require either the Full Admin or the Local User Security Admin role.
For the loading of the node-certificate to succeed, the private key and chain file must both be readable by user `couchbase`.

[#node-certificate-validation]
=== Node-Certificate Validation

In Couchbase Enterprise Server Version 7.2+, the node-name _must_ be correctly identified in the node-certificate as a Subject Alternative Name.
If such identification is not correctly configured, failure may occur when uploading the certificate.
For information, see xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc#node-certificate-validation[Node-Certificate Validation].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax for these calls is as follows:

----
curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate
 -u <username>:<password>
 -d <json-passphrase-registration>

curl -X GET http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>
  -u <username>:<password>
----

=== JSON Passphrase Registration

If a node-certificate to be loaded is associated with an encrypted private key, a procedure can be defined to allow Couchbase Server to access and use the key's passphrase, when use of the key is required: the passphrase can be _registered_, by means of a JSON object, specified as the `json-passphrase-registration` argument.

Note that if the node-certificate has already been loaded, in order to register the passphrase for its key, the certificate can be _reloaded_, with the `json-passphrase-registration` specified: for this to be successful, the corresponding `pem` and `key` files must both still be within the created `inbox`, or must be recopied into it.

The following examples show how to register a passphrase in association with an encrypted private key.

==== Script

A JSON object of the following kind can be used to register a passphrase of type `script`:

----
{"privateKeyPassphrase": {"type": "script",
                          "path": "<path to script>",
                          "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
                          "trim": false,
                          "timeout": 5000}}
----

The specified `type` is `script`.
The value of `path`, which is a _required_ argument, should be the path to the script on the current node: for security reasons, this must be in the `couchbase/scripts` directory.
The value of `args`, which an _optional_ argument, should be an array containing one or more strings to be passed as arguments to the script: by default, the array is empty.
The value of `trim`, which is an _optional_ argument, can be either `true` or `false`, and determines whether redundant characters are to be removed from the script: by default, the value is `true`.
The value of `timeout`, which is an _optional_ argument, specifies the number of milliseconds that must elapse before the script is timed out: by default, the value is 5000.

The endpoint verifies that the script is present on the node, and is located in the `couchbase/scripts` directory.
(For example, on Linux, in `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/scripts`.)
When the private key is accessed, Couchbase Server executes the script, and treats the output as the passphrase for the private key.
The script must return status `0` &#8212; any other returned value is considered an error.

==== REST Endpoint

A JSON object of the following kind registers a passphrase of type `rest`:

----
{"privateKeyPassphrase": {"type": "rest",
                          "url": "<url to call>",
                          "addressFamily": inet6,
                          "httpsOpts": {"verifyPeer": true}
                          "headers": {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
                          "timeout": 5000}}
----

The specified `type` is `rest`.
The value of `url`, which is a _required_ argument, must be the endpoint to be called with `GET`: the endpoint can use either `http` or `https`.
The `addressFamily`, which is an _optional_ argument, specifies the address family to be used, and can be either `inet` (meaning IPv4) or `inet6` (meaning IPv6): the default value is `inet`.
The value of `httpsOpts`, which is an _optional_ argument that is valid only when `https` is used in the value specified for `url`, must be a JSON key-value pair: the key must be `verifyPeer`; the value can be either `true` or `false` &#8212; a value of `true` (which is the default value) determines that peer verification _is_ performed when Https is used.
The value of `headers`, which is an _optional_ argument, should be an object containing one or more administrator-defined key-value pairs &#8212; each value specifying a header that is to be used in the communication: by default, no headers are passed.
The value of `timeout`, which is an _optional_ argument, specifies the number of milliseconds that must elapse before the call is timed out: the default value is 5000.

When the private key is accessed, Couchbase Server attempts to extract the password by means of the specified endpoint, using the `GET` method.
If `200` is returned, the returned text is treated as the passphrase for the private key.
If anything else is returned, this is considered an error.

==== Plain

A JSON object of the following kind can be used to register a passphrase of type `plain`:

----
{"privateKeyPassphrase": {"type": "plain",
                          "password": "124!*oU"}}
----

The specified `type` is `plain`.
The value of `password` is the passphrase established for the private key.

The specified passphrase is stored on the node with the Couchbase-Server procedures for managing system secrets.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-system-secrets.adoc[Manage System Secrets].
When the private key is accessed, the passphrase is transmitted in the clear (unless Https is used), and can be transmitted between nodes: this is insecure, and consequently, the `plain` option is recommended only for pre-production use.

[#responses]
== Responses

For both the `POST` and the `GET`, success returns `200 OK`.
The `GET` also returns an object whose fields specify the details of the certificate.
For both, a malformed URI fails, with `404 Object Not Found`; failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`; and insufficient privileges gives `403 Forbidden`, with a notification such as `"Forbidden. User needs one of the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.admin.security!read"]`.
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.

If the `POST` is called with either no node certificate or no node-private key in the `inbox` directory, the call fails with `400 Bad Request`, and either the notification `"Unable to read private key file /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/pkey.key. The file does not exist."`; or the notification `"Unable to read certificate chain file /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/chain.pem. The file does not exist."`.

If the `POST` is called with either the private key for the node-certificate or the chain file not readable by user `couchbase`, the call fails with an error message such as the following: `"Unable to read private key file /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/pkey.key. Missing permission for reading the file, or for searching one of the parent directories."`
In such a case, the private key and chain file should both be made readable by user `couchbase`.

If the `GET` method is used with no administrator-configured node-certificate having been uploaded, the call returns the default, system-generated certificate.

If the node-certificate does not correctly specify the node-name as a Subject Alternative Name, one of the following occurs:

* A warning is flagged, and the operation succeeds.
The warning takes the following form: `{"warnings":[{"name":"cert_san_invalid","message":"Address specified in cert SAN part can't be verified.","severity":2,"severityName":"minimal"}]}`.

* An error is flagged, and the operation fails.
The error takes the following form: `Unable to validate certificate on host: 127.0.0.1. Please make sure the certificate on this host contains host name '127.0.0.1' in Subject Alternative Name. Refer to Couchbase docs for more info on how to create node certificates`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following call uploads an appropriately configured node certificate from the node's `inbox` directory:

----
curl -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`.

The following call retrieves the node certificate that is currently uploaded:

----
curl -v -X GET http://10.143.201.101:8091/pools/default/certificate/node/10.143.201.101:8091 \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and an object whose fields specify warnings, the Subject Common Name, the expiry date, the type (whether _generated_ by Couchbase Server, or _uploaded_ by the administrator), the pem-encoded contents of the node certificate, and, when the plain password-type has been used for an encrypted private key, the passphrase for the private key (securely displayed as asterisks):

----
{
  "warnings": [],
  "subject": "CN=Couchbase Server",
  "expires": "2022-11-24T10:59:14.000Z",
  "type": "uploaded",
  "pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            .
            .
            .
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n",
  "privateKeyPassphrase": {}
}

----
