= Upload and Retrieve a Node Certificate
:page-topic-type: reference
:page-aliases: rest-api:rest-encryption

[abstract]
The REST API can be used to upload and retrieve an uploaded node certificate.

[#http-method-and-uri]
== Http Methods and URIs

----
POST /node/controller/reloadCertificate

GET /pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091
----

[#description]
== Description

The `POST` method and `/node/controller/reloadCertificate` URI allow an administrator-configured node certificate to be _loaded_ and _reloaded_ onto its intended node.
Prior to loading, the node certificate must have been placed in an appropriately created `inbox` directory: see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-server-certificates.adoc[Configure Server Certificates], for information.

The `GET` method and `/pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091` URI allow an administrator-configured node certificate to be retrieved.
Note that such retrieval can only be performed with an administrator-configured node certificate: it cannot be performed with the default node certificate that is automatically provided to a node by Couchbase Server on initial configuration.

Both calls require either the Full Admin or the Security Admin role.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax for these calls is as follows:

----
curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate
 -u <username>:<password>

curl -X GET http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/certificate/node/<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091
  -u <username>:<password>
----

The copy of the node certificate returned by the `GET` method should be saved appropriately: for example, by means of `> <node-certificate-copy>`, on the local filesystem.

[#responses]
== Responses

For both the `POST` and the `GET`, success returns `200 OK`.
The `GET` also returns an object whose fields specify the Subject Common Name, expiry date, and pem-encoded contents of the node certificate.
For both, a malformed URI fails, with `404 Object Not Found`; failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`; and insufficient privileges gives `403 Forbidden`, with a notification such as `"Forbidden. User needs one of the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.admin.security!read"]`.
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.

If the `POST` is called with either no node certificate or no node-private key in the `inbox` directory, the call fails with `400 Bad Request`, and either the notification `"Unable to read private key file /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/pkey.key. The file does not exist."`; or the notification `"Unable to read certificate chain file /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/chain.pem. The file does not exist."`.

If the `GET` method is used with no administrator-configured node certificate having been uploaded, the call fails with `404 Object Not Found`, and the notification `Certificate is not set up on this node`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following call uploads an appropriately configured node certificate from the node's `inbox` directory:

----
curl -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`.

The following call retrieves the node certificate that is currently uploaded:

----
curl -v -X GET http://10.143.201.101:8091/pools/default/certificate/node/10.143.201.101:8091 \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and an object whose fields specify the Subject Common Name, expiry date, and pem-encoded contents of the node certificate:

----
{
  "subject":"CN=Couchbase Server",
  "expires":"2021-08-24T03:16:32.000Z",
  "pem":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
                .
                .
                .
         -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n\n"
}
----
