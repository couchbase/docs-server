[#rest-listing-node-services-description]
== Description

Couchbase services (Data, Query, Index, Search, Analytics, and Eventing) and other essential processes are associated with specific port numbers.
A complete list of the associations is provided in xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements].

The services and processes currently occupying these port numbers on a given node are listed by means of the `GET /pools/default/nodeServices` method and URI.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X GET -u [admin]:[password]
http://[ip-address]:8091/pools/default/nodeServices
----

[#responses]
== Responses

Success gives the status `200 OK`, and returns an object containing a list that includes all services and their port numbers, plus any alternate addresses and port numbers that may have been configured.

If an incorrect primary address is specified, a `Could not resolve host: <host-number>` error message is displayed.

If the URI is incorrectly specified, a `404 Object Not Found` error is flagged.

[#example]
== Example

The following example pipes the returned object to the `jq` command, to facilitate readability:

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/nodeServices | jq
----

The displayed output is as follows:
