== Description

The Search Service automatically partitions its indexes across all Search nodes in the cluster, ensuring optimal distribution, following rebalance.
To achieve this, in all versions prior to 7.0.2, partitions needing to be newly created are entirely _built_, on their newly assigned nodes.

In 7.0.2, and in later versions of Couchbase Server prior to 7.1, this remains the default way of creating new partitions during rebalance.
However, partition-creation by _file transfer_ is also provided, as a significant performance enhancement.
This option allows files to be _transferred_ from old nodes to new; so that overheads associated with _partition build_ are avoided.

File transfer is enabled and disabled by the `PUT /api/managerOptions` method and URI.
Note that this API is provided only for Couchbase Server 7.0.2 and later.

This feature is Enterprise-only, and requires all Search-Service nodes to be running 7.0.2+.

During file transfer, should an unresolvable error occur, file transfer is automatically abandoned, and partition build is used instead.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X PUT http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8094/api/managerOptions
  -u <username>:<password>
  -H "Content-type:application/json"
  -d '{"disableFileTransferRebalance": [ "true" | "false" ]}'
----

If, in 7.0.2+, the value specified for the key `disableFileTransferRebalance` is `false` (the default being `true`), new Search-Service partitions are created during rebalance by means of partition-file transfer.
When the value is `true`, partitions are created by means of partition build, from scratch; over DCP connections from the Data Service.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`, and the message `{"status":"ok"}`.
If the  URI is incorrectly specified, `404 Object Not Found` is returned.
If the method is incorrectly specified, `405 Method Not Allowed` is returned, with the message `{"error":"Method not allowed for endpoint","status":"fail"}`.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.

== Examples

The following example _enables_ the creation of new partitions by means of file-transfer:

----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8094/api/managerOptions \
-u Administrator:password \
-H "Content-type:application/json" \
-d '{"disableFileTransferRebalance": "false" }'
----

From this point, Search-Service index-partitions are created by _file transfer_, on the new nodes assigned to them during rebalance.

The following example _disables_ the creation of new partitions by means of file-transfer:

----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8094/api/managerOptions \
-u Administrator:password \
-H "Content-type:application/json" \
-d '{"disableFileTransferRebalance": "true" }'
----

From this point, Search-Service index-partitions are again _built_ on the new nodes assigned to them during rebalance.

In each case, successful execution returns the following:

----
{"status":"ok"}
----
