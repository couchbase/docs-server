== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/rebalance
----

[#rest-cluster-rebalance-description]
== Description

Clusters can be _rebalanced_.
When one or more nodes have been brought into a cluster, or have been taken out of a cluster, _rebalance_ redistributes data and indexes among the available nodes.
The _cluster map_ is correspondingly updated and distributed to clients.
The process occurs while the cluster continues to service requests for data.

A conceptual overview of nodes, and how they are combined into clusters, is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc[Nodes].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/controller/rebalance
  [-d knownNodes | -d ejectedNodes]
----

The parameters are:

* `knownNodes`.
Must always be specified.
The value is a list containing all nodes that are in the cluster at the start of the rebalance process.

* `ejectedNodes`.
Specified when one or more nodes are to be ejected from the cluster by the rebalance process.
The value is a list containing all nodes to be ejected.
+
The node-list specified by `ejectedNodes` is thus a subset of that specified by `knownNodes`.

For information on rebalance, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc[Rebalance].

[#responses]
== Responses

Success gives the status `200 OK`, with no object returned.

If either parameter specifies an unknown node, or if a node currently in the cluster is omitted from the value of `knownNodes`, the status `400 Bad Request` is given, and the following object is returned:

----
{"mismatch":1}
----

If `knownNodes` is _not_ specified and `ejectedNodes` _is_ specified, the status `400 Bad Request` is given, and the following object is returned:

----
{"empty_known_nodes":1}
----

[#examples]
== Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to determine which nodes are currently in the cluster; how to rebalance after a hard failover; how to rebalance in order to eject a node from the cluster; and how to re-add an ejected node to a cluster.

For information on how to retrieve status on an ongoing rebalance, see xref:rest-api:rest-get-rebalance-progress.adoc[Getting Rebalance Progress] and xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

[#return-cluster-nodes]
=== Return Cluster Nodes

To determine which nodes are currently in the cluster, use the `GET /pools/default` HTTP method and URI.
In this example, the (extensive) output is piped to the `jq` tool to be formatted, and the lines featuring the `hostname` are then filtered by `grep`, to ensure readability.

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output contains the following lines, which specify all nodes currently in the cluster:

----
"hostname": "10.143.190.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.102:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.103:8091",
----

For more information on this method and URI, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-details.adoc[Viewing Cluster Details].

[#perform-rebalance-following-a-hard-failover]
=== Perform Rebalance Following a Hard Failover

The _hard failover_ of a node results in that node continuing to be a member of the cluster, but being unable to serve data.
Since its active vBuckets are unavailable, corresponding replica vBuckets are promoted to active status on the still-available nodes.
This means that data continues to be served, but is in an _imbalanced state_ across the cluster.
This requires rebalance.

For detailed conceptual information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc[Hard Failover].
For information on performing a hard failover, see xref:rest-api:rest-node-failover.adoc[Failing over Nodes].

To perform the rebalance, specify all cluster-nodes in the value for the `knownNodes` parameter, including the one or ones to which hard failover is known to have been applied:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.143.190.101%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.102%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.103'
----

On success, the status `200 OK` is given, and no object is returned.
The failed-over node has been removed, and the data is now distributed evenly across the surviving nodes.
The successful node-removal is confirmed by again examining the current cluster nodes:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output indicates which nodes are still in the cluster:

----
"hostname": "10.143.190.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.102:8091",
----

This confirms that `10.143.190.103` has been removed.

[#add-a-node-to-a-cluster-then-rebalance]
=== Add a Node to a Cluster, then Rebalance

Adding a node to a cluster is a two-step process.

. The `POST /controller/addNode` HTTP method and URI are used to add the node.
This allows service-deployment for the node to be specified.
A placeholder username and password can be specified, when adding an unprovisioned node.

. The `POST /controller/rebalance` HTTP method and URI are used to rebalance the added node into the cluster.
Include the new node in the `knownNodes` node-list.

For example, the following command adds node `10.143.1990.103` to the cluster from which it was removed, and assigns it the Data Service:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
10.142.181.101:8091/controller/addNode \
-d 'hostname=10.143.190.103&user=someName&password=somePassword&services=kv'
----

If successful, this returns the following object, indicating that the node is now recognized as a member of the cluster:

----
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.143.190.103"}
----

For more information on this method and URI, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-addnodes.adoc[Adding Nodes to Clusters].

Next, the added node is rebalanced into the cluster.
This allows it to take its share of the data-distribution.

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.143.190.101%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.102%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.103'
----

On success, the response code `200 OK` is given, and no object is returned.
The cluster is now rebalanced.
At the conclusion, the cluster can again be checked for its current membership:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output now includes the following:

----
"hostname": "10.143.190.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.102:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.103:8091",
----

This confirms that `10.143.190.103` has been rebalanced into the cluster.

[#eject-a-node]
=== Eject a Node

To eject a node, use the `POST /controller/rebalance` HTTP method and URI.
Specify the entire current node-list for the cluster as the value of the `knownNodes` parameter.
Specify the list of nodes to be ejected as the value of the `ejectedNodes` parameter.

For example, the following command ejects node `10.143.190.103` from the cluster:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'ejectedNodes=ns_1%4010.143.190.103' \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.143.190.101%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.102%2Cns_1%4010.143.190.103'
----

On success, the response code `200 OK` is given, and no object is returned.
At the conclusion, the cluster can again be checked for its current membership:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default | jq '.' | grep hostname
----

The output now includes the following:

----
"hostname": "10.143.190.101:8091",
"hostname": "10.143.190.102:8091",
----

[#rest-cluster-rebalance-adjustduringcompaction]
== Adjusting Rebalance During Compaction

=== Description

If a rebalance is performed while a node is undergoing index compaction, rebalance delays may be experienced.
The parameter, `rebalanceMovesBeforeCompaction`, is used to improve rebalance performance: potentially, this results in a larger index.
This setting can be modified with the `POST /internalSettings` endpoint.
By default, it is 64.
This specifies that 64 vBuckets are to be moved per node; at which point all vBucket movement is paused, and index compaction is triggered.
Since index compaction is therefore not performed while vBuckets are being moved, a large `rebalanceMovesBeforeCompaction` value results in the server spending less time compacting indexes; potentially resulting in larger index files, which take up more disk space.

For example:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password 'http://10.5.2.54:8091/internalSettings' \
    -d 'rebalanceMovesBeforeCompaction=256'
----
