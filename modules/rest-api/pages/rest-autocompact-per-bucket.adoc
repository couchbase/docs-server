= Auto-Compaction: Per Bucket
:description: Auto-compaction settings can be established and retrieved for individual buckets.

[abstract]
{description}

== Description

Auto-compaction settings can be modified for an existing bucket.
Once this has occurred, the bucket's auto-compaction settings will no longer be affected by changes to the global auto-compaction settings.

Auto-compaction settings for a specific bucket can be established and retrieved by the _Full Admin_ and _Cluster Admin_ roles.
Auto-compaction settings for a specific bucket can be retrieved by a _Bucket Admin_ role that applies to that bucket; and by the _Read-Only Admin_ role.

Auto-compaction settings for _GSI Indexes_ are provided; however, these are for use with Couchbase Server Community Edition only.
These settings are not needed for the indexes used by Enterprise Edition: if these settings are established, they are ignored by nodes running Enterprise Edition.
For more information, see xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/storage-settings.adoc[Storage Settings].

== HTTP methods and URIs

Per bucket auto-compaction settings are retrieved and established by the following combinations of HTTP method and URI:

----
GET /pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]

POST /pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]

The parameters, which can be specified by the `POST` method and (unless otherwise specified) retrieved by the `GET` method, are as follows:

[cols="20,20"]
|===
| Function | Description

| `autoCompactionDefined`
| Boolean specifying whether the auto-compaction settings for the specified bucket can be modified.
If `true`, the settings _can_ be modified; if `false`, they _cannot_ be modified.
Note that this parameter _must_ be specified as `true`, for per-bucket auto-compaction settings to be modified.
If the parameter is _not_ specified as `true`, the call completes without error &#8212; but no modifications occur, and no further errors are reported.
This parameter cannot be retrieved with the `GET` method.

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the database fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `databaseFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of database fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[percentage]`
| Integer specifying the view fragmentation percentage that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `viewFragmentationThreshold[size]`
| Integer specifying the megabytes of view fragmentation that is the point at which compaction is triggered.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute (within the specified starting hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute (within the specified concluding hour) of the time-period during which compaction can run.

| `allowedTimePeriod[abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

| `parallelDBAndViewCompaction`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that compaction of databases and views _should_ or _should not_ run in parallel.
This parameter _must_ be specified.

| `purgeInterval`
| The frequency with which the _tombstone purge_ is run, specified as either an integer or a decimal number.
If a decimal is specified, the fractional part is rounded at fifteen places.
The default value is 3.0; the minimum 0.04; the maximum 60.

| `indexCompactionMode`
| The compaction mode for indexes.
Can be either `standard` or `circular`.

| `indexCircularCompaction[daysOfWeek]`
| The days of the week on which circular compaction (if specified) is to run.
Individual values must be day-names, each specified with an initial capital, and otherwise lower-case: `Sunday`, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`.
Multiple values must be separated by a single comma, with no spaces.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the starting hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the starting minute of the time-period, within the specified starting hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toHour]`
| Integer between 0 and 23 inclusive, specifying the concluding hour of the time-period during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][toMinute]`
| Integer between 0 and 59 inclusive, specifying the concluding minute of the time-period, within the specified concluding hour, during which circular index compaction, if specified, can run.

| `indexCircularCompaction[interval][abortOutside]`
| Either `true` or `false`, indicating respectively that circular index compaction, if specified, _should_ or _should not_ be aborted, if its running extends beyond the specified time of conclusion.

[#responses]
== Responses

If the call is successful, `200 OK` is given.

A malformed URI gives `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

An attempt to establish per-bucket auto-compaction settings that does not include the `parallelDBAndViewCompaction` parameter fails with `400 Bad Request` and an object that includes the following key-value pair: `{"parallelDBAndViewCompaction":"parallelDBAndViewCompaction is missing"}`.

An attempt to establish per-bucket auto-compaction settings that does not include a `true` setting for the `autoCompactionDefined` parameter does _not_ fail, but does not establish _any_ modified settings, and does not report any further errors.

If, when auto-compaction settings are being established, one or more individual parameter-values are incorrectly specified, `400 Bad Request` is returned, and an object containing error messages is displayed.
For example, attempting to assign `allowedTimePeriod[toHour]` the value `24` returns `"allowedTimePeriod[toHour]":"to hour is too large. Allowed range is 0 - 23"`.

Index-fragmentation parameters, which apply only to Couchbase Server Community Edition, are ignored if established for a cluster consisting of Enterprise Edition-based nodes.

If one or more individual parameter-names are incorrectly specified:

* The call may nevertheless succeed, returning `200 OK`.
The values assigned to validly specified parameters will be applied.

* An invalid parameter-name and its assigned value may be ignored.
For example, specifying `-d purgeIntervalg=11` leaves the `purgeInterval` at its current value.

* An invalid parameter-specification may result in the value being established as `"undefined"`.
For example, specifying `-d allowedTimePeriod[toMinut3e]=10` results in a setting such as the following:

----
"allowedTimePeriod": {
      "fromHour": 7,
      "toHour": 12,
      "fromMinute": 7,
      "toMinute": "undefined",
      "abortOutside": true
    },
----

Failure to establish settings correctly is likely to generate errors; and may have further, unpredictable consequences.

== Examples

The following examples show how to retrieve and establish per-bucket auto-compaction settings.

=== Retrieving Per-Bucket Auto-Compaction Settings

The following command retrieves the per-bucket auto-compaction settings for the `travel-sample` bucket.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] command, to optimize readability.

----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password http://10.143.193.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample | jq
----

If successful, the command returns statistics on all aspects of the bucket.
The opening section of the output appears as follows:

    },
    "viewFragmentationThreshold": {
      "percentage": 30,
      "size": 1073741824
    }
  },
            .
            .
            .

=== Establishing Per-Bucket Auto-Compaction Settings

The following command establishes the per-bucket auto-compaction settings for the `travel-sample` bucket

----
curl -i -X POST http://10.143.193.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample \
-u Administrator:password \
-d autoCompactionDefined=true \
-d databaseFragmentationThreshold[percentage]=30 \
-d databaseFragmentationThreshold[size]=1073741824 \
-d viewFragmentationThreshold[percentage]=30 \
-d viewFragmentationThreshold[size]=1073741824 \
-d allowedTimePeriod[fromHour]=0 \
-d allowedTimePeriod[fromMinute]=0 \
-d allowedTimePeriod[toHour]=6 \
-d allowedTimePeriod[toMinute]=0 \
-d allowedTimePeriod[abortOutside]=true \
-d parallelDBAndViewCompaction=false \
-d purgeInterval=3.0 \
-d indexCompactionMode=circular \
-d indexCircularCompaction[daysOfWeek]=Monday,Wednesday,Friday \
-d indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromHour]=6 \
-d indexCircularCompaction[interval][fromMinute]=0 \
-d indexCircularCompaction[interval][toHour]=9 \
-d indexCircularCompaction[interval][toMinute]=0 \
-d indexCircularCompaction[interval][abortOutside]=true
----

This example establishes fragmentation thresholds and sizes for database and view, and specifies the time-period during which compaction should occur.
It specifies that compaction be aborted if it should overrun this time-period.
Parallel compaction for database and view is switched _off_.
The tombstone purge interval is set to 3 days; and _circular_ standard compaction is specified for particular days and hours.
