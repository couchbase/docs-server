== Description

Initializes a node, prior to its being provisioned as a one-node cluster.
This means to establish local paths for on-disk storage required by the Data, Index, Analytics, and Eventing Services; and to establish a local path for a JRE, to be used by the Analytics Service.
Once estabished, these paths continue to be used by the node subsequent to its provisioning with services, memory-allocations, administrator username and password, and other details.
Indeed, these paths will continue to be used by the node even subsequent to the node's addition to another cluster.

If one or more paths are not specified (or if initialization with this interface is left entirely unperformed), defaults are provided when provisioning occurs.

Prior to provisioning, initialization can be performed repeatedly, with new values established each time.
After provisioning, initialization can no longer be performed.


[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/nodes/self/controller/settings
  -u <username>:<password>
  -d data_path=<data-path>
  -d index_path=<index-path>
  -d cbas_path=<analytics-path>
  -d eventing_path=<eventing-path>
  -d java_home=<jre-path>
----

Specified directory paths must be writable by user `couchbase`.

== Responses

If a directory is not writable by user `couchbase`, `400 Bad Request` is returned, with a message such as: `["Could not set analytics storage. All directories must be writable by 'couchbase' user."].`
An incorrectly specified URL or data parameter returns `404 Object Not Found`.

An attempt to re-initialize after provisioning returns `400 Bad Request`, with a message such as: `["Changing paths of nodes that are part of provisioned cluster is not supported"]`.

== Example

The following example establishes the paths for the Data, Index, Analytics, and Eventing Services.

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
  http://10.142.181.103:8091/nodes/self/controller/settings \
  -d 'data_path=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fdata&' \
  -d 'index_path=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fidata&' \
  -d 'cbas_path=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fadata&' \
  -d 'eventing_path=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fedata&'
