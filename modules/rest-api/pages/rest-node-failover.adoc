= Failing over Nodes
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Nodes are failed over via hard failover via the `POST /controller/failOver` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP method and URI

Failing over a node indicates that the node is no longer available in a cluster and replicated data on another node should be made available to clients.
This endpoint along with the `otpNode` parameter (internal node name) fails over a specific node.
