== Description

When a node has become unresponsive, and active vBuckets have thereby become unavailable for the serving of data, hard failover should be used to take the unresponsive node out of the cluster.

During hard failover, the Cluster Manager promotes replica vBuckets to active status on the remaining cluster-nodes.
A revised cluster-map is then communicated to all clients.
When hard failover is complete, no further attempts are made to access vBuckets on the failed-over node, but the node has not yet been fully taken out of the cluster.
The cluster is at this point considered to be in a _degraded state_, in terms of availability; as it now contains a reduced number of replica vBuckets, and may lack resources for handling a further node-outage.
Rebalance should therefore be performed.

Hard failover should _not_ be used as part of regular, planned maintenance activities that can be conducted with all cluster-nodes available.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/failover.adoc[Failover].

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X POST -u <username>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-hostname>:<port>/controller/failOver
  -d [otpNode=node_1@<hostname>]
  -d allowUnsafe=< true | false >
----

The value of each specified `otpNode` parameter must be the name of a node that will be hard-failed over.

The value of `allowUnsafe` must be either `true` or `false` (which is the default); indicating whether or not hard failover should be attempted in _unsafe_ mode.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc#default-and-unsafe[Hard Failover in Default and Unsafe Modes].

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.

Incorrectly specifying the target cluster returns `Failed to connect`.
Incorrectly specifying the URI returns a `404 Object Not Found` error, and a `Requested resource not found` notification.

Specifying an unknown server to be failed over returns a `400 Bad Request` notification, and an error message such as the following: `Unknown server given: ["ns_1@10.143.201.106"]`.

Failure to authenticate returns a `401 Unauthorized` notification.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following curl statement performs a hard failover of node `10.142.180.102` from a cluster identified as `10.142.180.1`.

curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.1:8091/controller/failOver \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.180.102'
----

The following performs a hard failover of nodes `10.142.180.102` and `10.142.180.103` from a cluster identified as `10.142.180.1`.
Note that multi-node failover is always _hard_ failover.

curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.1:8091/controller/failOver \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.180.102' \
-d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.142.180.103'
----

The following performs an _unsafe_, hard failover of nodes `10.142.180.102` and `10.142.180.103` from a cluster identified as `10.142.180.1`.

[source,bourne]

curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.142.180.1:8091/controller/failOver \
-d otpNode=ns_1%4010.142.180.102\&otpNode=ns_1%4010.142.180.103 \
