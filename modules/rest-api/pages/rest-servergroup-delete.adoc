[#http-method-and-uri]
== HTTP method and URI

----
DELETE /pools/default/serverGroups/<:uuid>
----

This deletes a specified server group.
The server group must be empty, for the request to succeed.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X DELETE -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<host>:<port>/pools/default/serverGroups/<uuid>
----

As this indicates, the `uuid` of the group to be deleted must be appended to the URI.
The `uuid` can be determined by means of the procedure explained in xref:rest-api:rest-servergroup-get.adoc[Getting Server Group Information].

[#responses]
== Responses

Success gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty object.
An incorrectly specified `uuid` gives `404 Object Not Found`, and returns an empty object.
Specifying a name already assigned to an existing group gives `400 Bad Request`, and returns an object of the form `{"name": "already exists"}`.
Attempting to delete a non-empty group gives `400 Bad Request`, and returns an object of the form `{"_":"group is not empty"}`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example assumes that the procedure described in xref:rest-api:rest-servergroup-get.adoc[Getting Server Group Information] has provided output containing the following:

----
{
  "name": "Group 2",
  "uri": "/pools/default/serverGroups/dfbed23035cc57eac0f4e72ce0c8667a",
  "addNodeURI": "/pools/default/serverGroups/dfbed23035cc57eac0f4e72ce0c8667a/addNode",
  "nodes": []
}
----

This indicates that the cluster contains a group named `Group 2`, whose `uuid` is `dfbed23035cc57eac0f4e72ce0c8667a`.
The value of `node` is an empty array, indicating that there are no nodes assigned to the group: therefore, the group may be deleted.

Therefore, the following request deletes `Group 2`, by specifying `dfbed23035cc57eac0f4e72ce0c8667a`:

----
curl -X DELETE -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/serverGroups/\
dfbed23035cc57eac0f4e72ce0c8667a
----
