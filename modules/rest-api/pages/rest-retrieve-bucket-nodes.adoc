[#http-method-and-uri]
== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>/nodes
----

[#description]
== Description

This lists all nodes that are members of a specified cluster on which a specified bucket resides.
The information includes, for each node, the URI of the node itself, plus the URI for statistics corresponding to the specified bucket.
Information on all the cluster's nodes, including nodes that do not host the Data Service, is included in the returned object.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u <administrator>:<password>
   http://<host>:<port>/pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>/nodes
----

The `<bucket-name>` must be the name of a bucket defined on the cluster.

[#responses]
== Responses

If successful, `200 OK` is given, and an object containing node-related information for the specified bucket is returned.

A malformed URI gives `400 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
Specifying a non-existent bucket produces a `404 Object Not Found` error, and a `Requested resource not found` message.

[#returned-object contents]
=== Returned-Object Contents

The returned object contains a `servers` array, each of whose members is an object containing the `hostname` and `uri` of a node, plus the `uri` for obtaining bucket-related `stats` on the node.

[#example]
== Example

The following example lists nodes the on the cluster `10.143.192.101`, which contains the bucket `travel-sample`.

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes | jq
----

Note that the call is piped to the `jq` tool, to enhance the readability of the output.

There are three nodes on the cluster, which are `10.143.109.101` and `10.143.192.102`, which both host the Data Service; and `10.143.192.103`, which does _not_ host the Data Service.
The response is as follows:

----
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "hostname": "10.143.192.101:8091",
      "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.101%3A8091",
      "stats": {
        "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.101%3A8091/stats"
      }
    },
    {
      "hostname": "10.143.192.102:8091",
      "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.102%3A8091",
      "stats": {
        "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.102%3A8091/stats"
      }
    },
    {
      "hostname": "10.143.192.103:8091",
      "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.103%3A8091",
      "stats": {
        "uri": "/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/nodes/10.143.192.103%3A8091/stats"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

The `uri` for `stats`, provided for each node, can be used to retrieve bucket-statistics for the node.
In this case, if used in such a query, the `uri` for `10.143.192.103` returns an object that indicates the specified bucket is not present.
