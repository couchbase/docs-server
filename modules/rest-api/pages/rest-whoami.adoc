[abstract]
A Couchbase-Server user can check their id (or _username_), domain, roles, and other details.

== HTTP method and URI

----
GET ./whoami
----

== Description

The call returns an object that contains the following:

* `roles`.
An object containing a key-value pair for every role assigned to the user.
For example, `"role": "analytics_reader"`.
Bucket-related roles are accompanied by a statement of the bucket to which the role applies.
For example, `"bucket_name": "travel-sample"`.

* `id`.
The user's id (or _username_).

* `domain`.
The user's _authentication domain_, which can be `local` or `external`.
For information, see xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc[Authentication Domains].

* `name`.
The user's full name, if specified.

* `password_change_date`.
The date on which the user's password was last changed.
For example, `"2020-02-13T04:08:31.000Z"`.

== Responses

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and an object that contains information on the user's id, domain, name, roles, and date of last password-change.

A malformed URI returns `404 Object Not Found`. Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.

== Example

The following call returns information on a user whose id is `multiRoleAdmin`.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] command, to facilitate output-readability.

----
curl -X GET -u multiRoleAdmin:multiRoleAdminPassword \
http://10.143.194.101:8091/whoami | jq
----

If successful, the command returns output such as the following:

----
{
  "roles": [
    {
      "role": "analytics_reader"
    },
    {
      "role": "replication_admin"
    },
    {
      "role": "security_admin"
    },
    {
      "role": "bucket_full_access",
      "bucket_name": "travel-sample"
    },
    {
      "role": "query_manage_index",
      "bucket_name": "*"
    },
    {
      "role": "views_reader",
      "bucket_name": "*"
    }
  ],
  "id": "multiRoleAdmin",
  "domain": "local",
  "name": "John Smith",
  "password_change_date": "2020-02-13T04:08:31.000Z"
}
