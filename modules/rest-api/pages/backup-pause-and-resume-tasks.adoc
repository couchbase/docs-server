[#http-methods-and-uris]
== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /cluster/self/repository/active/<repository-id>/pause

POST /cluster/self/repository/active/<repository-id>/resume
----

[#description]
== Description

The `repository-id` must be the name of an active repository on the cluster.
The respective URIs pause and resume the running of all tasks for the repository.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/\
  api/v1/cluster/self/repository/active/<repository-id>/pause \
  -u Administrator:password

curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/\
  api/v1/cluster/self/repository/active/<repository-id>/resume
  -u Administrator:password
----

The `username` and `password` must identify an administrator with the Full Admin role.
The `repository-id` argument must specify the name of an active repository defined on the cluster.

[#responses]
== Responses

For both URIs, success returns `200 OK`.
Note that neither resuming already running tasks nor pausing already paused tasks has any effect: both return `200 OK`.

An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`, and a message such as the following: `{"status":404,"msg":"could not find repository with id: testR3epo"}`.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following call pauses the running of tasks for the active repository `testRepo`:

----
curl -v -X POST  http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/active/testRepo/pause \
-u Administrator:password
----

Success returns `200 OK`.

The following call resumes the running of tasks for `testRepo`:

----
curl -v -X POST  http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/active/testRepo/resume \
-u Administrator:password
----

Again, success returns `200 OK`.
