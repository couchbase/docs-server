:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
The REST API can be used to _regenerate_ the cluster's root and node certificates.

== Description

When a one-node Couchbase Cluster is first created, a default _root_ certificate for the cluster is automatically provided: additionally, a default _node_ certificate, signed by the root certificate, is automatically provided for the node.
Subsequently, as further nodes are added to the cluster, each node is automatically assigned its own, default node certificate, signed by the root certificate.

These default root and node certificates support pre-production certificate-based authentication, including that required by node-to-node encryption.
However, being generated by the cluster itself, they provide only minimal security, and are not appropriate for production purposes.

Therefore, in preparation for a cluster's full, production deployment, a root certificate provided by an acknowledged authority should be uploaded to the cluster; and, on each node, an individual node certificate, signed by the new root, should be uploaded.

Should problems occur during or subsequent to the deployment of these new certificates, all certificates can be _regenerated_, using the `POST` method with the `/controller/regenerateCertificate` URI: this substitutes a default _root_ certificate and, on each node, a default node certificate, for those uploaded by the administrator.

To regenerate certificates, the administrator must have either the Full Admin or the Security Admin role.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/controller/regenerateCertificate \
-u <username>:<password>
----

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK` and the text of the regenerated, default root certificate.
An incorrect username-password combination fails with `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.
An attempt to regenerate certificates without either the Full Admin or the Security Admin role fails with either `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` with a notification such as `"message":"Forbidden. User needs one of the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.admin.security!write"]`.

[#example]
== Example

The following call regenerates the root and node certificates for the cluster of which node `10.143.201.101` is a member:

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/controller/regenerateCertificate \
-u Administrator:password
----

If the call succeeds, the text of the regenerated, default root certificate is returned.
For example:
