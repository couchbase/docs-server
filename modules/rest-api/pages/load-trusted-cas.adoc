== Description

Loads trusted CA (or 'root') certificates into the Couchbase-Server cluster.
All loaded CA certificates can be accessed by all nodes.
Certificates can be used to provide authority to the cluster's nodes, and can be used to authenticate clients' access-attempts.

Prior to being loaded, the trusted CA certificates must be copied into a folder named `inbox/CA`; which has been manually created by the administrator, in the appropriate platform-specific location:
