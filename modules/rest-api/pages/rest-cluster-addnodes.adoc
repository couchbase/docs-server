[#http-method-and-uri]
== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/addNode
----

[#description]
== Description

This adds a server node to the cluster.
One or more services can be specified to run on the added node.
These are `kv` (data), `index` (index), `n1ql` (query), `eventing` (eventing), `fts` (search), and `cbas` (analytics).
If no services are specified, the Data Service is enabled by default.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/controller/addNode
  -d hostname=[IPaddress]
  -d user=[username]
  -d password=[password]
  -d services=[kv|index|n1ql|fts|cbas|eventing]
----

Note that the administrative username and password must be specified.
If the new node has not yet been provisioned, placeholder names must be provided.

[#responses]
== Responses

Success gives `200 OK`, and returns an object of the form `{"otpNode":"ns_1@ip-address-of-added-node"}`, to confirm that the node has been added.
Specifying an unknown service gives `400 Bad Request`, and an object of the form `["Unknown services: [\"unknown-service-name\"]"]`.
If the node to be added has already been provisioned, and its administrative credentials are not properly specified, `400 Bad Request` is given, and an object is returned of the form `["Prepare join failed. Authentication failed. Verify username and password."]`

If the IP address of the new node is not accurately specified, or otherwise cannot be reached, `400 Bad Request` is given, and an object is returned of the form `["Failed to reach erlang port mapper at node \"ip-address-of-new-node\". Error: ehostunreach"]`.
If the IP address of the host cluster is not accurately specified, or otherwise cannot be reached, the request times out, giving `Empty reply from server`.
Failure to authenticate with the cluster gives `401 Unauthorized`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example adds a server node, `10.143.190.103`, to the cluster at `10.143.190.101:8091`, establishing the Data, Query, and Index Services on the new node.
The IP address for the new server and its administrative credentials are provided.

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/controller/addNode \
-d 'hostname=http://10.143.190.103' \
-d 'user=Administrator' \
-d 'password=password' \
-d 'services=kv,n1ql,index'
----

If successful, Couchbase Server responds as follows, identifying the node that has been added:

----
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.2.2.64"}
----

Subsequent to addition, the node must be rebalanced into the cluster.
