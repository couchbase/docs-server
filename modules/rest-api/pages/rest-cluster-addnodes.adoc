[#rest-cluster-add-nodes]
= Adding nodes to clusters

[abstract]
Nodes are added to clusters with the `POST /controller/addNode` HTTP method and URI.

== Syntax

This is a REST request made to a Couchbase Server cluster to add a server node to the cluster with a service: kv (data), index or n1ql (query).
If you add a node with no services specificied, the kv (the Data Service) will be enabled by default.
A new node is added with the RESTful endpoint `server_ip:port/controller/addNode`.
The administrative username and password parameters are required.

----
curl -u [admin]:[password]
  [localhost]:8091/controller/addNode 
  -d hostname=[IPaddress] user=[admin] password=[password] services=[kv|index|n1ql]

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/addNode

== Example

The following example request adds a server node, 10.2.2.64, to the cluster at 10.2.2.60:8091.
The POST method, `controller/addNode`,  IP address for the new server, and administrative credentials are provided.
Since the POST method is the default, it is not required in the request.

  10.2.2.60:8091/controller/addNode \
  -d 'hostname=10.2.2.64&user=Administrator&password=password&services=n1ql'
