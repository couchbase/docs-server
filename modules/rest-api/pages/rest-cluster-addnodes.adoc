= Adding Nodes to Clusters
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Nodes are added to clusters with the `POST /controller/addNode` HTTP method and URI.

== Syntax

This request adds a server node to the cluster.
One or more services can be specified to run on the added node.
These are `kv` (data), `index` (index), `n1ql` (query), `eventing` (eventing), `fts` (search), and `cbas` (analytics).
If no services are specified, the Data Service is enabled by default.
The node is added with the endpoint `server_ip:port/controller/addNode` endpoint.
The administrative username and password must be specified.

----
curl -u [admin]:[password]
  [localhost]:8091/controller/addNode
  -d hostname=[IPaddress] user=[admin] password=[password] services=[kv|index|n1ql|fts|cbas|eventing]
----

After adding a node to the cluster, remember to rebalance the cluster.
See xref:rest-cluster-rebalance.adoc[Rebalancing Nodes] for details.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/addNode
----

== Example

The following example adds a server node, 10.2.2.64, to the cluster at 10.2.2.60:8091, establishing the Data, Query, and Index Services on the new node.
The POST method, `controller/addNode`,  IP address for the new server, and administrative credentials are provided.
Since the POST method is the default, it is not required in the request.

----
curl -u Administrator:password \
  10.2.2.60:8091/controller/addNode \
  -d 'hostname=10.2.2.64&user=Administrator&password=password&services=kv,n1ql,index'
----

== Response

If successful, Couchbase Server responds as follows, identifying the node that has been added:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.2.2.64"}
