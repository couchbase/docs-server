= Adding Nodes to Clusters

[abstract]
Nodes are added to clusters with the `POST /controller/addNode` HTTP method and URI.

== Syntax

This is a REST request made to a Couchbase Server cluster to add a server node to the cluster with a service: kv (data), index or n1ql (query).
If you add a node with no services specified, the kv (the Data Service) will be enabled by default.
A new node is added with the RESTful endpoint `server_ip:port/controller/addNode`.
The administrative username and password parameters are required.

----
curl -u [admin]:[password]
  [localhost]:8091/controller/addNode
  -d hostname=[IPaddress] user=[admin] password=[password] services=[kv|index|n1ql|fts]
----

After adding a node to the cluster, remember to rebalance the cluster.
See xref:rest-cluster-rebalance.adoc#rest-cluster-rebalance-nodes[Rebalancing Nodes] for details.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/addNode
----

== Example

The following example request adds a server node, 10.2.2.64, to the cluster at 10.2.2.60:8091.
The POST method, `controller/addNode`,  IP address for the new server, and administrative credentials are provided.
Since the POST method is the default, it is not required in the request.

----
curl -u Administrator:password \
  10.2.2.60:8091/controller/addNode \
  -d 'hostname=10.2.2.64&user=Administrator&password=password&services=n1ql'
----

== Response

If successful, Couchbase Server responds:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.4.2.6"}
----
