= Creating and Editing Buckets

[abstract]
To create and edit buckets, use the `POST` operation with the `/pools/default/buckets` URI.

== Description

Buckets are created and edited with a `POST` sent to the REST URI endpoint for buckets in a cluster.
This can be used to create either a Couchbase or a Memcached type bucket.
Bucket names cannot have a leading underscore.

This endpoint is also used to get a list of buckets that exist for a cluster.

IMPORTANT: When editing bucket properties, be sure to  specify all bucket properties.
If a bucket property is not specified (whether or not you are changing the existing value), Couchbase Server may reset the property to the default.
Even if you do not intend to change a certain property, re-specify the existing value to avoid this behavior.

The REST API returns a successful response when preliminary files for a data bucket are created on one node.
However, if a multi-node cluster is implemented, bucket creation may not have completed for all nodes when a response is sent.
Therefore, it is possible that the bucket is not available for operations immediately after this REST call successful returns.

To verify that a bucket is available, try to read a key from the bucket.
If a ‘key not found’ error is received or the document for the key is returned, then the bucket exists and is available to all nodes in a cluster.
Key requests can be issued via a Couchbase Server SDK with any node in the cluster.
See the _Couchbase Server Developer Guide_ for more information.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/buckets
----

* Request data - List of payload parameters for the new bucket
* Response data - JSON of the bucket confirmation or an error condition
* Authentication required - Yes

Parameters for creating buckets:

.Create bucket parameters
[cols="100,237"]
|===
| Payload Arguments | Description

| `authType`
| Required parameter.
Type of authorization to be enabled for the new bucket as a string.
Defaults to blank password if not specified.
"sasl" enables authentication.
"none" disables authentication.

| `bucketType`
| Required parameter.
Type of bucket to be created.
String value.
"memcached" configures as Memcached bucket.
"couchbase" configures as Couchbase bucket.
This cannot be changed for a pre-existing bucket.

| `conflictResolutionType`
| Optional parameter.
String value '[.input]`lww`' (timestamp-based conflict resolution) or '[.input]`seqno`' (revision ID-based conflict resolution).
This parameter defaults to '`seqno`' if unspecified.
This cannot be changed once a bucket has been created.

| `evictionPolicy`
| Optional parameter, a string.
Possible values are `fullEviction` and `valueOnly`.
The default is `valueOnly`.
This parameter determines what is ejected: only the value or the key, value, and all metadata.

If you change the ejection policy of a pre-existing bucket then it will be restarted, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.

| `flushEnabled`
| Optional parameter.
Enables the ‘flush all’ functionality on the specified bucket.
Boolean.
1 enables flush all support, 0 disables flush all support.
Defaults to 0.

| `name`
| Required parameter.
Name for new bucket.
This cannot be changed for a pre-existing bucket.

| `parallelDBAndViewCompaction`
| Optional parameter.
String value.
Indicates whether database and view files on disk can be compacted simultaneously.
Defaults to "false."

| `proxyPort`
| Required parameter.
Numeric.
Proxy port on which the bucket communicates.
Must be a valid network port which is not already in use.
You must provide a valid port number if the authorization type is not SASL.

| `ramQuotaMB`
| Required parameter.
RAM Quota for new bucket in MB.
Numeric.
The minimum you can specify is 100, and the maximum can only be as great as the memory quota established for the node.
If other buckets are associated with a node, RAM Quota can only be as large as the amount memory remaining for the node, accounting for the other bucket memory quota.

| `replicaIndex`
| Optional parameter.
Boolean.
1 enable replica indexes for replica bucket data while 0 disables.
Default of 1.
This cannot be changed for a pre-existing bucket.

| `replicaNumber`
| Optional parameter.
Numeric.
Number of replicas to be configured for this bucket.
Required parameter when creating a Couchbase bucket.
Default 1, minimum 0, maximum 3.

| `saslPassword`
| Optional Parameter.
String.
Password for SASL authentication.
Required if SASL authentication has been enabled.

| `threadsNumber`
| Optional Parameter.
Integer from 2 to 8.
Change the number of concurrent readers and writers for the data bucket.

If you change this setting for a pre-existing bucket then it will be restarted, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.
|===

When creating a bucket, the `authType` parameter must be provided:

* If `authType` is set to `none`, then a proxyPort number must be specified.
* If `authType` is set to `sasl`, then the `saslPassword` parameter may optionally be specified.

The `ramQuotaMB` parameter specifies how much memory, in megabytes, is allocate to each node for the bucket.
The minimum supported value is 100MB.

* If the items stored in a memcached bucket take space beyond the `ramQuotaMB`, Couchbase Sever typically evicts items on a least-requested-item basis.
Couchbase Server might evict other infrequently used items depending on object size or on whether or not an item is being referenced.
* In the case of Couchbase buckets, the system might return temporary failures if the `ramQuotaMB` is reached.
The system tries to keep 25% of the available ramQuotaMB free for new items by ejecting old items from occupying memory.
In the event these items are later requested, they are retrieved from disk.

== Syntax

Curl request syntax:

----
curl -X POST -u [admin]:[password] 
  -d name=[new-bucket-name] -d ramQuotaMB=[value] -d authType=[none | sasl] 
  -d replicaNumber=[value] 
  -d proxyPort=[proxy-port]   
  http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/buckets
----

== Example

Curl request example:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
  -d 'name=newbucket' -d 'ramQuotaMB=20'0 -d 'authType=none' \
  -d 'replicaNumber=2' \
  -d 'proxyPort=11215' \   
  http://10.5.2.54:8091/pools/default/buckets
----

Curl request example to set conflict resolution type:

Set the parameter [.param]`conflictResolutionType` to `lww` during bucket creation.
For example, use the following command to create a bucket on the source cluster:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd http://<ip_address>:8091/pools/default/buckets 
-d name=newBucketSource -d conflictResolutionType=lww 
-d authType=sasl -d ramQuotaMB=4096 
-d saslPassword=passw0rd -d bucketType=couchbase
----

Use the following command to create a bucket on the destination cluster:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd http://<ip_address>:8091/pools/default/buckets 
-d name=newBucketDestination -d conflictResolutionType=lww 
-d authType=sasl -d ramQuotaMB=4096 
-d saslPassword=passw0rd -d bucketType=couchbase
----

Raw HTTP request example:

The parameters for configuring the bucket are provided as payload data.
Each parameter and value are provided as a key/value pair where each pair is separated by an ampersand.
Include the parameters setting in the payload of the HTTP `POST` request.

----
POST /pools/default/buckets
HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.5.2.54:8091
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

----

== Response

If the bucket creation was successful, HTTP response 202 (Accepted) is returned with empty content.

----
202 Accepted
----

== Response codes

If the bucket could not be created, because the parameter was missing or incorrect, HTTP response 400 returns, with a JSON payload containing the error reason.
