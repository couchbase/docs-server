== HTTP methods and URI

----
PUT /node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external
DELETE /node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external
----

[#rest-setup-alternate-address-description]
== Description

A single, alternate address can be established for and removed from a node.
Likewise, a single alternate port-number can be established for and removed from each node-service.
This facilitates communication with external applications that are not permitted to contact nodes directly; but have access to a router or other networked entity that provides interfaces on the cluster's behalf.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X PUT -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[ip-address]:8091/node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external
  [-d hostname=<alternate-address> ]
  [-d <service-name>=<alternate-port-number> ]

curl -v -X DELETE -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[ip-address]:8091/node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external
----

The parameters are:

* `localhost`.
The address of the cluster-node to which an alternate address is to be assigned.
* `hostname`.
The alternate address to be assigned to the cluster-node.
This can be either a _hostname_ or an _IP address_ (either V4 or V6).
* `service`.
Optionally, one or more service-names corresponding to services running on the node, each service-name being specified with an alternate port number.
Possible service-names are `kv` (Data Service), `index` (Index Service), `n1ql` (Query Service), `fts` (Search Service), `cbas` (Analytics Service), and `eventing` (Eventing Service).
Each successive use of the `PUT` method entirely deletes all previous alternate settings (hostname and service) on the node.
The `DELETE` method deletes all alternate settings (hostname and service).

[#responses]
== Responses

For both methods, success gives the status `200 OK`, with no object returned.

If no hostname is specified, the message `hostname should be specified` is displayed.

If either method is used to specify an unknown node, the message `No route to host` is given, and the call fails.

Specifying an invalid service-name gives the status `400 Bad Request`, with the message `Invalid Port "<submitted-service-name>" : No such port.`


[#examples]
== Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to assign alternate addresses and port-numbers, and how to remove them.

[#assign-alternate-address-and-port-numbers]
=== Assign an Alternate Address and Port-Numbers

To assign an alternate address and alternate port-numbers, use the `PUT /node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external` method and URI.

----
curl -v -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external \
-d hostname=10.10.10.11 \
-d kv=9000 \
-d n1ql=9050
----

This assigns the alternate address `10.10.10.11` to node `10.143.192.101`, and the alternate port-numbers `9000` and `9050` to the Data and Query Services, respectively.
No object is returned.

[#list-alternate-addresses-and-port-numbers]
=== List Alternate Addresses and Port Numbers

To list alternate addresses and port numbers, use the `GET /pools/default/nodeServices` method and URI.
In the following example, the output is piped to the `jq` tool, to optimize readability.

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/nodeServices | jq
----

The output is as follows:

----
{
  "rev": 2142,
  "nodesExt": [
    {
      "services": {
        "mgmt": 8091,
        "mgmtSSL": 18091,
        "eventingAdminPort": 8096,
        "eventingDebug": 9140,
        "eventingSSL": 18096,
        "indexAdmin": 9100,
        "indexScan": 9101,
        "indexHttp": 9102,
        "indexStreamInit": 9103,
        "indexStreamCatchup": 9104,
        "indexStreamMaint": 9105,
        "indexHttps": 19102,
        "kv": 11210,
        "kvSSL": 11207,
        "capi": 8092,
        "capiSSL": 18092,
        "projector": 9999,
        "n1ql": 8093,
        "n1qlSSL": 18093
      },
      "thisNode": true,
      "hostname": "10.143.192.101",
      "alternateAddresses": {
        "external": {
          "hostname": "10.10.10.11",
          "ports": {
            "kv": 9000,
            "n1ql": 9050
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "clusterCapabilitiesVer": [
    1,
    0
  ],
  "clusterCapabilities": {
    "n1ql": [
      "enhancedPreparedStatements"
    ]
  }
}
----

The output shows, in the internal `alternateAddresses` object, the specified alternate hostname, and the alternate port-numbers for the Data and Query Services.

[#remove-alternate-addresses-and-port-numbers]
=== Remove Alternate Addresses and Port Numbers

The following example removes the alternate address and all alternate port numbers from the specified node.

----
curl -v -X DELETE -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/node/controller/setupAlternateAddresses/external
----

If the call is successful, the status `200 OK` is provided.
The results can be checked as before:

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/nodeServices | jq
----

This now produces the following output:

----
{
  "rev": 2143,
  "nodesExt": [
    {
      "services": {
        "mgmt": 8091,
        "mgmtSSL": 18091,
        "eventingAdminPort": 8096,
        "eventingDebug": 9140,
        "eventingSSL": 18096,
        "indexAdmin": 9100,
        "indexScan": 9101,
        "indexHttp": 9102,
        "indexStreamInit": 9103,
        "indexStreamCatchup": 9104,
        "indexStreamMaint": 9105,
        "indexHttps": 19102,
        "kv": 11210,
        "kvSSL": 11207,
        "capi": 8092,
        "capiSSL": 18092,
        "projector": 9999,
        "n1ql": 8093,
        "n1qlSSL": 18093
      },
      "thisNode": true,
      "hostname": "10.143.192.101"
    }
  ],
  "clusterCapabilitiesVer": [
    1,
    0
  ],
  "clusterCapabilities": {
    "n1ql": [
      "enhancedPreparedStatements"
    ]
  }
}
----

The internal `alternateAddresses` object has been removed; indicating that the alternate address and port numbers no longer exist.
