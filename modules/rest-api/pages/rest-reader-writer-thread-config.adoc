== Description

Couchbase Server allows the number of threads allocated per node for reading and writing to be configured by the administrator.
The maximum thread-allocation for each is _64_, the minimum _4_.

A high thread-allocation may improve performance on systems whose hardware-resources are commensurately supportive (for example, where the number of CPU cores is high).
In particular, a high number of _writer_ threads on such systems may significantly optimize the performance of _durable writes_: see xref:learn:data/durability.adoc[Durability], for information.

Note, however, that a high thread-allocation might _impair_ some aspects of performance on less appropriately resourced nodes.
Consequently, changes to the default thread-allocation should not be made to production systems without prior testing.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST -d hostname=<host>:<port>
  -d num_reader_threads=<int>
  -d num_writer_threads=<int>
  -d password=<password>
  -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<host>:<port>/pools/default/settings/memcached/global
----

The value of `int` must be an integer between `4` and `64`, inclusive.

Success returns an object whose values confirm the settings that have been made.

[#examples]
== Examples

To set the number of reader and writer threads for Couchbase Server, use the `POST /pools/default/settings/memcached/global` http method and endpoint as follows:

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.192.101:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global \
-d num_reader_threads=12 \
-d num_writer_threads=8
----

This sets the number of _reader_ threads to `12`, and the number of _writer_ threads to `8`.
If successful, the call returns an object whose values confirm the settings that have been made:

----
{"num_reader_threads":12,"num_writer_threads":8}
----
