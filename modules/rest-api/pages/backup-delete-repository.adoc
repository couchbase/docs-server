= Delete a Repository

[abstract]
The Backup Service REST API allows an archived repository to be deleted.

[#http-methods-and-uris]
== HTTP Methods and URIs

----
DELETE /cluster/self/repository/archived/<repository-id>

DELETE /cluster/self/repository/archived/<repository-id>"?remove_repository=true"
----

[#description]
== Description

These delete an _archived_ repository.
They cannot be used on a repository that is either _active_ or _imported_.
No other interfaces for repository-deletion are provided: therefore, in order to be deleted, a repository must first be archived.
For information on archiving a repository, see xref:rest-api:backup-archive-a-repository.adoc[Archive a Repository].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/cluster/self\
  /repository/archived/<repository-id>

curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/cluster/self\
  /repository/archived/<repository-id>"?remove_repository=true"
----

The `repository-id` argument must be the name of a currently active repository.
If `repository-id` is specified with the `remove_repository=true` query-parameter, the repository data is removed from disk, as well as being removed from the Backup Service.
If `repository-id` is specified without the query-paramter, the repository is removed from the Backup Service, but remains on disk.

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
If the specified repository cannot be found, or if the URI is otherwise incorrectly specified, `404 Object Not Found` is returned.
If the query-parameter is incorrectly specified, `400 Bad Request` is returned.
If an internal server error prevents deletion of the repository, `500 Internal Server Error` is returned.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.


[#examples]
== Examples

The following call deletes the archived repository `quickRepo`:

----
curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/archived/quickRepo \
-u Administrator:password
----

Success returns `200 OK`, and the archived repository is deleted from the Backup Service.
However, since the query-parameter has _not_ been specified, the repository and its data survive on disk.

The following call deletes the archived repository `oldRepo`, specifying the query-parameter:

----
curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/archived/oldRepo?remove_repository=true \
-u Administrator:password
----

Success returns `200 OK`.
Since the query-parameter `remove_repository=true` has been specified, the archived repository is deleted both from the Backup Service and from disk.
