= Role Based Admin Access (RBAC)

[abstract]
Full Administrators can manage the Couchbase _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC) system, using the REST API.

== GET /settings/rbac/roles

*Description*

This command retrieves information about the available roles.

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X GET http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/roles

== GET /settings/rbac/users

*Description*

This command retrieves information about the current users and the roles assigned to them.

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X GET http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users

== PUT /settings/rbac/users/<user_id>

*Description*

This command sets the name and roles for the specified user ID.
Note that the new user's password is expected to be accessible, when authentication is subsequently attempted, from an external domain.

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X PUT http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/<user_id>

== PUT /settings/rbac/users/local/<user_id>

*Description*

This command sets name, role, and password for the specified user ID.
Note that by these means, the new user is defined locally to Couchbase Server (the user's password having been provided as a parameter to this command).

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X PUT http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/local/<user_id>

== DELETE /settings/rbac/users/<user_id>

*Description*

This command deletes the specified user.

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X DELETE http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/<user_id>

== POST /pools/default/checkPermissions

*Description*

This command checks the permissions on specified Couchbase Server-resources that have been assigned to the administrator whose credentials are specified in the command.

*Syntax:*

 $ curl -X POST http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/checkPermissions

== Examples

Get a list of available roles::
+
----
GET /settings/rbac/roles
----
+
Returns an array of objects whose fields explain the available roles on the system.
The first and second objects in the array might appear as follows:
+
----
[
  {
  "role": "replication_target",
  "bucket_name": "*",
  "name": "Replication Target",
  "desc": "XDC replication target for bucket"
  },
  {
  "role": "query_external_access",
  "name": "Query External Access",
  "desc": "Can execute CURL statement"
  },
              .
              .
----

Get a list of all current users and the roles they are assigned.::
+
----
GET /settings/rbac/users
----
+
For example:
+
[source,console]
----
$ curl -X GET http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users

[
  {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "id": "johnsmith",
    "domain": "local",
    "roles": [
      {
        "role": "cluster_admin"
      }
    ]
  }
]
----

Set the name, user ID, and roles for a new user.::
+
----
PUT /settings/rbac/users/<user_id>
----
+
In this example, John Doe is assigned to be Cluster Administrator, and also to be Bucket Administrator for the `travel-sample` bucket, with user ID of `johndoe`:

 $ curl -X PUT --data "name=John Doe&roles=cluster_admin,bucket_admin[travel-sample]" \
               http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/johndoe
+
Note that by means of the command above, the user is listed by Couchbase Server as being in the _External_ authentication domain: this means that the user ID specified here is expected to match a user ID by which they are registered (with an appropriate password) on a _remote_ (for example, an _LDAP_) system.
If the user ID specified in this command does not so match, the user is permitted no access to Couchbase Server-resources.
See below for an example of adding user and roles by specifying a password to be stored locally.
See xref:security:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication] for more information on defining users remotely.

Set the name, user ID, roles, and password for a new user.::
+
----
PUT /settings/rbac/users/local/<user_id>
----
+
In this example, John Smith is assigned to be the Cluster Administrator, with password specified as `jspassword`, and user ID as `johnsmith`:

 $ curl -X PUT --data "name=John Smith&roles=cluster_admin&password=jspassword" \
              -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
              http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/local/johnsmith
+
Note that by means of the command above, the user is assigned to the _Local_ authentication domain: this means that they have been registered on Couchbase Server itself, with the password specified.

Delete users::
+
----
DELETE /settings/rbac/users/<user_id>
----
+
In this example, the user identified by the user ID `alicesmith` is deleted.

 $ curl -X DELETE http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/rbac/users/alicesmith

Check permissions::
+
----
POST /pools/default/checkPermissions
----
+
The following example checks the authenticating administrator's permissions on the `travel-sample` bucket, for reading bucket-statistics and for writing to the bucket:

 $ curl -X POST --data 'cluster.bucket[travel-sample].stats!read,cluster.bucket[travel-sample]!write' \
             http://Administrator:adminpwd@127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/checkPermissions
+
Output might appear as follows:
+
----
{
"cluster.bucket[travel-sample].stats!read": true,
"cluster.bucket[default]!write": true
}
----

== Reading Log Output

The following examples of log output are provided, with comments to aid understanding..

----
{"name":"John Doe","id":"johndoe","roles":[{"role":"admin"}]}]
        {'status': '200', 'content-length': '64', 'server': 'Couchbase Server', 'pragma': 'no-cache', \
        'cache-control': 'no-cache', 'date': 'Mon, 13 Jun 2016 10:35:28 GMT',  'content-type': 'application/json’}
----

The first two lines indicate what is the admin role for the user John Doe.
His role is set as admin.

Each role has a set permission and each permission has a list of resources: cluster_indexes_write – This is one of the permission for admin role.

----

Above is an example of failure since it includes the message "Matching not found".
In this case, it is not an actual error because the values have not been passed correctly to /diag/eval correctly.
