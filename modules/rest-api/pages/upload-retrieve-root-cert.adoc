= Upload and Retrieve the Root Certificate
:page-topic-type: reference
:page-aliases: rest-api:security-encrypted-access

[abstract]
The REST API can be used to upload and retrieve the cluster's root certificate.
It can also be used to retrieve information on the cluster, by referencing a copy of the root certificate.

[#http-method-and-uri]
== Http Methods and URIs

----
POST /controller/uploadClusterCA

GET /pools/default/certificate

GET /pools/default
----

[#description]
== Description

The `POST` method and `/controller/uploadClusterCA` URI upload an appropriately configured certificate to the cluster, so that it becomes the root certificate for the cluster.
Either the Full Admin or the Security Admin role is required.
The certificate must be specified as binary data, in a location on the filesystem, for successful upload to occur.

The `GET` method and `/pools/default/certificate` URI make a copy of the cluster's current root certificate, and returns the copy.
This call is authorized for all Couchbase Server roles.

The `GET` method and `/pools/default` URI return an object containing cluster information


[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax for each call is as follows:

----
curl -X POST
  --data-binary "@./ca.pem"
  http://<ip-address-or-host-name>:8091/controller/uploadClusterCA
  -u <username>:<password>

curl -X GET
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/certificate
  -u <username>:<password>

curl -X GET
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:18091/pools/default
  --cacert <copy-of-current-root-certificate>
  -u <username>:<password>
----

[#descriptions]
== Descriptions

The certificate specified for upload to the `POST` method must be an appropriately configured binary, accessible by means of the given path.
The certificate must be named `ca.pem`.

The certificate-copy returned by the `GET` method and `/pools/default/certificate` URI should be appropriately saved: for example, with `> <certificate-copy-name>`, on the local filesystem.

The argument to the `cacert` flag used by `GET /pools/default` must be a copy of the current root certificate for the current cluster.
If the current node is specified, the `<ip-address-or-domain-name` can be the _loopback_ IP address, `127.0.0.1`.
An object containing information on the current cluster is returned and displayed.

Note that `GET /pools/default` must employ _secure access_ to Couchbase Server, via the secure port `18091`.

[#responses]
== Responses

For the `POST` method, success gives `200 OK`, and returns the readable text of the uploaded certificate.
Additionally, warnings may be displayed &#8212; for example, if the root certificate is uploaded (as may be expected) _prior_ to the uploading of corresponding node certificates (whereby the current node certificates have not been signed by the new root), the warning may be as follows: `[{"node":"ns_1@127.0.0.1","message":"Certificate is not signed with cluster CA."}]`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to specify an appropriately configured certificate fails with `400 Bad Request` and the notification `{"error":"Malformed certificate"}` (the message `Couldn't read data from file` may also be displayed).
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.

For the `GET` method and `/pools/default/certificate` URI, success gives `200 OK`, and returns the readable text of the uploaded certificate.
A malformed URI fails, with `404 Object Not Found`.
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.

For the `GET` method and `/pools/default` URI, success gives `200 OK`, and displays an object containing information on the current cluster.
A malformed URI fails, with `404 Object Not Found`.
An incorrectly specified IP address or domain name causes the attempted connection to time out, with a `Failed to connect` notification.

== Examples

The following example uploads an appropriately configured root certificate:

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.143.201.101:8091/controller/uploadClusterCA \
--data-binary "@./ca.pem" \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and displays the following output:

----
{"cert":{"type":"uploaded","pem":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIDCzCCAfOgAwIBAgIJ
    .
    .
    .
AH\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n","subject":"CN=Couchbase Root CA","expires":"2030-08 22T03:14:49.000Z"},"warnings":[{"node":"ns_1@127.0.0.1","message":"Certificate is not
signed with cluster CA."}]}
----

The output thus displays in readable form the body of the new root certificate (shown here in truncated form).
It also provides, in this case, a warning: indicating that the node certificate for the node is not yet one signed by the new root certificate.
This can be remedied by uploadoing an appropriately signed, new node certificate.

The following example retrieves the current root certificate:

----
curl -v -X GET http://10.143.201.101:8091/pools/default/certificate \
-u Administrator:password > cert-copy.pem
----

If successful, this returns `200 OK`, with a copy of the current root certificate.
This can be inspected at the command line, with a tool such as `more`.

[#using-root-cert-to-return-cluster-info]
=== Using a Root Certificate to Return Cluster Information

Once retrieved, a root certificate can be used with either the `curl` or the `wget` command, to return information on the current cluster.

The following example shows how to use `curl` in this way.
The file `cert-copy` is a copy of the root certificate, already retrieved by means of `GET /pools/default/certificate`:

----
curl -v -X GET https://127.0.0.1:18091/pools/default \
--cacert ./new-cert-copy \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK` and displays an object containing cluster information.
The initial sections of this object, appropriately formatted, may appear as follows:

----
{
  "name": "default",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "systemStats": {
        "cpu_utilization_rate": 17.97752808988764,
        "cpu_stolen_rate": 0,

            .
            .
            .
----

The command `wget` can be similarly used, as follows:

----
wget --ca-certificate ./new-cert-copy \
https://127.0.0.1:18091/pools/default -O output \
--user Administrator --password password
----

Note that `wget` here uses the secure port `18091`.
The returned object is written to the file `output`.
