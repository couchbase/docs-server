= Creating XDCR Replications
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
To create an XDCR replication, use the `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/createReplication

[#description]
== Description

Data replication occurs from a source cluster to a destination cluster.
Once a replication is created, data replication between clusters automatically begins.

----

The `type` values, `capi` and `xmem`, are respectively represented by *Version 1* and *Version 2*, in the web console.
The default value is `xmem`.
If the default is to be used, this parameter does not need to be specified.

The `replicationType` value is always `continuous`.
This value must be specified.

The value of `compressionType` value can be either `Auto` or `None`:

* If `Auto` is specified, data compression _is_ provided during replication, provided that the target cluster is running Couchbase Server 5.5 or later.
If the target cluster is _not_ running Couchbase Server 5.5 or later, data compression is _not_ provided during replication.
(Note that the consequences of specifying `Auto` as the value of `compressionType` are thereby determined irrespective of whether the data resides in the source bucket in compressed or uncompressed form.)

* If `None` is specified, data compression is not provided during replication if the target cluster is not running Couchbase Server 5.5 or later.
If the target cluster _is_ running Couchbase Server 5.5 or later:

** If the data resides in the source bucket in uncompressed form, data compression is _not_ provided.

** If the data resides in the source bucket in _compressed_ form, data compression _is_ provided.

The optional `filterExpression` is matched against the ids, field-names, values, and extended attributes of documents in the source bucket.
Each document that produces a successful match is replicated; other documents are not replicated.
For supported expressions, see xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering Reference].

The `filterDeletion` and `filterExpiration` flags indicate whether mutations corresponding respectively to the deletion and expiration of documents on the source cluster should be either _filtered out_ of the replication to the target cluster, or allowed to remain in.
For each flag, a value of `true` means that the mutation _is_ filtered out, ensuring that it is _not_ replicated to the target cluster; while a value of `false` (the default) means that the mutation is _not_ filtered out, ensuring that it _is_ replicated to the target cluster.
The default value for both flags is `false`.

The `filterBypassExpiry` flag indicates whether a document's TTL should be replicated with the document or not.
A value of `true` means that the TTL is removed from the document.
The default value is `false`.

The `filterSkipRestream` flag indicates whether the replication should be either restarted or allowed to continue without restarting, following modification of the value of `filterExpression`.
A value of `true` means that the replication should be allowed to continue without restarting.
A value of `false` (the default) means that the replication should be restarted.
For more information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc#filter-expression-editing[Filter-Expression Editing].

The `priority` flag controls resource-allocation to the replication.
The value can be `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.
The default value is `High`.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-priority[XDCR Priority].

The optional `network_type` flag determines whether _internal_ or _alternate_ IP addresses are used when communicating with the target cluster.
A value of `default` enforces the use of internal IP addresses.
A value of `external` enforces the use of alternate IP addresses, whenever possible.
For information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#alternate-addresses[Alternate Addresses].

For information on all other flags, see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-adv-settings.adoc[Managing Advanced XDCR Settings].

[#responses]
== Responses

If successful, the command returns `200 OK`, and an object containing an `id` for the new replication: this can be used, when appropriate, to delete the replication.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
A URI featuring an incorrect hostname or port returns a `failure to connect` message.
Referencing an unknown source bucket returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object referencing the unknown bucket-name.
For example:

----
{
  "errors": {
    "fromBucket": "Error validating source bucket 'source'. err=BucketValidationInfo Operation failed after max retries.  Last error: Bucket doesn't exist"
  }
}
----

Referencing an unknown cluster returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object referencing the unknown cluster-name:

----
{
  "errors": {
    "toCluster": "cannot find remote cluster\n err = unknown remote cluster : refName - 10.143.191.102"
  }
}
----

Referencing an unknown target bucket returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object referencing the unknown bucket-name:
----
{
  "errors": {
    "toBucket": "Error validating target bucket 'remote'. err=BucketValidationInfo Operation failed after max retries.  Last error: Bucket doesn't exist"
  }
}
----

[#example]
== Example

The following example creates a replication between the `source` and `remote` buckets.
The `remote` bucket is located on a cluster named `10.142.171.101`.
Note that data compression is enabled, by specifying the value `1` (specifying `0` disables compression).

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://127.0.0.1:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d fromBucket=source \
-d toCluster=10.142.171.101 \
-d toBucket=remote \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d compressionType="Snappy"
----

If the call is successful, data replication immediately begins, and a response similar to the following is returned.

----
{
  "id": "9eee38236f3bf28406920213d93981a3/beer-sample/remote_beer"
}
----

The `id` returned in the document can be used to delete the replication, when appropriate.
