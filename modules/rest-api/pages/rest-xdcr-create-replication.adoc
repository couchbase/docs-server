= Creating XDCR Replications

[abstract]
To create an XDCR replication, use the `POST /controller/createReplication` HTTP method and URI.

== Description

Data replication occurs from a source cluster to a destination cluster.
Once a replication is created, data replication between clusters automatically begins.

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /controller/createReplication
----

== Syntax

Curl request syntax:

----
curl -v -X POST -u [admin]:[password] 
  http://[localhost]:[port]/controller/createReplication
  -d fromBucket=[bucket-name]
  -d toCluster=[cluster-name]
  -d toBucket=[bucket-name]
  -d replicationType=continuous
  -d type=[capi | xmem]
  -d enableCompression=[0 | 1]
----

NOTE: The `type` values, capi and xmem, are represented by version1 and version2 in the web console.
Default: `xmem`.
Because `xmem` is the default for `Type`, this parameter is not required when creating `xmem` replications.
The `replicationType` value is always `continuous`.

== Example

The following example creates a replication between the `source` and `remote` buckets.
The `remote` bucket is located on a cluster named `10.142.171.101`.
Note that data compression is enabled, by specifying the value `1` (specifying `0` disables compression).

----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://127.0.0.1:8091/controller/createReplication \
-d fromBucket=source \
-d toCluster=10.142.171.101 \
-d toBucket=remote \
-d replicationType=continuous \
-d enableCompression=1

Raw HTTP request:

----
POST / HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic QWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjpwYXNzd29yZDE=
User-Agent: curl/7.21.4 (universal-apple-darwin11.0) libcurl/7.21.4 OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.5

Accept: */*

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
----

== Response

If the replication is created, data replication immediately begins replicating data from the source to destination cluster and a response similar to the following is returned.

----
{
  "id": "9eee38236f3bf28406920213d93981a3/beer-sample/remote_beer"
  }
----

The unique document ID returned in the JSON is a reference that is used to delete the replication.
