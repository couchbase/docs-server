== HTTP Method and URI

----
GET /settings/security/responseHeaders

POST /settings/security/responseHeaders

DELETE /settings/security/responseHeaders
----

== Description

Establishes an _HTTP Secure Transport Header (HSTS)_; so as to inform the Web-Console browser never to load a site using HTTP; and instead, to automatically convert all access-requests from HTTP to HTTPS. 
Only the _Strict-Transport-Security_ header is supported.

Three _sub-settings_ must be established, which are:

** The duration of HTTPS-enforcement for this browser.

** Whether the site's subdomains are to be covered by the setting.

** Whether the _preload_ directive should be set; so that the policy is enforced before any communication takes place.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders

curl -X POST -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders
  -d <transport-security-specification>

  curl -X DELETE -u <administrator>:<password>
    http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders
----

The `transport-security-specification` specified with POST must be JSON object that takes the following form:

----
{
  Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<integer>;[includeSubDomains];[preload]
}
----

The value specified for the `Strict-Transport-Security` key is a valid HSTS header, which will be used by the browser.
The `integer` specified for `max-age` determines the number of seconds for which HTTPS is mandated for this browser.
The optional `includeSubDomains` keyword, if specified, determines that all the subdomains for this site are to be covered by the specification.
The optional `preload` keyword, if specified, determines that the specification is to be _preloaded_, to ensure that it becomes active even before any subsequent communication is attempted.

[#responses]
== Responses

The `GET` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`.
If a setting has been made, an object containing the valid header is returned.
If no setting has been made, an empty array is returned.

The `POST` method, if successful, gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

The `DELETE` method, if successful, also gives `200 OK`, and returns an empty array.

For both methods, an incorrect URI gives `404 Object Not Found`, with a `Not found` error message.
Use of improper credentials gives `401 Unauthorized`.
An improper port number returns an error message such as `Failed to connect to localhost port 8094: Connection refused`.

For the `POST` method, incorrectly specified parameters fail with `400 Bad Request`, and return an object such as the following: `{"errors":["responseHeaders - Invalid format. Expecting a json."]}`.

== Examples

The methods and the URI can be used as shown below.

=== Establish HSTS

The following call establishes a _Strict-Transport-Security_ heading for the browser:

----
curl -v -X POST localhost:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders \
-u Administrator:password \
-d {"Strict-Transport-Security":"max-age=31536000;includeSubDomains;preload"}'
----

This establishes that only HTTPS connections are accepted by this browser, and that this covers all subdomains for this site: it also specifies that this security constraint should be _preloaded_, so that it will be enforced even before any subsequent connection is attempted.
The integer that is the value of `max-age` specifies the number of seconds during which the constraint should be maintained: this constitutes _one year_.

The following, alternative call establishes a different header:

----
curl -v -X POST localhost:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders \
-u Administrator:password \
-d {"Strict-Transport-Security":"max-age=31536000"}'
----

This again specifies that only HTTPS connections are accepted for the next year.
However, the setting does not cover subdomains, and will not be preloaded.

==== Get the Current HSTS Setting

The following call returns the current HSTS setting, if one has indeed been established:

----
curl -v -GET localhost:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders \
-u Administrator:password
----

If no setting has been established, an empty array is returned.
Otherwise, an object containing the setting is returned.
For example:

----
{"Strict-Transport-Security":"max-age=31536000"}
----

==== Delete the Current HSTS Setting

The following call deletes the current HSTS setting, if one exists.

----
curl -v -X DELETE localhost:8091/settings/security/responseHeaders \
-u Administrator:password
----

The call always returns an empty array.
