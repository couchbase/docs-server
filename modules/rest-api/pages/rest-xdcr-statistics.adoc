=== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /pools/default/buckets/<source_or_target_bucket>/stats/

GET /pools/default/buckets/[source_bucket]/stats/[replications/<remote_UUID>/<source_bucket>/<target_bucket>/<statistic_name>]
----

The endpoint `/pools/default/buckets/<source_or_target_bucket>/stats/` returns all statistical information for replications either _from_ or _to_ the specified bucket -- depending on whether the replication's source or target bucket is specified.

Information on a statistic for a replication proceeding _from_ a specific source bucket _to_ a specific target bucket is returned by specifying the source bucket as the value of `source_or_target_bucket` and appending the replication-identifier `replications/<remote_UUID>/<source_bucket>/<target_bucket>/<statistic_name>` to the URI.
Within the replication-identifier, `remote_UUID` is the universally unique identifier for the reference supporting the replication -- this can be obtained by means of the `GET /pools/default/remoteClusters` method and URI -- see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-get-ref.adoc[Getting a Reference].
The `source_bucket` and `target_bucket` are the source and target buckets for the replication, respectively.
The `statistic_name` is the statistic to be returned.

Note that all elements in the replication-identifier following `replications` must be _encoded_: thus, each forward-slash must be represented as `%2F`.
A list of the values that can be specified as `statistic_name` is provided in xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-statistics.adoc#curl-syntax[Curl Syntax], below.

To return statistics for the source bucket (whether or not the replication-identifier is used), the source cluster's Full Admin, Cluster Admin, XDCR Inbound, or XDCR Admin role is required.
To return statistics for the target bucket, the target cluster's Full Admin, XDCR Admin, or XDCR Inbound role is required.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -u <source-or-target-username>:<source-or-target-password> \
  -X GET http://[ <source-or-target-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091\
  /pools/default/buckets/<source_or_target_bucket>/stats

  curl -u <source-username>:<source-password> \
    -X GET http://<source-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091\
    /pools/default/buckets/<source_bucket>/stats/\
    replications%2F<remote_UUID>%2F<source_bucket>%2F<target_bucket>%2F<statistic_name>
----

If the replication-identifier is _not_ used, and the _target_ cluster's IP address or domain-name is applied, the target cluster's username and password must be provided, and the target bucket must be specified.

The `remote_UUID` is the universally unique identifier for the replication, which is obtained by means of the `GET /pools/default/remoteClusters` method and URI -- see xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-get-ref.adoc[Getting a Reference].

Possible values for `statistic_name` that correspond to the _source_ of a replication are as follows:

[cols="100,223"]
|===
| Statistic | Description

| `bandwidth_usage`
| Bandwidth used during replication, measured in bytes per second.

| `changes_left`
| Number of updates still pending replication.

| `data_replicated`
| Size of data replicated in bytes.

| `docs_checked`
| Number of documents checked for changes.

| `docs_failed_cr_source`
| Number of documents that have failed conflict resolution on the source cluster and not replicated to target cluster.

| `docs_filtered`
| Number of documents that have been filtered out and not replicated to target cluster.

| `docs_opt_repd`
| Number of docs sent optimistically.

| `docs_received_from_dcp`
| Number of documents received from DCP.

| `docs_rep_queue`
| Number of documents in replication queue.

| `docs_processed`
| Number of documents processed by pipeline, since the start or resumption of the current replication.

| `docs_written`
| Number of documents written to the destination cluster, since the start or resumption of the current replication.

| `meta_latency_wt`
| Weighted average time for requesting document metadata.
XDCR uses this for conflict resolution prior to sending the document into the replication queue.

| `num_checkpoints`
| Number of checkpoints issued in replication queue.

| `num_failedckpts`
| Number of checkpoints failed during replication.

| `rate_received_from_dcp`
| Number of documents received from DCP per second.

| `rate_replicated`
| Rate of documents being replicated, measured in documents per second.

| `size_rep_queue`
| Size of replication queue in bytes.

| `time_committing`
| Seconds elapsed during replication.

| `wtavg_docs_latency`
| The average time-period to elapse between
the point at which a document is be ready to be sent from the source to the target,
and the point at which the source receives confirmation from the target that the
document has been received and successfully written.
The average is calculated continuously, from the sum of the elapsed time-periods for the last 1000 documents
to have been sent and acknowledged.

| `wtavg_meta_latency`
| Weighted average time for requesting document metadata.
XDCR uses this for conflict resolution prior to sending the document into the replication queue.
|===

Note that when the target bucket is specified as the value of `source-or-target-bucket`, a variety of statistics for the target are returned.
For XDCR, the most significant is `xdcr_ops`, which indicates numbers of write-operations performed.
All the statistics for the target should be returned, and the values for `xdcr_ops` retrieved from that output.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK` and an object containing information pertaining to the specified statistic, or to all statistics.

Incorrect specification of any element of the replication-identifier returns `200 OK` and an object containing only metadata: no timestamp or node-statistical information is included.
Incorrect specification of the URI returns `404 Object Not Found` and the message `Not found.`
Failure to attempt authentication returns `401 Unauthorized`.
Failure to authenticate correctly returns `403 Forbidden` and the message: `{"message":"Forbidden. User needs the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.bucket[travel-sample].stats!read"]}`.

== Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to return information from a number of statistics.
All use  source and target buckets named `travel_sample` and `ts` respectively.

=== `docs_written`

The following example shows how to return information provided by the `docs_written` statistic.

The output shows that `60` samples were taken.
A sample was taken every `1000` milliseconds, and each sample is represented by its `timestamp`.
1 million documents are shown already to have been written when the first sample was taken; and this number is shown to have remained consistent at the time of each successive sample.

=== Retrieving Incoming Write Operations

The following example returns all the statistics for a target bucket named `testbucket2`.
The IP address is that of the target cluster.

----
curl -u targetUsermane:targetPassword -X GET \
    http://10.5.2.117:8091/pools/default/buckets/testbucket2/stats
----

This returns information on all statistics for `testbucket2`.
To retrieve information on incoming write operations, manually locate the array `xdc_ops`, within the JSON response:
The value for this attribute is the last sampling of write operations on the target cluster.

----
