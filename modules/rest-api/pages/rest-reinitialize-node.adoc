== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /controller/hardResetNode
----

[#description]
== Description

Reinitializes a node, such that all configuration settings and all data are lost.
This HTTP method and URI should be used with caution: a backup of all data on the system is recommended to be performed before reinitialization.

This HTTP method and URI are intended for use subsequent to an _unsafe failover_; which results in multiple failed-over nodes needing reinitialization before they can be added back into the cluster.

The Full Admin role is required.

After its reinitialization, a reinitialized node can be reconfigured.
Note that the call is idempotent, and can be used on the same node multiple times, with the same result.

For detailed information on unsafe failover and its consequences, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/hard-failover.adoc#default-and-unsafe[Hard Failover in Default and Unsafe Modes].
For information on reinitialization, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-init-and-provisioning.adoc[Cluster Initialization and Provisioning].

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/controller/hardResetNode
  -u <username>:<password>
----

The `ip-address-or-domain-name` must be that of the node that is to be reinitialized.
The `username` and `password` must be those of a user with the Full Admin role.

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI returns `404 Object Not Found` with the message `requested resource not found`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example reinitializes node `10.145.250.103`.

----
curl -v -X POST http://10.145.250.103:8091/controller/hardResetNode -u Administrator:password
