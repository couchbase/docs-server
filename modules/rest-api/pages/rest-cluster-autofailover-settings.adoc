== HTTP method and URI

Retrieves auto-failover settings for a cluster.
Auto-failover is a global setting, which applies to all nodes in the cluster.
To read auto-failover settings, appropriate privileges are required.

----
GET /settings/autoFailover
----

Parameters include:

* `enabled`.
Indicates whether automatic failover is enabled (a value of `true`) or disabled (a value of `false`).
* `timeout`.
Returns an integer between 5 and 3600, which specifies the number of seconds set to elapse, after a node has become unavailable, before automatic failover is triggered.
* `count`.
This parameter represents how many sequential auto-failover events have occurred since the parameter was itself last reset, to a value of 0, through administrator intervention.
The parameter's default value is 0.
Couchbase Server increments this value by 1 for every auto-failover event that occurs, up to the _maximum count_ â€” an administrator-specified number whose highest-permitted value is 3.
If sequential auto-failover events occur until the _maximum count_ is reached, no further auto-failover is triggered until a parameter-reset is performed.
