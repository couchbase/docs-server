= Creating a Collection

{description}

== Description

Collections are created by means of the `POST /pools/default/buckets/_<bucket_name>_/scopes/_<scope_name>_/collections` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket_name>/scopes/<scope_name>/collections
----

== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://<hostname-or-ip>:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
    <bucket_name>/scopes/<scope-name>/collections
  -d name=<collection-name>
  -d maxTTL=[integer]
----

The `<bucket-name>` path-parameter specifies the name of the bucket within which the new collection is to reside.
The `<scope-name>` path-parameter provides the name of the scope within which the new collection is to reside.
The `name` parameter specifies the name of the collection to be created: this name cannot subsequently be changed.
The optional `maxTTL` parameter is a period of time in seconds. It defaults to 0. When you set `maxTTL` to value greater than zero (but less than its maximum value of 2147483647), it has the following effects:  

* It sets a default expiration time for documents you create or mutate in the collection. 
* It sets the maximum time in seconds a document can exist before it expires. You can explicitly set a document to expire before this time. Attempting to set a document to expire after this time has Couchbase Server set the document to expire in `maxTTL` seconds.

For more information, see xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
If the collection-name is improperly specified, a notification such as `"name":"Length must be in range from 1 to 30"` or `"name":"Can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the following symbols _ - %"` is displayed.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#naming-for-scopes-and-collections[Naming for Scopes and Collections], for an account of naming conventions.

== Example

The following call creates a collection named `my_collection_in_my_scope`, within an existing scope named `my_scope`, and specifies the default expiration for documents in the collection that's equivalent to two years:

----
curl -X POST -v -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.210.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
testBucket/scopes/my_scope/collections \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_1 \
-d maxTTL=63113904
----

If successful, the call returns a `uid`, such as the following:

----
{"uid":18}
----
