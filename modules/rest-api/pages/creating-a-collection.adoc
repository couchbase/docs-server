= Creating a Collection
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Collections can be _created_ by means of the REST API.

== Description

Collections are created by means of the `POST /pools/default/buckets/_<bucket_name>_/scopes/_<scope_name>_/collections` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket_name>/scopes/<scope_name>/collections
----

== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://<hostname-or-ip>:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
    <bucket_name>/scopes/<scope-name>/collections
  -d name=<collection-name>
  -d maxTTL=[integer]
----

The `<bucket-name>` path-parameter specifies the name of the bucket within which the new collection is to reside.
The `<scope-name>` path-parameter provides the name of the scope within which the new collection is to reside.
The `<collection-name>` parameter specifies the name of the collection to be created.
Optionally, the `maxTTL` flag can be used to specify an expiration value for the collection: the specified value must be an integer representing seconds; with the maximum permissible value being 2147483648 (or 68.096 years).
The default value for `maxTTL` is `0`, which disables TTL for the collection.
For more information, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
If the collection-name is improperly specified, a notification such as `"name":"Length must be in range from 1 to 30"` or `"name":"Can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the following symbols _ - %"` is displayed.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#naming-for-scopes-and-collections[Naming for Scopes and Collections], for an account of naming conventions.

== Example

The following call creates a collection named `my_collection_in_my_scope`, within an existing scope named `my_scope`, and specifies an expiration value in seconds that is equivalent to two years:

----
curl -X POST -v -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.210.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/\
testBucket/scopes/my_scope/collections \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_1 \
-d maxTTL=63113904
----

If successful, the call returns a `uid`, such as the following:

----
{"uid":18}
----
