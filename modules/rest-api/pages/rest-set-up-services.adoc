== Description

Sets up the services for a one-node cluster, as part of its initial provisioning.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl  -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/node/controller/setupServices \
-d services=<list-of-service-names>
----

The `list-of-service-names` must consist of one or more of the following: `kv` (Data Service), `n1ql` (Query Service), `index` (Index Service), `fts` (Search Service),`eventing` (Eventing Service), `cbas` (Analytics Service), `backup` (Backup Service).
Each name must be separated from the following name with a comma.

Each service is allocated a default amount of memory, unless custom allocations have been made.
See xref:rest-api:rest-configure-memory.adoc[Configuring Memory] for information on allocating memory per service, and on the default minimum values per service.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
