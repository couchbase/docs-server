== Description

When a replication is deleted, it stops replication from the source to the destination.
If the replication is re-created the between the same source and destination clusters and buckets, XDCR resumes replication.

== HTTP method and URI

----
DELETE /controller/cancelXDCR/[url_encoded_replication_id]
----

Replication ID is provided in the form of `[UUID]/[local-bucket-name]/[remote-bucket-name]`.
It needs to be URL-encoded before it can be used in the delete replication URL.

== Example

A URL-encoded endpoint is used which contains the unique document ID that references the replication.
The replication can also be deleted via the web console.

Curl request example:

----
curl -u Administrator:password1  \
