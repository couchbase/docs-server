:description: pass:q[To delete an XDCR replication, use the `DELETE /controller/cancelXDCR` HTTP method and URI.]

== Description

When a replication is deleted, it stops replication from the source to the destination.
If the replication is re-created the between the same source and destination clusters and buckets, XDCR resumes replication.

== HTTP method and URI

----
DELETE /controller/cancelXDCR/[replication_id]
----

The `replication_id` must take the form `[UUID]/[local-bucket-name]/[remote-bucket-name]`, and must be URL-encoded.
Note that it can be obtained, in encoded format, by means of the `GET` method and `/pools/default/tasks` endpoint, applied to the _source_ cluster: in the output, the encoded id is provided as the value of the `cancelURI` key.
See xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

== Example

A URL-encoded endpoint is used which contains the unique document ID that references the replication.
The replication can also be deleted via the web console.

Curl request example:
