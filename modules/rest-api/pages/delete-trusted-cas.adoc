== Http Methods and URIs

----
DELETE /pools/default/trustedCAs/<id>
----

[#description]
== Description

Removes from the list of trusted CA certificates for the cluster the certificate with the specified id.
The id can be rerieved by means of the `GET /node/controller/trustedCAs` Http method and URI: see xref:rest-api:get-trusted-cas.adoc[Get Root Certificates].

Removal fails if there is on the cluster at least one node certificate that is directly or indirectly (that is, by means of one or more intermediate certificates) signed by the specified certificate.

Note that this API can be used only on clusters all of whose nodes are running Couchbase Server Version 7.1 or later.
It _cannot_ be used on clusters any of whose nodes are running a version of Couchbase Server prior to 7.1.

Either the Full Admin or the Security Admin role is required.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X DELETE http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/trustedCAs/<id>
 -u <username>:<password>
----

The `id` must be an integer that is the id of the certificate that is to be deleted: this can be retrieved as the value of the `id` key, in the array returned by `GET /node/controller/trustedCAs`.
See xref:rest-api:get-trusted-cas.adoc[Get Root Certificates].

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
If no root certificate corresponding to the specified id can be found, deletion fails with `404 Object Not Found`; and the message `Not found` is displayed.

If an attempt is made to delete a root certificate that has signed a node-certificate that is currently in use, deletion fails with `400 Bad Request`, and an error message such as: `{"errors":{"_":"The CA certificate is in use by the following nodes: 10.144.220.102"}}`.

Failure to authenticate returns `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized`.
Authentication with inadequate credentials returns `403 Forbidden`, and an error message such as: `{"message":"Forbidden. User needs the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.admin.security!write"]}`.

A malformed URI returns `HTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found`.
An incorrect method returns `HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed`.

== Example

The following call removes the certificate whose id is `3` from the list of trusted CA certificates for the cluster:

----
curl -X DELETE http://10.144.220.101:8091/pools/default/trustedCAs/3 -u Administrator:password
----
