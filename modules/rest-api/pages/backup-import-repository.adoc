== Description

Imports into the Backup Service of the host cluster a repository that was previously deleted, but which has continued to exist on disk, in a location accessible by the cluster's Backup-Service nodes.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/cluster/self/repository/import
  -u -u <username>:<password>
  -d <repository-specification>
----

The `username` and `password` must be those of a user with the `Full Admin` role.
The `repository-specification` must be a JSON document that provides the following:

* The id under which the repository was saved to disk.
For example, `quarterHourBackups`.

* The name of the repository.
For example, `5efb4b57-b033-4e84-9671-a35a0ac6dace`.

* The location of the repository.
For example, `/Users/user/Documents/archives/quarterHourRepo`.

Syntactically, the `repository-specification` is as follows:

----
{
  "id": <repository-id>,
  "repo": <repository-name>,
  "archive": <repository-location>
}
----

=== Cloud-Specific Parameters

The following, additional parameters are provided, for defining a repository that uses cloud-based storage:

* `cloud_credential_name`.
A string that is a set of registered credentials for the cloud.
If this is not specified, and cloud-storage is to be accessed, either the `cloud_credentials_key` or the `cloud_credentials_id` must be specified instead.

* `cloud_staging_dir`.
The location to be used as a staging directory.
This _must_ be specified, if cloud storage is to be used.
The location must be directory on the local file system that is large enough to accommodate approximately 10% of the data set that is to be backed up.
A minimum of 50 GB is recommended.
The pathname of the location must be accessible to all nodes in the cluster that are running the Backup Service; but the location itself must be _not_ be shared by NFS or any equivalent protocol.
Instead, the location must be a non-shared directory on the local file system for the node.

* `cloud_credentials_id`.
An ID used to connect to object store.
For AWS, this is the _access key id_.

* `cloud_credentials_key`.
A secret key used to connect to object store.
For AWS, this is the _AWS secret access key_.

* `cloud_region`.
The AWS Region for the repository.
For example, `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`.

* `cloud_endpoint`.
If provided, this overrides the default endpoint used for the cloud provider.

* `cloud_force_path_style`.
When provided, and using S3 or S3 compatible storages, this enforces the _old_ S3 path style.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following call imports into the Backup Service the repository located at `/Users/user/Documents/archives/quarterHourRepo`:

----
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/import \
-u Administrator:password \
-d '{"id":"quarterHourRepo","repo":"5efb4b57-b033-4e84-9671-a35a0ac6dace","archive":"/Users/user/Documents/archives/quarterHourRepo"}'
----

Success returns `200 OK`, and the repository is imported into the Backup Service.

The following call imports into the Backup Service the cloud-based repository located at `s3://my-example-bucket/test_backups`:

----
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/repository/import \
-u Administrator:password -d '{"id":"import_test_repository", "archive":"s3://my-example-bucket/test_backups", "repo":"43842820-7265-412c-aacd-9b8f209ff436", "cloud_staging_dir":"/backups_staging/test_backups_staging",
"cloud_credentials_id":"AKxxx",
"cloud_credentials_key":"sfxxx",
"cloud_region":"us-west-2"
}'
----

Success returns `200 OK`, and the repository is imported into the Backup Service.
