== Description

Bucket deletion is a synchronous operation.
When a cluster has multiple servers, some servers might not be able to delete the bucket within the standard 30 second timeout period.

* If the bucket is deleted on all servers within the standard timeout of 30 seconds, a `200` response code is returned.
* If the bucket is not deleted on all servers within the 30 second timeout, a `500` error code is returned.
* If the bucket is not deleted on all servers and another request is made to delete the bucket, a `404` error code is returned.
* If the bucket is not deleted on all servers and a request is made to create a new bucket with the same name, an error might be returned indicating that the bucket is still being deleted.

WARNING: This operation is data destructive.
The service makes no attempt to double check with the user.
It simply moves forward.
Clients applications performing the delete operation are advised to double check with the end user before sending the request.
