== Performing Certificate Management

Couchbase Server supports the use of x.509 certificates, for clients and servers.
The REST API allows the server certificates to be managed.
Server certificates are of two kinds:

* _Root_ certificates.
At least one root certificate exists for each cluster.
Any number of root certificates can be uploaded: together, these constitute the cluster's _trust store_.
Each root certificate contains the public key of a Certificate Authority (CA).
Programs that wish to interact securely with Couchbase Server must elect to trust the CA referenced by one of its root certificates.

* _Node_ certificates.
A different node certificate is installed on each node in the cluster.
This certificate is _signed_ by a root certificate (or by an intermediate certificate that itself has gained authority from that root certificate), and is itself therefore granted the authority of that root certificate.
Clients that contact the node can determine the identity of the root certificate used in its signing by examining the node certificate, and verifying its signature chain &#8212;  which leads to the responsible root certificate.

A complete overview of certificate management for Couchbase Server is provided in xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].
Examples of certificate creation and deployment are provided in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates].

== The REST API for Certificate Management

The Couchbase Server REST API supports certificate management as follows:

* Root certificates can be uploaded, retrieved, and examined.
See xref:rest-api:load-trusted-cas.adoc[Load Trusted CA Certificates] and xref:rest-api:get-trusted-cas.adoc[Get Trusted CA Certificates]

* The current certificate for a specific node can be uploaded, retrieved, and examined.
See xref:rest-api:upload-retrieve-node-cert.adoc[Upload and Retrieve a Node Certificate].
Additionally, all current node certificates for the cluster can be retrieved and examined: see xref:rest-api:retrieve-all-node-certs.adoc[Retrieve All Node Certificates].
