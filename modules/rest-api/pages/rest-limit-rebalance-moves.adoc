= Limiting Concurrent vBucket Moves
:description: Couchbase Server places a limit on the number of concurrent vBucket moves that can occur during rebalance, applying the limit to every node in the cluster.
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
{description}
This limit can be inspected and reset by means of the REST API.

== HTTP methods and URI

----
GET /settings/rebalance

POST /settings/rebalance
----

[#description]
== Description

These respectively retrieve and establish the setting whereby the number of concurrent vBucket moves that any node can handle during rebalance is limited.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#limiting-vbucket-moves[Limiting vBucket Moves], for detailed information.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET -u <administrator>:<password>
   http://<host>:<port>/settings/rebalance

curl -X POST -u <administrator>:<password>
   http://<host>:<port>/settings/rebalance
   -d rebalanceMovesPerNode=<positive-integer>
----

The `positive-integer` used as the value for the `rebalanceMovesPerNode` parameter must be between `1` and `64` inclusive, with `4` being the default.

[#responses]
== Responses

If successful, `200 OK` is given, and an object containing group-related information is returned.

A malformed URI gives `400 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

If an inappropriate value is specified, the following error-notification is returned: `{"errors":{"rebalanceMovesPerNode":"The value must be in range from 1 to 64"}}`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following example retrieves the current setting for vBucket move limitation:

----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/settings/rebalance
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"rebalanceMovesPerNode":4}
----

This indicates that the current setting is `4`, which is the default.

The following example establishes a new value for the setting:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/settings/rebalance \
-d rebalanceMovesPerNode=12
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"rebalanceMovesPerNode":12}
----

This confirms that the value has been successfully reset to `12`.
