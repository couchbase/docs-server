= Getting Cluster Tasks
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
A list of ongoing cluster tasks can be returned with the `POST /pools/default/tasks` HTTP method and URI.

[#rest-get-cluster-tasks-description]
== Description

Ongoing cluster-tasks are reported with status, id, and additional information.

=== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /pools/default/tasks
----

=== Syntax

----
curl -v -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/tasks
----

== Examples

The following examples demonstrate the output returned in accordance with whether and which cluster tasks are underway.

=== No Tasks Underway

When the cluster has no tasks underway, this information is verified by running the method in the standard way.
Note that the output is piped to the `jq` tool, to enhance readability.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/tasks | jq '.'
----

Output is as follows:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "28452d665fce646c98385fb590a30adc",
    "type": "rebalance",
    "status": "notRunning",
    "statusIsStale": false,
    "masterRequestTimedOut": false
  }
]
----

As a default, the output indicates that no rebalance is underway.


=== Adding a Bucket

When a bucket is being added (in this case, the sample bucket `beer-sample`), status can be returned by entering the method in the standard way, specifying the IP address of the cluster, or `localhost`, as appropriate:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET http://localhost:8091/pools/default/tasks | jq '.'
----

Output is as follows:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "1f05320a7b359e1672ffc8b7ee69a8b5",
    "type": "rebalance",
    "status": "notRunning",
    "statusIsStale": false,
    "masterRequestTimedOut": false
  },
  {
    "status": "running",
    "type": "loadingSampleBucket",
    "bucket": "beer-sample",
    "pid": "<0.24849.21>"
  }
]
----

The output indicates that no rebalance is underway, but that the `loadingSampleBucket` operation is ongoing.


=== Compacting a Buckets

When a bucket is being compacted (in this case, the sample bucket `beer-sample`), status can be returned by entering the method in the standard way:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET http://localhost:8091/pools/default/tasks | jq '.'
----

Output is as follows:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "28452d665fce646c98385fb590a30adc",
    "type": "rebalance",
    "status": "notRunning",
    "statusIsStale": false,
    "masterRequestTimedOut": false
  },
  {
    "cancelURI": "/pools/default/buckets/beer-sample/controller/cancelBucketCompaction",
    "type": "bucket_compaction",
    "recommendedRefreshPeriod": 2,
    "status": "running",
    "bucket": "beer-sample",
    "changesDone": 177,
    "totalChanges": 682,
    "progress": 25
  }
]
----

The output indicates that the `beer-sample` bucket is being compacted.
Progress is reported in terms of `changesDone`, `totalChanges`, and a `progress` figure that is a percentage of total completion.
A URI is provided for cancelling compaction, if required.

=== Rebalance Following Node-Addition

When rebalance is used to eject node `10.143.190.103` from a cluster of three nodes, which has included `10.143.190.101` and `10.143.190.102` in addition to itself, and which is hosting the `travel-sample` and `beer-sample` sample buckets, the progress of the task can be monitored by entering the method in the standard way:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/tasks | jq '.'
----

Depending on exactly when the method is run, the output might be as follows:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "f48ed1db5b4bf75e7bff06b1e59fa397",
    "type": "rebalance",

          }
        },

            "activeVBucketsLeft": 5,

          },
          "outgoing": {
            "docsTotal": 1176,
            "docsTransferred": 1176,
            "activeVBucketsLeft": 0,
            "replicaVBucketsLeft": 5
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
]

----

The response object provides a `statusId` for the ongoing `rebalance` operation.
The value of `progress` indicates that at the time of running the method, overall progress was slightly below `48` percent.
Progress is also give `perNode`: each value is a percentage: note that these values are represented as percentages in Couchbase Web Console, when it is itself used to monitor rebalance.
All progress values are represented as floating-point numbers with fourteen places.
A `detailedProgress` object is also provided for each node, with indications of the status of documents and vBuckets.
Note that at any one time, it indicates which of the buckets is currently being redistributed: in this case, it is `beer-sample`.

Note that a `"recommendedRefreshPeriod` of `0.25` seconds is given.
If the same method is entered subsequently, output indicates that progress continues:

Note that the `travel-sample` bucket is now being redistributed.

==== Rebalance Failure

If rebalance fails, the following response error can be returned, by entering the method in the standard way:

----
[
  {
    "statusId": "1f05321a7b359e1743ffc8b7ee69a8b9",
    "type": "rebalance",
    "status": "notRunning",
    "errorMessage": "Rebalance failed. See logs for detailed reason. You can try rebalance again."
  }
]
