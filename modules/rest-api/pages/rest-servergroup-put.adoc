[#http-method-and-uri]
== HTTP method and URI

----
PUT /pools/default/serverGroups/<:uuid>
----

[#description]
== Description

This renames a server group.
The new name must be unique, across the cluster.
Names cannot be longer than 64 bytes.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X PUT -u <administrator>:<password>
http://<host>:<port>/pools/default/serverGroups/<uuid>
-d name=<newGroupName>
----

As this indicates, the `uuid` of the group to be renamed must be appended to the URI.
The `uuid` can be determined by means of the procedure explained in xref:rest-api:rest-servergroup-get.adoc[Getting Server Group Information].
Note that the group's `uuid` is itself _unchanged_ by the changing of the group's name.

[#responses]
== Responses

Success gives `200 OK`, and returns and empty object.
An incorrectly specified `uuid` gives `404 Object Not Found`, and returns an object of the form `["Could not find group with uuid: <submitted-uuid>"]`.
Specifying a name already assigned to an existing group gives `400 Bad Request`, and returns an object of the form `{"name": "already exists"}`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example assumes that the procedure described in xref:rest-api:rest-servergroup-get.adoc[Getting Server Group Information] has provided output containing the following:

----
"name": "Group 2",
      "uri": "/pools/default/serverGroups/3b66b3c3177f44a3ffa6771ffeb31f36",
----

This indicates that the cluster contains a group named `Group 2`, whose `uuid` is `3b66b3c3177f44a3ffa6771ffeb31f36`.

Therefore, by specifying `3b66b3c3177f44a3ffa6771ffeb31f36`, the following request changes the name of `Group 2` to `Group X`:

----
curl -X PUT -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/serverGroups/\
3b66b3c3177f44a3ffa6771ffeb31f36 \
-d 'name="Group X"'
----
