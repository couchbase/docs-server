== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/rebalanceProgress
----

[#rest-cluster-rebalance-description]
== Description

When one or more nodes have been brought into a cluster, or have been taken out of a cluster, _rebalance_ is used to redistribute data and indexes among available nodes.
The ongoing progress of the rebalance operation can be retrieved.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/rebalanceProgress
----

== Response

Success gives the response code `200 OK`, and returns an object containing information on the current status of the ongoing rebalance.
See the examples provided below.

== Examples

In the following example, node `10.143.190.103` has been added to a cluster of two nodes, which are `10.143.190.101` and `10.143.190.102`.
Rebalance is then initiated.
During rebalance, progress is ascertained by means of the `POST /pools/default/rebalanceProgress` HTTP method and URI, with output being piped to the tool `jq`, to ensure readability.

----
curl -u Administrator:password -v -X GET 10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/rebalanceProgress | jq '.'
----

On success, the response code `200 OK` is given, and the following object is returned:

----
{
  "status": "running",
  "ns_1@10.143.190.101": {
    "progress": 0.1103515625
  },
  "ns_1@10.143.190.102": {
    "progress": 0.1095890410958904
  },
  "ns_1@10.143.190.103": {
    "progress": 0.3299120234604106
  }
}
----

The output thus features `progress`, specified as a ten-place floating-point number, for each of the three nodes.
(Note that if Couchbase Web Console is simultaneously used to monitor the rebalance, these decimals are represented as _11.0%_, _10.9%_, and _32.9%_ respectively.
See the example provided in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#rebalance-progress-add-node[Add a Node with the UI].)

When rebalance has concluded, re-running the method returns the response code `200 OK`, and the following object:

----
{
  "status": "none"
}
----
