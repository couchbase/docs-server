== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /cluster/self/repository/< "active" | "imported" | "archived" >/<repository-id>/examine
----

[#description]
== Description

Retrieves instances of a document from a subset of backups within a repository.
The repository can be active, imported, or archived.
The document-key and bucket (optionally with scope and collection) must be specified as a JSON payload.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/cluster/self\
/repository/< "active" | "imported" | "archived" >/<repository-id>/examine \
  -u <username>:<password>
  -d <document-search-specification>
----

The `username` and `password` must identify an administrator with the Full Admin role.
The `repository-id` must be the name of a repository that is active, imported, or archived, depending on the specification made by the preceding path-parameter.
The `document-search-specification` must be a JSON document that specifies the following:

* The _key_ of a document.

* A _data path_.
The bucket, scope, and collection within which the document resides.
The names must be specified in order of containment, period-separated: for example, `travel-sample._default._default`.

Syntactically therefore, the `document-search-specification` should be as follows:

----
{
  "key": <document-key>,
  "data_path": < bucket-name.scope-name.collection-name >
}
----

[#responses]
== Responses

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and a series of documents, each being a backed up instance of that sought for by its key.
If the specified repository cannot be found, `404 Object No Found` is returned.
If an internal error prevents successful execution, `500` is returned.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example is used to examine instances of the document whose key is `airline_10`, within the default scope and collection of the `travel-sample` bucket, in the active repository `hourlyBackupRepo`.

----
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/active/hourlyBackupRepo/examine \
-u Administrator:password \
-d '{"key": "airline_10","data_path":"travel-sample._default._default"}'
----

On success, the call returns the following:

----
{
  "backup": "2020-09-11T16_30_10.894277+01_00",
  "sequence_number": 500,
  "key": "airline_10",
  "value": {
    "callsign": "MILE-AIR",
    "country": "United States",
    "iata": "Q5",
    "icao": "MLA",
    "id": 10,
    "name": "40-Mile Air",
    "type": "airline"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "flags": 33554438,
    "expiry": 0,
    "locktime": 0,
    "cas": 1598358036122239000,
    "revseqno": 2,
    "datatype": 3
  },
  "deleted": false
}
{
  "backup": "2020-09-14T17_00_55.976325+01_00",
  "sequence_number": 501,
  "key": "airline_10",
  "value": {
    "callsign": "MILE-AIR",
    "country": "United States",
    "iata": "Q6",
    "icao": "MLA",
    "id": 11,
    "name": "40-Mile Air",
    "type": "airline"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "flags": 33554438,
    "expiry": 0,
    "locktime": 0,
    "cas": 1600097937324376000,
    "revseqno": 3,
    "datatype": 3
  },
  "deleted": false
}
----

Thus, each object returns contains the id of the backup within which the document-instance resides, the sequence number of the document-instance, and the data and metadata values of the instance.
