== HTTP Methods and URIs

----
GET /pools/default/buckets

GET /pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>
----

[#description]
== Description

`GET /pools/default/buckets` retrieves information on all buckets defined on the cluster.
If the `<bucket-name>` path-parameter is added, only information on the specified bucket is retrieved.


[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X GET http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>
----

[#responses]
== Responses

Successful execution returns `200 OK`, and either an object containing information on the individual bucket specified by the path-parameter; or an array of such objects, each containing information on one of the buckets defined on the cluster.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.
If an internal error prevents successful execution, `500 Internal Server Error` is returned.

[#example]
== Example

The following example returns information on a single bucket named `travel-sample`.
The output of the call is piped to https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] to improve readability.

----
curl -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample | jq '.'
----

If successful, the call returns `200 OK`, and an object similar to the one shown in the following example.

NOTE: The output contains an extensive array of vBucket data that is omitted from this example.

The fields `historyRetentionCollectionDefault`, `historyRetentionCollectionBytes`, and `historyRetentionCollectionSeconds` are specific to Magma storage. 
When the bucket does not use Magma as its storage backend, these properties do not appear in the output.

NOTE: Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 added a property named `enableCrossClusterVersioning` to support a future feature. 
Do not change the value of this field. 
Once enabled, you cannot turn it off.
