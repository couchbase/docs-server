= Adding Nodes to Groups
:description: pass:q[A node can be added to the cluster and simultaneously added to an existing server group with the `POST /pools/default/serverGroups/<:uuid>/addNode` HTTP method and URI.]

== HTTP method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/serverGroups/<:uuid>/addNode

[#description]
== Description

This adds a node to a cluster, and assigns it to the specified group.
Optionally, it assigns services to the node.
These can be `kv` (Data), `index` (Index), `n1ql` (Query), `eventing` (Eventing), `fts` (Search), or `cbas` (Analytics).
If none is specified, the Data Service is assigned by default.

For a conceptual overview of nodes, and of the process of adding nodes to clusters, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc[Nodes].
In particular, note that the node to be added needs only to have been installed and started.
If it has been _initialized_, data-paths so established will be retained, following addition.
However, if the node to be added has been _provisioned_, all results of that provisioning will be deleted by the addition-process.
This includes services, memory-quotas, buckets, bucket-data, and all established usernames and passwords.

Following successful addition, rebalance is required.
For a conceptual overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc[Rebalance].
For examples of performing rebalance, see xref:rest-api:rest-cluster-rebalance.adoc[Rebalancing Nodes].

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST -d hostname=<host>:<port>
  -d services=<kv|index|n1ql|fts|cbas|eventing>
  -d user=<administrator>
  -d password=<password>
  -u <administrator>:<password>
  http://<host>:<port>/pools/default/serverGroups/<uuid>/addNode
----

The syntax includes the following:

* `hostname`.
The hostname and port of the node to be added.

* `user` and `password`.
The username and password for the node to be added.
If the node has not yet been provisioned, placeholder username and password should be specified.

* `uuid`.
This path-parameter identifies the server group to which the node is to be assigned.
To retrieve this prior to node-addition, use the procedure described in xref:rest-api:rest-servergroup-get.adoc[Getting Server Group Information].

[#responses]
== Responses
Success gives `200 OK`, and returns an object signifying that the nodes specified for addition has been duly added to the cluster (see the example given below).
An incorrectly specified `uuid` gives `404 Object Not Found`, and returns an object of the form `["Could not find group with uuid: <submitted-uuid>"]`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
Failure to specify username and password for the node to be added gives `400 Bad Request`, and returns an object of the form `["user is missing","password is missing"]`.

[#example]
== Example

The following example assumes that the cluster has two groups,
`Group 1` and `Group 2`.
The `uuid` for `Group 2` has been returned as `246b5de857e100dbfd8b6dee0406420a`.
The following request therefore adds a new node, `10.143.190.104` to the cluster, and assigns it to `Group 2`.
The Data and Index Services are deployed to the new node.

----
curl -X POST -d hostname=10.143.190.104:8091 \
-d services=kv%2Cindex \
-d user=Administrator -d password=password \
-u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.190.101:8091/pools/default/serverGroups/\
3b66b3c3177f44a3ffa6771ffeb31f36/addNode
----

If successful, the request returns the following object, which indicates that the new node has been added to the cluster:

----
{"otpNode":"ns_1@10.143.190.104"}
----
