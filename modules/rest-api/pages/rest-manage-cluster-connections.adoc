== HTTP Methods and URIs

----
POST /pools/default/settings/memcached/global

GET /pools/default/settings/memcached/global
----

== Description

A Couchbase-Server cluster allows connections to be established, both for memcached and for authenticated system-users.
In each case, a maximum permitted number of connections can be established for the cluster, and can be retrieved.

The Full Admin or Cluster Admin role is required.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -u <username>:<password> -X POST
  <ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global
  -d max_connections=<integer>
  -d system_connections=<integer>
  -d connection_limit_mode=[ disconnect | recycle ]
  -d free_connection_pool_size=<integer>

curl -u <username>:<password> -X GET
  <ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global
----

The `integer` specified as the value for `max_connections` determines the maximum number of connections that can be established by memcached for the cluster.
The smallest value acceptable for `max_connections` is `2000`.
The `integer` specified as the value for `system_connections` determines the maximum number of connections that can be established by authenticated system-users for the cluster.
The smallest value acceptable for `system_connections` is `1000`.

The value of `connection_limit_mode` can be either:

* `disconnect`.
When the maximum number of connections for authenticated system-users (as specified by the value of `system_connections`) has been reached, each new attempted connection is dropped.
This is the default.

* `recycle`.
When the maximum number of connections for authenticated system-users (as specified by the value of `system_connections`) has been reached, each new attempted connection is accepted, and one or more existing, stale connections is dropped.

The value of the optional `free_connection_pool_size` parameter must be an integer: this specifies the number of free connections that should be maintained for the cluster, to ensure that new connections can be immediately accepted when `connection_limit_mode` is specified as `recycle`.
If no value is specified for `free_connection_pool_size`, the value defaults to 1% of the value specified for `system_connections`.

== Responses

Successful use of GET returns `200 OK`, and an object containing a key-value pair for each established setting.

Successful use of POST returns `202 Accepted`, and an object containing a key-value pair for any established setting.

A malformed URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
Successful authentication with an inappropriate role returns `403 Forbidden`, and an object such as the following: `{"message":"Forbidden. User needs the following permissions","permissions":["cluster.admin.memcached!read"]}`.

Specifying, in a POST, an `integer` whose size is excessive for the environment returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object such as the following: `{"system_connections":"too_large"}`.
Likewise, specifying an integer whose size is insufficient returns `400 Bad Request`, and an object such as the following: `{"max_connections":"too_small"}`.

== Examples

The following example sets the maximum number of connections for authenticated system-users to `50000`:

----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global \
-d system_connections=50000 \
-u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"system_connections":50000}
----

The following example sets the maximum number of connections for memcached to `650000`:

----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global \
-u Administrator:password \
-d max_connections=650000
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"max_connections":650000,"system_connections":50000}
----

The returned object thus indicates that both `max_connections` and `system_connections` have now been set.

The following example returns the current settings for the cluster:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"max_connections":650000,"system_connections":50000}
----

The following example establishes maximum numbers for memcached and system connections as `650000` and `750000` respectively.
It also specifies the value of `connection_limit_mode` as `recycle`, to ensure that new connections are accepted; and specifies a `free_connection_pool_size` of `10000`.

----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/global \
-d free_connection_pool_size=10000 \
-u Administrator:password \
-d connection_limit_mode=recycle \
-d system_connections=750000 \
-d max_connections=650000
----

If successful, the call returns an object such as the following:

----
{"max_connections":650000,"system_connections":750000,"connection_limit_mode":"recycle","free_connection_pool_size":10000}
----
