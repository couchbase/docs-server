== HTTP method and URIs

----
GET /events

GET /eventsStreaming
----

[#rest-getting-system-events-description]
== Description

The `events` URI returns previously logged system events.
The `eventsStreaming` URI returns previously logged system events as an array; and then streams all further system events as they occur.

Either the Full or the Cluster Admin role is required.


== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X GET -u [username]:[password]
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/events?sinceTime=<time-value>&limit=<limit-value>

curl -v -X GET -u [username]:[password]
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/eventsStreaming
----

The `sinceTime` path-parameter specifies the time (inclusive) from which previously logged events are to be returned.
The associated `time-value` must be specified in _ISO 8601 UTC_ format &#8212; which is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`.
If this path-parameter is not used, logs starting from the oldest are returned.
Note that system events are stored in a log file by the Cluster Manager, and are replicated to each individual node.
Delays in replication may result in some system events being omitted from the results returned from the node specified in the call.
Note also that the maximum size of each event log is 10K: logs are rotated (in memory and on disk) when this limit is reached: events not in the current log cannot be returned.

The `limit` path-parameter specifies the maximum number of logged events to be returned.
The default `limit-value` is `250`.
If `limit-value` is specified as `-1`, no limit is imposed; and all events logged since the specified `sinceTime`, or from the oldest logged event, are therefore returned.

== Responses

Success gives the response code `200 OK`.
A malformed URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

== Examples

The following examples show how to use the calls.

=== Return Previously Logged Events

The following call returns events logged since 10:36 am on January 4th, 2022 &#8212; specifying a maximum of two.
The output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^] program, to facilitate readability.

----
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8091/events?sinceTime=2022-01-04T10:36:00Z&limit=2' -u Administrator:password | jq

----

If successful, the call returns output such as the following:

----
{
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2022-01-05T11:30:48.265Z",
      "uuid": "11a03d9d-cc1c-c402-37ec-4e48abdd69b9",
      "event_id": 10243,
      "component": "views",
      "description": "view engine settings changed",
      "severity": "info",
      "extra_attributes": {
        "section": "security",
        "key": "audit",
        "old_value": "undefined",
        "new_value": "[{audit_enabled,false},{disabled_users,[]},{enabled_events,[]}]"
      },
      "node": "cb.local",
      "otp_node": "ns_1@cb.local"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2022-01-05T11:30:48.279Z",
      "uuid": "a24057ac-b4a8-8b82-d1b0-0a380be41344",
      "event_id": 10243,
      "component": "views",
      "description": "view engine settings changed",
      "severity": "info",
      "extra_attributes": {
        "section": "httpd",
        "key": "extra_headers",
        "old_value": "undefined",
        "new_value": "[{\"X-Content-Type-Options\",\"nosniff\"},\n {\"X-Frame-Options\",\"DENY\"},\n {\"X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies\",\"none\"},\n {\"X-XSS-Protection\",\"1; mode=block\"}]"
      },
      "node": "cb.local",
      "otp_node": "ns_1@cb.local"
    }
  ]
}

=== Return a Stream of Ongoing Events

The following call returns all previously logged system events that are held in the event log; then, it starts a stream of system events, which are displayed on the console as they occur on the cluster:

----
curl -v -X GET localhost:8091/eventsStreaming -u Administrator:password
----

If successful, the call initially returns an array of previously logged system events:

----
[{"timestamp":"2021-11-30T09:35:58.536Z","uuid":"0cc06643-4aa9-c8e1-7488-9cee65eadcbd","event_id":10243,"component":"views","description":"view engine settings changed","severity":"info","extra_attributes":{"section":"security","key":"audit","old_value":"undefined","new_value":"[{audit_enabled,false},{disabled_users,[]},{enabled_events,[]}]"}, . . .

                                                      . . . "node":"10.144.220.101"}]
----

Subsequently, events are displayed on the console as they occur.
For example, triggering a rebalance results in the following information displayed to the console:

----
[{"timestamp":"2022-01-04T12:54:47.072Z","event_id":2,"component":"ns_server","description":"Rebalance initiated","severity":"info","node":"10.144.220.101","uuid":"828b9993-ed40-4196-b779-3f2aa4440b7e","extra_attributes":{"operation_id":"87ded2912711c9452db360197c15bc80","nodes_info":{"active_nodes":["ns_1@10.144.220.101","ns_1@10.144.220.102"],"keep_nodes":["ns_1@10.144.220.101","ns_1@10.144.220.102"],"eject_nodes":[],"delta_nodes":[],"failed_nodes":[]}}},{"timestamp":"2022-01-04T12:54:48.521Z","event_id":3,"component":"ns_server","description":"Rebalance completed","severity":"info","node":"10.144.220.101","uuid":"7b3d6236-71b8-431b-8ac6-39c443e9a628","extra_attributes":{"operation_id":"87ded2912711c9452db360197c15bc80","nodes_info":{"active_nodes":["ns_1@10.144.220.101","ns_1@10.144.220.102"],"keep_nodes":["ns_1@10.144.220.101","ns_1@10.144.220.102"],"eject_nodes":[],"delta_nodes":[],"failed_nodes":[]},"time_taken":1440,"completion_message":"Rebalance completed successfully."}}]
