{description}

== Description
Scopes are created by means of the `POST /pools/default/buckets/_<bucket_name>_/scopes/` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /pools/default/buckets/<bucket_name>/scopes
----

== Curl Syntax

The curl syntax is as follows:

----
curl -X POST -v -u [admin]:[password]
  http://<hostname-or-ip>:8091/pools/default/buckets/<bucket-name>/scopes
  -d name=<scope-name>
----

The `<bucket-name>` path-parameter specifies the bucket within which the new scope is to be created.
The `scope-name` parameter specifies the name of the scope to be created.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.
A malformed URI fails with `404 Object Not Found`.
If the scope-name is improperly specified, a notification such as `"name":"Length must be in range from 1 to 30"` or `"name":"Can only contain characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and the following symbols _ - %"` is displayed.
See xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc#naming-for-scopes-and-collections[Naming for Scopes and Collections], for an account of naming conventions.

== Example

The following call creates a scope named `my_scope` in the bucket `testBucket`:

----
curl -X POST -v -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.210.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/scopes \
-d name=my_scope
----

If successful, the call returns a `uid`, such as the following:

----
{"uid":17}
----
