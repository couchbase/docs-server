:description: The REST API allows cluster-statistics to be retrieved for multiple metrics, in a single call.

[#description]
== Description

This method and URI allow cluster-statistics to be retrieved, based on the specification of one or more _metrics_.
Statistics can be further defined through the specifying of _functions_; and/or _labels_ with values.
Metrics, functions, labels, and values are expressed as an array of JSON objects; which is provided as data accompanying the call.

An instance of _Prometheus_ runs on each node of the cluster; and the metrics for each node are duly stored in that node's instance of Prometheus.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST /pools/default/stats/range
 -d [ <data> ]
----

Each `data` object within the array can contain the following parameters:

----
{
  "metric": [
      [ <metric-specification> ],
      "applyFunctions": [ <function> ],
      "nodes": [ <node> ],
      "aggregationFunction": <function>,
      "start": <start_timestamp>,
      "end":  <end_timestmamp>,
      "step": <step>,
      "timeout": <timeout>,
      "alignTimestamps": true | false
  ]
}
----

The parameters are as follows:

* One or more `metric-specification` objects must be provided as an array.
Each object takes the following form:

----
{
  "label": <label_name>,
  "value": <label_val>,
  "operator": "=" | "!=" | "=~" | "~="
}
----

The value of the key `label`, `label_name`, must be a string that specifies how the metric is identified: for example, `name`, or `proc`.
The value of the key `value`, `label_val`, must be a string that is the actual name used to identify the metric: for example, `sys_cpu_utilization_rate`.
The value of the key `"operator"` must be `=`, `!=`, `=~`, or `~=`.

* `applyFunctions.`
Can be any of the functions described in the section xref:rest-api:rest-statistics-single.adoc#function[function], on the page xref:rest-api:rest-statistics-single.adoc[Getting a Single Statistic].

* `nodes`.
An array each of whose elements is a string whose value is the IP address or domain name of a node in the cluster.
If this is not specified, the default is that all nodes are inferred.

* `aggregationFunction`.
Whether and how aggregation of retrieved statistics is to be performed.
Possible values are `max`, `min`, `sum`, and `avg`.
The default is that no aggregation is performed.

* `start`.
The point at which the gathering of metrics commences, specified in seconds as a negative integer.
The negative integer-value is added to the current time when execution occurs, so as to derive a historic timestamp.
Metrics are then gathered for the time-period that starts at the historic timestamp.
If no `start` value is specified, it defaults to `-60`.
If no `end` value is specified, it defaults to the time of execution.

* `end`.
The point at which the gathering of metrics concludes, specified in seconds as a negative integer.
The negative integer-value is added to the current time when execution occurs, so as to derive a historic timestamp.
Metrics are then gathered for the time-period that starts at the historic timestamp specified for `start`, and ends at the historic timestamp specified for `end`.
If no `end` value is specified, it defaults to the time of execution.

* `step`.
The length of the interval that occurs between each statistic-retrieval during the time-period that commences with `start` and concludes with `end`, specified as a positive integer.
For example, if `start` is `-100`, `end` is `-40`, and `step` is `15`, a statistic is gathered at `-100`. `-85`, `-70`, `-55`, and `-40`.
If no value is specified for `step`, it defaults to `10`.

* `timeout`.
The period after which execution times out, in milliseconds.
The default is `5` minutes.

* `alignTimestamps`.
Whether to align timestamps so that each is a multiple of `10` milliseconds.
The value can be `true` or `false` (which is the default).
For example, if the value is `false`, consecutive timestamps might be `1617274978`, `1617274988`, and `1617274998`; whereas if the value is `true`, they might be `1617275000`, `1617275010`, and `1617275020`.

[#responses]
== Responses

A malformed URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
If an internal error causes the call the fail, `500` is returned.

If the URI is correct, and authentication succeeds, the operation is deemd successful.
Success returns `200 OK`, and an object of the following kind.
Note that incorrect specification of `metric-name` or `function-expression` does not produce execution-failure: indications of errors appear in the returned object.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following example returns information on the metrics `sysproc_cpu_utilization` (specifying the `indexer` process) and `kv_disk_write_queue` (specifying the `travel-sample` bucket).
Note that the example uses https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^], to format the output for readability:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST http://10.144.210.101:8091/pools/default/stats/range \
-d '[
  {
    "metric": [
      {"label": "name", "value": "sysproc_cpu_utilization"},
      {"label": "proc", "value": "indexer"}
    ],
    "applyFunctions": ["avg"],
    "alignTimestamps": true,
    "step": 15,
    "start": -60
  },
  {
    "metric": [
      {"label": "name", "value": "kv_disk_write_queue"},
      {"label": "bucket", "value": "travel-sample"}
    ],
    "applyFunctions": ["sum"],
    "step": 60,
    "start": -300
  }
]' | jq '.'
----

If successful, this call returns a JSON array such as the following:

----
[
  {
    "data": [
      {
        "metric": {
          "nodes": [

            "3"
          ],
          [
            1623745215,
            "3"
          ],
          [

        ]
      }
    ],

          ],
          "name": "kv_disk_write_queue"
        },
        "values": [
          [
            1623745200,
