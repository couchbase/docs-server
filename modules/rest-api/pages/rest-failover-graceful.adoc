== HTTP method and URI

Initiates graceful failover for a specific server node.
The server node is specified with the `otpNode=[node@hostname]` parameter.

----
POST /controller/startGracefulFailover
----

NOTE: The failover progress can be tracked just like rebalance.
After the data is persisted to disk and replicas are up-to-date, the node is put into the failed over state.

== Syntax

----
POST /controller/startGracefulFailover
    otpNode=[node@hostname]
----

NOTE: Be sure to update any scripts that implement failover.

== Example

Curl request example:

----
curl -u Administrator:password -d 'otpNode=ns_1@10.5.2.118' \
http://10.5.2.54:8091/controller/startGracefulFailover
