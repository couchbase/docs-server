= Performing Compaction Manually
:page-topic-type: reference

[abstract]
Couchbase Server allows a bucket's data to be compacted manually.

== Description

Couchbase Server allows a specified bucket's data to be compacted by the administrator, manually.
_Full Admin_ and _Cluster Admin_ permissions are required.

== HTTP methods and URIs

The following methods and URIs allow explicit initiation and cancellation of data-compaction for a specified bucket:

----
POST /pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]/controller/compactBucket

POST /pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]/controller/cancelBucketCompaction
----

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -i -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]/controller/compactBucket

curl -i -X POST -u [admin]:[password]
  http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default/buckets/[bucket-name]/controller/cancelBucketCompaction
----

== Responses

If the call is successful, `200 OK` is given, and an object containing group-related information is returned.
An incorrectly specified bucket-name or URI gives `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to authenticate gives `401 Unauthorized`.

== Example

The following example performs compaction on the bucket `travel-sample`:

----
curl -i -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.193.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/controller/compactBucket
----

Once initiated, the compaction-process can be terminated, with a call such as the following:

----
curl -i -v -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.193.101:8091/pools/default/buckets/travel-sample/controller/cancelBucketCompaction
----
