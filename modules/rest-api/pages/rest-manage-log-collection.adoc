== Description

The Couchbase-Server _Logging_ facility records important events, and saves the details to log files, on disk.
On each node within a Couchbase-Server cluster, logging is performed continuously.
Logged information can be collected either from all or from selected nodes within the cluster.

The `POST /controller/startLogsCollection` method and endpoint start the collection of Couchbase-Server log files.
The `POST /controller/cancelLogsCollection` method and endpoint can be used to cancel collection, once it has been started.
The `GET /pools/default/tasks` method and endpoint, which are fully described in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks], can be used to return status on ongoing tasks, including the collection of log files.

Both `POST /controller/startLogsCollection` and `POST /controller/cancelLogsCollection` require either the *Full Admin* or the *Cluster Admin* role.

[#log-file-locations]
=== Log-File Locations

By default, on Linux systems, log files are saved to `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; on MacOS, to `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`; and on Windows, to `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs`.

== Curl Syntax

[source,bourne]
----
curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/controller/startLogsCollection
-u <username>:<password>
-d nodes=[ '*' | <node-list> ]
-d logRedactionLevel=[ 'partial' | 'none' ]
-d logDir=<pathname>
-d tmpDir=<pathname>
-d logRedactionSalt=<string>
-d uploadHost=<upload-host-name>
-d uploadProxy=<upload-proxy-name>
-d customer=<customer-name>
-d ticket=<ticket-number>

curl -X POST http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/controller/cancelLogsCollection
-u <username>:<password>
----

For the curl syntax for `GET /pools/default/tasks`, see xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

Parameters for `POST /controller/startLogsCollection` are as follows:

* `nodes`. Either a (quoted) wildcard character, `'*'`, indicating that logs are to be collected for all nodes in the cluster; or a list of nodes for which logs are to be collected.
If a list is specified, each element in the list must be comma-separated from the element that follows it; and each element must take the following form:
+
[source,bourne]
----
ns_1@<ip-address-or-domain-name>
----
+
After log-collection has started, if `POST /controller/cancelLogsCollection` is executed, log-collection is stopped on all nodes that were specified by means of the `nodes` flag.

* `logRedactionLevel`.
The redaction-level for the logs.
This must be either `none` (the default) or `partial`.
If `partial` is specified, data such as usernames, keys, and values are redacted from the logs.

* `logDir`.
The pathname of the directory on each node into which logs are written.
Each node must have this pathname.
If a node does not have the pathname, or if the directory has insufficient space, or if the directory is not accessible by user `couchbase`, log-collection fails for that node.

* `tmpDir`.
The pathname of the directory on each node into which temporary files are written, during log-collection.
If a node does not have the pathname, the operating system's temporary directory is used instead.
If the administrator-specified directory has insufficient space, or if the directory is not accessible by user `couchbase`, log-collection fails for that node.

* `logRedactionSalt`.
Used optionally, to specify a string to be used as the salt, when `partial` redaction is specified; so as to increase redaction-security.
If no salt is specified, a salt is automatically generated and applied by Couchbase Server.

* `upload-host`.
Used optionally, to specify, as a URL, the name of the host to which the zip file containing the collected logs is to be uploaded.

* `upload-proxy`.
Specifies a proxy that can be used for upload; in cases where the cluster has been deployed in a secure environment, and so does not have a direct, outbound connection to the internet.

* `customer`.
Used optionally, to specify a `customer-name` that is the name of the customer uploading logs.

* `ticket`.
Used optionally, to specify a `ticket-number` that corresponds to a ticket created by Couchbase Support to track the issue in connection with which logs are being uploaded.

[#responses]
== Responses

On success, both `POST /controller/startLogsCollection` and `POST /controller/cancelLogsCollection` return `200 OK`; and an empty array.

Status on an ongoing log-collection, including reports of failure, can be accessed by means of `GET /pools/default/tasks`.
For example, starting log-collection with an inaccessible `output` directory returns `200 OK`: however, subsequent use of `GET /pools/default/tasks` returns output containing the following:

[source,bourne]
----
"perNode": {
      "ns_1@10.144.231.101": {
        "status": "failed",
        "collectionStatusCode": "1",
        "collectionOutput": "do not have write access to the directory /home/vagrant/output2\n"
      },
          .
          .
          .
----

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
Specifying an incorrect URL returns `404 Object Not Found`.
An attempt to start log-collection while log-collection is already underway returns `400 Bad Request` and an error message such as `{"_":"Logs collection task is already started"}`.

An attempt to start log-collection while specifying an unknown node returns `400 Bad Request` and an error message such as `{"nodes":"Unknown nodes: [\"ns_1@10.144.231.105\"]"}`.

[#examples]
== Examples

The following example starts log-collection for three, explicitly specified cluster-nodes.
It also specifies that partial redaction be used, and provides a salt.
Additionally, it specifies an upload-host, a customer-name, and a ticket-number.

[source,bourne]
----
curl -X POST http://10.144.231.101:8091/controller/startLogsCollection \
-u Administrator:password \
-d nodes=ns_1@10.144.231.101,ns_1@10.144.231.102,ns_1@10.144.231.103 \
-d logRedactionLevel=partial \
-d logDir=/home/vagrant/output \
-d tmpDir=/home/vagrant/tmp \
-d logRedactionSalt=hello \
-d uploadHost=couchbase.com \
-d customer=joe \
-d ticket=1234
----

Success returns an empty array. Progress can be checked as follows.
Note that this example uses https://jqlang.github.io/jq/[jq^], to facilitate output-readability:

----
curl -X GET http://10.144.231.101:8091/pools/default/tasks -u Administrator:password  | jq
----

If successful, the call returns output such as the following:

  }
]
----

In the above output, a `clusterLogsCollection` task executed on node `ns_1@10.144.231.101` is shown to have three `perNode` activities.
The status for each is displayed as `started`, and the `path` of the output file is shown.
The `cancelURI` for the task is also provided.

The following call is used to cancel the ongoing log-collection:

[source,bourne]
----
curl -X POST http://10.144.231.101:8091/controller/cancelLogsCollection -u Administrator:password
----

Success returns an empty array.
Results can be checked by a further use of `GET /pools/default/tasks`.
Output is as follows:

[source,bourne]

    "statusIsStale": false,

      },
      "ns_1@10.144.231.102": {

    "progress": 100,
    "ts": "2023-06-06 14:07:35",
    "status": "cancelled"
  }
]
----

The above output shows that the `status` of each activity is `failed`; and that of the overall task is `cancelled`.
