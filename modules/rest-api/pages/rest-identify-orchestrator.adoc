= Identifying the Orchestrator Node

[abstract]
The node currently running the _orchestrator_ (sometimes referred to as the _Master Services_) can be identified by means of the REST API.

== HTTP Method and URI

----
GET /pools/default/terseClusterInfo
----

== Description

The _orchestrator_ handles operations with cluster-wide impact; such as failover, rebalance, and adding and deleting buckets.
Every Couchbase-Server node contains an instance of the orchestrator.
However, at any given time, on a multi-node cluster, only one instance of the orchestrator, on one particular node, is active; and thereby responsible for performing _all_ the cluster-wide operations.
If a hitherto active instance becomes unavailable, another instance, on another node, takes over.

The `GET /pools/default/terseClusterInfo` http method and URI identify the node on which the active orchestrator currently resides.

For more information on the orchestrator and the cluster manager, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager].

This http method and URI are available in Couchbase Server Version 6.6.1 and later.

== Curl Syntax

----
curl -v -X POST -u <username>:<password>
  http://<ip-address-or-domain-name>:8091/pools/default/terseClusterInfo
----

The `ip-address-or-domain-name` should specify a node within the cluster whose orchestrator-location is to be determined: information returned by the call is that which is _known to the specified node_.
The `username` and `password` must be those of a user with the Full Admin, Cluster Admin, Read Only Admin, or Security Admin role.

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`, and an object that contains the following key-value pairs:

* `clusterUUID`.
The universally unique identifier of the cluster whose orchestrator-node is being returned.

* `orchestrator`.
A reference to the node on which the orchestrator is believed, by the specified node, to be running at the time the call is executed.
This value is `"undefined"` if, for any reason, the specified node is unaware of the orchestrator-location.
In particular, if the orchestrator node is rebalanced out, the value of this attribute will be `"undefined"` during the time-period that starts immediately after the node is rebalanced out, and lasts until a new orchestrator is elected: this period is _10 seconds_ in duration.
+
Note that the location of the orchestrator may change at any time, including at a point subsequent to execution of the call but prior to the return of a value; meaning that the returned value is already incorrect.
Note also that in cases where the cluster has undergone an unexpected network partition, different specified nodes may return different values.

* `isBalanced`.
The value is `true` if the specified node believes that data is distributed evenly, topology-aware services are in balance, and no rebalance is required.
Otherwise, the value is `false`.

* `clusterCompatVersion`.
The minimum Couchbase-Server _compatibilty version_ for the cluster.
For example, if a cluster of ten nodes has eight running Couchbase Server Version 6.6, and two running 6.0, the returned `clusterCompatVersion` value is `"6.0"`.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.

== Example

The following example returns the orchestrator-location for a cluster that includes a node whose IP address is `10.143.210.102`.
Note that the output is piped to the https://stedolan.github.io/jq[jq^] command, to facilitate readability:

----
curl -v -X GET -u Administrator:password \
http://10.143.210.102:8091/pools/default/terseClusterInfo | jq '.'
----

If the call is successful, `200 OK` is returned, with the following output:

----
{
  "clusterUUID": "21d1c9a5d1f40f5bb8ac73f6df9db8a7",
  "orchestrator": "ns_1@10.143.210.101",
  "isBalanced": true,
  "clusterCompatVersion": "6.6"
}
----

The output thus provides the UUID of the cluster, and the orchestrator-location (which is the node whose IP address is `10.143.210.101`).
It also verifies that the cluster currently does not require rebalance, and that its minimum compatibility version is 6.6.
