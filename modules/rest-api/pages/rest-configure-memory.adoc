== Description

Allows a custom memory quota to be established for the Data, Index, Search, Eventing, and Analytics Services.
(The Query and Backup Services do not require a memory allocation.)
If no custom quota is specified for one or more services, those services retain the default allocations: these are, for the Data Service 256 Mb; for the Search Service 256 Mb; for the Index Service 512 Mb; for the Eventing Service 256 Mb; and for the Analytics Service 1024 Mb.
Note that in each case except the Analytics Service, the minimum allowed allocation is 256 Mb: for the Analytics Service, the minimum allowed allocation is 1024 Mb.

For information on the maximum memory allocation permitted for a node, see xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc#service-memory-quotas[Service Memory Quotas].

== Curl Syntax

----
curl  -v -X POST http://10.144.220.101:8091/pools/default \
  -d memoryQuota=<integer> \
  -d indexMemoryQuota=<integer> \
  -d eventingMemoryQuota=<integer> \
  -d ftsMemoryQuota=<integer> \
  -d cbasMemoryQuota=<integer> \
  -u <username>:<password>
----

Note that during the process of provisioning a single-node cluster, `username` and `password` are required after the administrator has established credentials, as described in xref:rest-api:rest-establish-credentials.adoc[Establishing Credentials].

== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.
Failure to specify the URI correctly returns `404 Object Not Found`.
Failure to specify a flag correctly returns `400 Bad Request`, and an error message such as: `{"errors":{"cbasMemoryQuo3ta":"Unsupported key"}}`.

If, as part of the provisioning process, a username and password have already been assigned to the cluster, failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.

== Example

The following example establishes the minimum allowed value for each service:

----
curl  -v -X POST http://10.144.220.101:8091/pools/default \
-u Administrator:password
-d 'memoryQuota=256' \
-d 'indexMemoryQuota=256' \
-d 'eventingMemoryQuota=256' \
-d 'ftsMemoryQuota=256' \
-d 'cbasMemoryQuota=1024'
----
