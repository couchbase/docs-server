== HTTP method and URI

Server nodes are typically removed from a cluster when the node is temporarily or permanently down.

The method `/controller/ejectNode` cannot remove active nodes.
It can be used only on failed over nodes, nodes in pending state, or nodes that have been recently added or joined but not yet rebalanced into the cluster.
Removing an active node must be done with the `/controller/rebalance` endpoint.
