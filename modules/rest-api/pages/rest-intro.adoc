The API also supports the extensive retrieval of statistics.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| HTTP response | Description

| 200 OK
| Successful request and an HTTP response body returns.
If this creates a new resource with a URI, the 200 status will also have a location header containing the canonical URI for the newly created resource.

| 201 Created
| Request to create a new resource is successful, but no HTTP response body returns.
The URI for the newly created resource returns with the status code.

| 202 Accepted
| The request is accepted for processing, but processing is not complete.
Per HTTP/1.1, the response, if any, SHOULD include an indication of the requestâ€™s current status, and either a pointer to a status monitor or some estimate of when the request will be fulfilled.

| 204 No Content
| The server fulfilled the request, but does not need to return a response body.

| 400 Bad Request
| The request could not be processed because it contains missing or invalid information, such as validation error on an input field, a missing required value, and so on.

| 401 Unauthorized
| The credentials provided with this request are missing or invalid.

| 403 Forbidden
| The server recognized the given credentials, but you do not possess proper access to perform this request.

| 404 Not Found
| URI provided in a request does not exist.

| 405 Method Not Allowed
| The HTTP verb specified in the request (DELETE, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT) is not supported for this URI.

| 406 Not Acceptable
| The resource identified by this request cannot create a response corresponding to one of the media types in the Accept header of the request.

| 409 Conflict
| A create or update request could not be completed, because it would cause a conflict in the current state of the resources supported by the server.
For example, an attempt to create a new resource with a unique identifier already assigned to some existing resource.

| 500 Internal Server Error
| The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.

| 501 Not Implemented
| The server does not currently support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
