== Description

This endpoint is used to update the global secondary index settings for the cluster.
The request is handled and validated by the cluster manager and then delegated to all relevant index nodes automatically.
All changes to the index settings via this method apply to all index nodes in the cluster.
Parameters which are not specified are left unchanged, it is not necessary to specify all parameters in the body.

== HTTP Method and URI

[source,http]
----
POST http://<host>:8091/settings/indexes
----

== Body Parameters

All of the following parameters are passed in the request body as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` data.
The parameters are specified as key-value pairs (e.g `key=value`).

*Optional*

|===
| Name | Description | Type

| `indexerThreads`
| Number of threads for the `indexer` process to use, this applies equally to all index nodes in the cluster regardless of the number of cores on each node.
A value of `0` causes the `indexer` process to use one thread per CPU core on each individual node.
| integer

| `logLevel`
| Indexer logging level.
a|
Possible values are:

* `silent`
* `fatal`
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `verbose`
* `timing`
* `debug`
* `trace`

| `maxRollbackPoints`
| Maximum number of committed rollback points.
| integer

| `memorySnapshotInterval`
| In-memory snapshotting interval in milliseconds.
| integer

| `numReplica`
| The default number of index replicas to be created by the Index Service whenever `CREATE INDEX` is invoked.
For further details, refer to {index-replication}[Index Replication].
| integer

| `redistributeIndexes`
| When `true`, Couchbase Server redistributes indexes when rebalance occurs, in order to optimize performance.
If `false` (the default), such redistribution does not occur.
For further details, refer to {rebalancing-the-index-service}[Rebalancing the Index Service].
| boolean

| `stableSnapshotInterval`
| Persisted snapshotting interval in milliseconds.
| integer

| `storageMode`
| The storage mode to be used for all global secondary indexes in the cluster.

'''
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

In the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, the options are `plasma` and `memory_optimized`.
A value of `plasma` sets the cluster-wide index storage mode to use the Plasma storage engine, which can utilize both memory and persistent storage for index maintenance and index scans.
A value of `memory_optimized` sets the cluster-wide index storage mode to use memory optimized global secondary indexes which can perform index maintenance and index scan faster at in-memory speeds.

This setting can only be changed while there are no index nodes in the cluster.
To change from standard GSI to memory optimized GSI or vice versa, you need to remove all the index service nodes in the cluster.

'''
[.edition]#{community}#

If you are using the Community Edition, the default (and only) value is `forestdb`.

Possible values are:

* `plasma`
* `memory_optimized`
* `forestdb`
