= Perform an Immediate Merge

[abstract]
The Backup Service REST API allows an immediate merge to be performed, on existing backups within a specified repository.

[#http-methods-and-uris]
== HTTP Methods and URIs

----
POST /cluster/self/repository/active/<repository-id>/merge
----

[#description]
== Description

Triggers an immediate merge for the specified active repository: thus, the need to wait for a scheduled backup can be eliminated as required.
The period of time for which backups should be merged must be specified as a JSON payload.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -x POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/cluster/self\
/repository/active/<repository-id>/merge \
  -u <username>:<password>
  -d <merge-period-specification>
----

The `username` and `password` must identify an administrator with the Full Admin role.
The `repository-id` must be the name of an active repository on the cluster.

The `merge-period-specification` must be a JSON document, containing the following:

* The most recent day whose backups should be included in the merge.

* The least recent day whose backups should be included in the merge.

Each day is specified as an integer; a lower integer representing a more recent day than does a higher; with `0` representing the current day.
The backups for all days that lie between the most and least recent specified are included in the merge.

Syntactically, the `merge-period-specification` is as follows:

----
{
  "offset_start": <integer-representing-most-recent-day>,
  "offset_end": <integer-representing-least-recent-day>
}
----

[#responses]
== Responses

If the call is successful, the merge-process is started, and `200 OK` is returned, with an object that provides a task-id for the merge.
For example: `{"task_name":"MERGE-9d10fefc-b9be-4980-879b-c66c9101644b"}`.

If the specified repository cannot be located, `404 Object Not Found` is returned, with an object such as the following: `{"status":404,"msg":"repository `restR3epo` does not exist"}`.

If the call is improperly formatted, `400 Bad Request` is returned; with an object such as the following: `{"status":400,"msg":"invalid request body","extras":"invalid character '{' looking for beginning of object key string"}`.

If an internal error prevents successful execution, `500 Internal Server Error` is returned, with an object containing a further error description.

Failure to authenticate returns `401 Unauthorized`.
An incorrectly specified URI returns `404 Object Not Found`.


[#examples]
== Examples

The following example triggers an immediate merge of all backups for the active repository `restRepo`, from the current day to two days ago:

----
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
repository/active/restRepo/merge \
-u Administrator:password \
-d '{"offset_start": 0,"offset_end": 2}'
----

If execution is successful, an object such as the following is returned:

----
{"task_name":"MERGE-759b7f20-acac-474d-8b9d-6fbbbaf7302d"}
----
