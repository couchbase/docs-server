= Archive a Repository

[abstract]
The Backup Service REST API supports the archiving of currently active repositories.

[#http-methods-and-uris]
== HTTP Method and URI

----
POST /repository/active/<repository-id>/archive
----

[#description]
== Description

Archives the specified repository.
This means that no further scheduled or manually triggered tasks can be run on the repository; with the exception of those that _retrieve information_, _restore data_,  and _examine data_.
(See xref:rest-api:backup-get-repository-info.adoc[Get Information on Repositories], xref:rest-api:backup-restore-data.adoc[Restore Data], and xref:rest-api:backup-examine-data.adoc[Examine Backed-Up Data], respectively.)

Note that a repository that has been archived _cannot_ be returned to active state.

[#curl-syntax]
== Curl Syntax

----
curl -X POST http://<backup-node-ip-address-or-domain-name>:8097/api/v1/cluster/self/\
  repository/active/<repository-id>/archive
  -d <repository-id-specification>
  -u Administrator:password
----

The `username` and `password` must identify an administrator with the Full Admin role.
The `repository-id` argument must specify the name of an active repository defined on the cluster.
Additionally, a `respository-id-specification` must be provided, as a JSON payload; whose syntax is as follows:

----
{
  "id":<archived-repository-id>
}
----

The `archived-repository-id` is the name that the repository is to bear, once it has been archived.

[#responses]
== Responses

Success returns `200 OK`.

Incorrect specification of the `repository-id` path-parameter returns `404 Object Not Found`, and a message such as the following: `{"status":404,"msg":"could not find active repository with id:quickRepo"}`.
An otherwise incorrectly specified URI alsp returns `404 Object Not Found`.

Incorrect specification, within the JSON payload, of the repository id returns `400 Bad Request`, and a message such as the following: `{"status":400,"msg":"repository id must follow the rules ^[0-9A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z_-]{0,49}$"}`.

[#examples]

----

repository/active/quickRepo/archive \
--data '{"id": "quickRepo"}' \
-u Administrator:password
