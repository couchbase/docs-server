== Discussion

The compact command can be run after a backup to reclaim any fragmented disk space in the backup data files.
It should be noted however that compaction may be run during the backup itself if the fragmentation in the data file begins to grow too big.
Although the compaction can run during the backup it is not guaranteed to be run once the backup has completed, hence the reason for the _compact_ command.

== Environment And Configuration Variables

(None)

== Files

shard-*.fdb

* The compact command will compact all shard-*.fdb files in the backup specified by the _compact_ command.
