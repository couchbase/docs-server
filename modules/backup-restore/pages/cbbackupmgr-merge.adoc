[#cbbackupmgr-merge.1]
= cbbackupmgr merge

[IMPORTANT]
====
Due to critical issues, we have temporarily deprecated the merge command in _cbbackupmgr_ from versions 4.5.x and 4.6.x.
We plan to fix those and re-introduce support for the command in the upcoming Couchbase Server 4.6.3 and 5.0 releases.

We found that a DCP rollback during backup can cause issues later when the merge command was run.
Scenarios such as database purging, bucket deletion and recreation, and bucket flush can cause a rollback.
To track this issue in JIRA, see https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-20403[MB-20403]
