= Backup and Restore
:description: In a production environment, as part of an overall Disaster Recovery plan, you must plan to back up your entire cluster periodically.

{description}
This helps ensure that you do not lose information in the event of a serious failure and minimizes data inconsistency when a restore is required.

Couchbase provides multiple means to facilitate backup and restore:

* Using [.cmd]`cbbackupmgr` Tool
+
Couchbase Backup Manager is an enterprise-grade backup and restore utility that is available in Couchbase Server _Enterprise Edition_ only.
It replaces the [.cmd]`cbbackup` and [.cmd]`cbrestore` tools as the primary and recommended means of backup and restore, for versions 4.5 and above.
It enables backup and restore of data, indexes, and bucket configurations at a dramatically increased speed over the previous generation tools.
All backups can be performed on a live running cluster.
Backup and restore using AWS S3 is supported.
For more information on cbbackupmgr, see xref:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[[.cmd]`cbbackupmgr` Tool].

* Using [.cmd]`cbbackup` and [.cmd]`cbrestore` Tools
+
The [.cmd]`cbbackup` and [.cmd]`cbrestore` tools provide simple yet effective backup and restore capabilities to Couchbase Server.
+
The cbbackup tool enables you to backup a single node, single buckets, or the entire cluster into a flexible backup structure.
The cbrestore tool restores data into the same or different clusters and buckets.
+
For more information on these tools, see xref:cli:cbtools/cbbackup.adoc[[.cmd]`cbbackup`] and xref:cli:cbtools/cbrestore.adoc[[.cmd]`cbrestore`].

NOTE: Due to the active nature of Couchbase Server, it is impossible to create a complete in-time backup and snapshot of the entire cluster.
Because the data is always being updated and modified, it is not possible to take an accurate snapshot.

NOTE: You must back up and restore your entire cluster to minimize any data inconsistencies.
Couchbase is always per-item consistent but does not guarantee total cluster consistency or in-order persistence.
