{description}

The following XDCR metrics can be queried by means of the REST APIs described in xref:rest-api:rest-statistics.adoc[Statistics].

See also the metrics provided in xref:metrics-reference:all-services-metrics.adoc[Metrics for All Services]; which are indeed for _all_ Couchbase-Server services, and so support XDCR.

NOTE: This section is currently under construction.
