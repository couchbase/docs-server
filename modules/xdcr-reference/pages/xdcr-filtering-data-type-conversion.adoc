= XDCR Data-Type Conversion

[abstract]
_XDCR filtering expressions_ are supported by data-type _conversion_ and _collation_, when different data-types are referred to.

== Understanding Data-Type Conversion

_XDCR filtering expressions_ allow case-sensitive matches, comparisons, logical and other operations to be performed on values within documents.
When values referenced by a filtering expression have different data-types, either _conversion_ or _collation_ is performed:

* _Conversion_ means that one or more of the values is converted from its existing data-type to another, so that the operation is performed on values of the same data-type.

* _Collation_ means that conversion is not possible; and that therefore, the operation will be otherwise resolved, according to a set of rules.

All conversion performed by XDCR is _implicit_, meaning that it is performed automatically within the system.
No _explicit_ conversion (that is, data-type conversion selected and imposed by the administrator) is supported.
