= XDCR Data-Type Conversion

[abstract]
_XDCR filtering expressions_ are supported by data-type _conversion_ and _collation_.

== Understanding Data-Type Conversion

_XDCR filtering expressions_ allow case-sensitive matches, comparisons, logical and other operations to be performed on values within documents.
When values referenced by a filtering expression have different data types, either _conversion_ or _collation_ is performed:

* _Conversion_ means that one or more of the values is converted from its existing data type to another, so that the operation is performed on values of the same data type.

* _Collation_ means that conversion is not possible; and that therefore, the operation will be otherwise resolved, according to a set of rules.

All conversion performed by XDCR is _implicit_, meaning that it is performed automatically within the system.
No _explicit_ conversion (that is, data-type conversion selected and imposed by the administrator) is supported.

[#supported-data-types]
== Supported Data Types

The data types supported by XDCR Filtering are listed below, in descending order of _precedence_ &#8212; the lowest precedence-value (and earliest position) therefore indicating the highest precedence.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| *Precedence* | *Data Type*
| 0 | Invalid
| 1 | Missing
| 2 | Null
| 3 | Boolean
| 4 | Numeric
| 5 | String
| 6 | Time
| 7 | Array
| 8 | Object
| 9 | Binary
|===

When an expression entails values of the same data type, no conversion is required.
When the data types differ, and conversion or collation is therefore required, data types take precedence in accordance with their closeness to the top of the list.
For example, if an operation refers to two values, one of which is _Invalid_ and the other of which is _Boolean_, the _Invalid_ value determines the result.
As another example, if an operation refers to two values, one of which is _Boolean_ and the other _Numeric_, the _Numeric_ value is if possible converted to _Boolean_, and the operation performed.

[#numeric-type-conversion]
== Numeric Data-Type Internal Conversions

A value of the _Numeric_ data type (listed above, in xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#supported-data-types[Supported Data Types]) always further corresponds to one of three _internal_ numeric data types; which are _unsigned integer_, _integer_, and _float_.
When two _Numeric_ data-type values are referenced in a filtering expression, comparisons (_e.g._ equality, inequality) and operations (_e.g._ addition, subtraction) are performed as indicated in the following table.

[cols="3,3,7,7"]
|===
| *Type 1* | *Type 2* | *Comparison* | *Operation*

| `Uint`
| `Uint`
| The comparison is performed.
| The operation is performed.
If the operation results in a negative value, both values are converted to `Int`, and the operation is repeated; _unless_ one or both conversions to `Int` would result in overflow, in which case `InvalidValue` is returned.

| `Uint`
| `Int`
| If `Int` is negative, `Uint` is converted to `Int`, and the comparison is performed; _unless_ the conversion to `Int` would result in overflow, in which case `InvalidValue` is returned.

If `Int` is positive, `Int` is converted to `Uint`, and the comparison is performed.

| The operation is performed.
If the result is an `Int`, the `Int` is returned.
If the result is a valid `Uint`, the `Uint` is returned.
If the result is a _non-valid_ `Uint` (due to the result's being negative), the result is converted to `Int`, and is returned as such; _unless_ the conversion to `Int` would result in overflow, in which case, `InvalidValue` is returned.

| `Uint`
| `Float`
| `Uint` is converted to `Float`, and the comparison is performed.
| `Uint` is converted to `Float`, and the operation is performed.

| `Int`
| `Float`
| `Int` is converted to `Float`, and the comparison is performed.
| `Int` is converted to `Float`, and the operation is performed.

| `Float`
| `Float`
| The comparison is performed.
| The operation is performed.

| `Int`
| `Int`
| The comparison is performed.
| The operation is performed.

[#implicit-conversion-vs-collation-comparison]
== Implicit Conversion versus Collation Comparison

_Implicit conversion_ occurs when Couchbase Server converts a value from its existing data type to another, so that a comparison or operation can be performed on values of the same data type.
Implicit conversion is only _sometimes_ possible: therefore, when an existing data type _cannot_ be implicitly converted into another, _collation comparison_ is used instead.

Collation comparison works as follows:

* _Equality_ and _inequality_.
Checking for _equality_ between different data types returns `false`.
Therefore, if `var1` and `var2` represent different data types, the expression `var1 == var2` returns `false`.
+
Checking for _inequality_ between different data types returns `true`.
Therefore, if `var1` and `var2` represent different data types, the expression `var1 != var2` returns `true`.

* _Regular expression_ matches.
Checking for a regular-expression _match_ between different data types returns `false`.
Therefore, if `var1` and `var2` represent different data types, the expression `REGEXP_CONTAINS(var1, var2)` returns `false`.
+
Checking for a regular-expression _non-match_ between different data types returns `true`.
Therefore, if `var1` and `var2` represent different data types, the expression `NOT REGEXP_CONTAINS(var1, var2)` returns `true`.

* _Magnitude comparison_ between different data types is resolved in accordance with the respective positions of the data types in the list of xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#supported-data-types[Supported Data Types]).
This list presents the supported data types in order of _precedence_: note that _precedence_ and _magnitude_ are inversely proportional; and that therefore, the data type at the bottom of the list (Binary) has the least precedence and greatest magnitude; while the data type at the top (Invalid) has the greatest precedence and least magnitude.
+
Consequently, if the data type of `var1` is _below_ that of `var2` in the list, the expression `var1 > var2` returns `true`; and the expression `var1 < var2` returns `false`.

[#implicit-conversion-modes]
== Implicit Conversion Modes

Each filter expression requires implicit conversion to be applied to one of the following combinations:

* _A Constant and a Variable_.
The filter expression contains a user-specified constant and a variable, which are to be compared.
Couchbase Server determines the data type of the constant, and attempts to apply this data type to the value of the variable.

* _Two Variables_.
The filter expression specifies two variables, which are to be compared.
Couchbase Server determines the data type of the variables from the corresponding values in the JSON document to which filtering is currently being applied.

These modes are described in the subsections below.

[#implicit-conversion-of-constant-and-variable]
=== Implicit Conversion of Constant and Variable.

When a constant and a variable are to be compared, Couchbase Server determines the data type of the constant, and attempts to apply this also to the value of the variable.

[#data-type-conversion-of-user-specified-constants]
==== Data-Type Conversion of User-Specified Constants

When the user explicitly enters a _constant_ into a filter expression, the data type for the constant is evaluated by Couchbase Server, as part of its process for _tokenizing_ the expression (that is, parsing the expression into identifiable lexical components).

The correspondences between token formats and duly assigned data types is described in the following table.

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| *Token Format* | *Assigned Data Type* | *Example*

| Any character-sequence enclosed either by double quotes (`""`) or by single quotes (`''`).
| `String`
| `variable == "a string"`

`Variable == 'another string'`

| Any numeric values without precision delimiter or mantissa.
| `Int`
| `variable > 1234`

`variable < -2345`

| Any number representing a valid `golang` float, optionally with precision delimiter and/or mantissa.
| `Float64`
| `variable >= 1.2343+25`

| Any of the following, specified without enclosing punctuation (such as commas or inverted commas):
`true`, `TRUE`, `false`, `FALSE`.
| `Boolean`
| `variable == true`

`variable != FALSE`

| Either of the keyword-phrases `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`.
| `null`
| `variable IS NULL`

`variable IS NOT NULL`

| Valid hard-coded strings wrapped by the `DATE()` function.
| `date`
| `variable < DATE("2018-10-17T00:01:02Z")`

|===

[#mathematical-data-types]
===== Mathematical Data Types

_Mathematical expressions_ may be entered as constants.

*Division*

When an expression includes a _division_ operation, the result of which is intended to be a decimal number, the operands themselves must be specified as (or, if they are variables, allowed to be implicitly cast to) decimals.

For example, if `A == 4` returns `true`, then `1 / A == 0.25` returns `false`; because the expression `1 / A` casts `A` implicitly to `Int`, and duly returns an `Int`.
Thus, `Int(1 / 4) == 0` returns `true`.

On the other hand, `1.0 / A == 0.25` returns `true`; because the expression `1.0 / A` casts `A` implicitly to `Float64`, and duly returns a `Float64`.
Thus, `1.0 / 4.0 == 0.25` returns `true`.

[#not-a-number-values]
*Not-a-Number Values*

`NaN` (_Not-a-Number_) float-values are considered _less_ than any other real number.

Two `NaNs` do _not_ yield equality.
Note, however, that the operators `&lt;&#61;` and `&#61;&gt;` return `true`: this differs from the `golang` standard (according to which these operators return `false`).

[#data-type-conversion-of-variable-values]
==== Data-Type Conversion of Variable-Values, for Comparison with Constants

When an expression includes both a constant and a variable, xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#implicit-conversion-to-constant-data-type[Implicit Conversion to Constant Data-Type] is performed on the constant.
Then, the data-type derived from evaluation of the constant is assigned, attemptedly, to the value represented by the variable.

For example, given the expression `variable > 4.5`, the constant `4.5` is determined to be a `Float64`; and the value of `variable` is then attemptedly converted to `Float64`.

If conversion of the variable's value into the data type specified by the user is not possible, collation comparison is performed.
For example, given the expression `variable != true`, if the value of `variable` is not `Boolean`, collation comparison is performed, and `true` is returned, due to the data types being different.

If the data-type of the user-specified constant is `Numeric`, and the value of the variable is also `Numeric`, the appropriate numeric data-type internal conversion is performed (see xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#numeric-type-conversion[above]).

If the value is `NaN`, the value is converted to the `Invalid` data-type, and collation comparison is performed.
For example, given the expression `ASIN(variable) > 0`, if the value of `variable` is `93`, then `ASIN(93)`
results in a `NaN` value, which is then duly converted to `Invalid`.
Collation comparison is then performed, and returns that the `NaN` is smaller than the `Int`.

Alternatively, given the expression `ASIN(variable) != 0`, collation comparison returns `true`, due to the comparison's being made between different data types (`Invalid` and `Int`).

An explanation of comparisons with `NaN` values is provided in xref:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#not-a-number-values[Not-a-Number Values], above.

[#implicit-conversion-between-variables]
=== Implicit Conversion between Variables

When an expression consists entirely of variables (for example, `variable != otherVariable`), Couchbase Server retrieves the corresponding values from the JSON document to which filtering is currently being applied, and performs conversions on the values.

The result of conversion may vary for each variable, document by document, based on changes encountered in JSON definitions.

Couchbase Server performs conversion differently, according to whether both values are determined to be `Numeric`.

==== Numeric Comparison

If the values of both variables are determined to be `Numeric`, the appropriate numerical comparison from those described in xref:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#data-type-conversion-of-user-specified-constants[Data Type Conversion of User-Specified Constants] is made.

==== Non-Numeric Comparison

If the values for the variables are not both numeric, then both require non-numeric conversion.
Conversion is performed based on the following sequence:

. Whether the perceived types support comparison.
See the diagram in xref:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#supported-type-conversions[Supported and Unsupported Type Conversions] for information.

. Whether, if the perceived types _do_ support comparison, a successful attempt can be made to convert the less restrictive data type to the more restricted.
See the table in xref:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc#supported-data-types[Supported Data Types], for information.

. Whether, if the less restrictive data type _cannot_ be converted to the more restricted, the more restricted can be converted to the less.

If conversion cannot be achieved by the above sequence, collation comparison is performed.

For example, given the expression `variable1 > variable2`, where `variable1` is the `Boolean` value `true`, and `variable2` is the `String` value `"test"`:

. The perceived types are checked as to whether they support direct comparison.
They do not.

. The `String` value `test` is attemptedly cast to a `Boolean`: which fails.

. The `Boolean` value `true` is attemptedly cast to a `String`: which succeeds &#8212; the new `String` value being `"true"`.

A comparison between the strings is now performed, with the result being `true`.

Alternatively, given the same expression, where `variable1` is now the `String` value `"test"`, and `variable2` is a JSON array; conversion cannot be achieved by the sequence.
Therefore, collation comparison is performed; the result of which is `false`, because `Array` is of lower precedence that `String`.
