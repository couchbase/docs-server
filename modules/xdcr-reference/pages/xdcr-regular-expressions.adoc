== XDCR Regular Expressions

The following JavaScript regular expressions (RegExes) can be used for XDCR Advanced Filtering.
Note that regular expressions are case-sensitive: a lowercase '[.code]``a``' is distinct from an uppercase '[.code]``A``'.
You can enclose a range of characters in square brackets, to match against all of those characters.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions[Regular Expressions] and https://www.regular-expressions.info/[Regular-Expressions.info], for further information.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Expression | Description

| `[tT]here`
| Matches against 'There' and 'there'

| `[ ]`
| Can be used on a range of characters separated by a `-` character.

| `[0-9]`
| Matches any digit.

| `[A-Z]`
| Matches any uppercase alpha character.

| `[A-Za-z0-9]`
| Matches any alphanumeric character.

| `^`
| Matches the beginning of input.
For example, `^a` matches `abb` and `ab`; but does _not_ match `ba`, `bab`, or `bba`.

Used within square brackets, as the first character, `^` implies _negation_: therefore, `[^0-9]` matches against any character that is not a digit.

| `$`
| Matches the end of input.
For example, `a$` matches `ba` and `bba`; but does _not_ match `abb`, `bab`, or `ab`.

Ranges can be used to specify a group of characters.
The following shortcuts are also available:

[cols="1,4"]

| Expression | Description

| `.`
| Matches against any character.

| `\d`
| Matches against a digit [0-9].

| `\D`
| Matches against a non-digit `[^0-9]`.

| `\s`
| Matches against a whitespace character (such as a tab, space, or line-feed character).

| `\S`
| Matches against a non-whitespace character.

| `\w`
| Matches against an alphanumeric character `[a-zA-Z_0-9]`.

| `\W`
| Matches against a non-alphanumeric character.

| `\xhh`
| Matches against a control character (for the hexadecimal character `hh`).

| `\uhhhh`
| Matches against a Unicode character (for the hexadecimal character `hhhh`).
|===

Note that since the backslash character is used to denote a specific search expression, a double backslash (`\\`) must be entered when the backslash is the search target.

To match against occurrences of a character or expression, you can use the following.

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Expression | Description

| `*`
| Matches against zero or more occurrences of the previous character or expression.

| `+`
| Matches against one or more occurrences of the previous character or expression.

| `?`
| Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character or expression.

| `(n)`
| Matches `n` occurrences of the previous character or expression.

| `(n,m)`
| Matches from `n` to `m` occurrences of the previous character or expression.

| `(n,)`
| Matches at least `n` occurrences of the previous character or expression.
