== Security and Networking Contexts

This page considers a number of specific contexts in which XDCR replications must sometimes be established.
These respectively involve:

* Handling _Couchbase Schemes_ with _DNS SRV_

* Using _Alternate Addresses_

* Using _Third Party CAs_

Each context is explained below.

== Handling Couchbase Schemes with DNS SRV

Targets for XDCR replication can be specified using the schemes _http://_ or _https://_, and with the standard port number `8091` or `18091`, as applicable.
Targets _cannot_ be specified with the Couchbase schemes _couchbase://_ and _couchbases://_, which are used to support the memcached protocol on ports `11210` and `11207`, respectively.

Targets _can_, however, be specified with a _Fully Qualified Domain Name_ (_FQDN_), which is not tagged with either of the standard port numbers.
In such cases, XDCR performs a https://go.dev/src/net/lookup.go[LookupSRV^] on the FQDN, using the local machineâ€™s _DNS resolver_.
LookupSRV obtains the appropriate name from a local DNS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record[SRV record^]: which is a specification of data in the Domain Name System that defines the _location_ (the hostname and port number) of a server for a particular service.
When LookupSRV has returned the name, XDCR concatenates a standard port number to the name, and uses the resulting concatenation as the target-reference.

Consequently, resources named by means of the Couchbase schemes can be resolved to appropriate XDCR-target names: by first removing the _couchbase_ or _couchbases_ prefix, and then specifying the resulting FQDN -- so that LookupSRV resolves the FQDN to a name that XDCR can include in the ultimate target-reference.
Note, however, that this does assume the target's use of one of the standard port numbers -- `8091` or `18091` -- for XDCR access.

=== Example

Suppose a resource is provided with the Couchbase scheme as follows: `couchbases://7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com`.
The scheme's prefix `couchbases://` can be removed, so as to leave an FQDN as follows: `7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com`.
This FQDN can be specified by the administrator as the _hostname_ of the target cluster for XDCR replication.

The command `nslookup -type=srv` can be used manually to determine whether this hostname corresponds to one or more true, DNS SVR records.
The form of an SRV record is as follows:

----
_service._proto.name. ttl IN SRV priority weight port target
----

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record[SRV record^], for a full explanation of this syntax.

To perform the manual lookup, we provide values for the `_service._proto.name.` arguments.
Thus, we use `couchbases` for the `service` argument; `tcp` for the `proto` argument; and the hostname `7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com` for the `name` argument.
Our command is therefore executed as follows:

----
nslookup -type=srv _couchbases._tcp.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com
----

If successful, the command returns output similar to the following:

----
Server:		176.103.130.130
Address:	176.103.130.130#53

Non-authoritative answer:
_couchbases._tcp.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com	service = 0 0 11207 cb-0001.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com.
_couchbases._tcp.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com	service = 0 0 11207 cb-0002.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com.
_couchbases._tcp.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com	service = 0 0 11207 cb-0000.7cb51b5b-d9cd-410d-9cc7-1be93e2f31d9.dp.cloud.couchbase.com.
----

This output shows that three SRV records have been found to correspond with the values we specified.
The final value of each displayed record is the `target` for the record: each is a name beginning with `cb-`; and each name corresponds to an individual, server node.
Any of these `target` names can now be used as an XDCR target-reference, if either `:8091` or `18091` is appended to it.

The process shown manually above is essentially that followed programmatically by LookupSRV.
Note that XDCR ignores the value of the `port` argument returned in the record (which is in each case the secure memcached port, `11207`).

Using the final, _derived FQDN_, XDCR then performs its usual _cluster add_ procedure, to contact the other server nodes.

== Using Alternate Addresses

_Alternate addresses_ are used to allow a cluster to keep its _internally visible_ addresses private, while using a router or other networked entity to provide _externally visible_ addresses that are to be used by networked clients of the cluster.
Instances of _Kubernetes_ and _AWS_ frequently use alternate addresses for their connections with external entities.

Alternate addresses used in this way are said to constitute an _external network_.
Any cluster that is established within an external network must have its nodes configured to use the corresponding alternate addresses for external communications; and if the cluster is to be used as an XDCR target, these addresses must be referenced by the XDCR source.
This involves, on the target, _port forwarding_, which is described in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#alternate-addresses[Alternate Addresses].
It also involves, on the source, specification of the external network interface, either as a fully qualified domain name, or an IP address.

When a cluster has been configured in this way for external networking, and status on the cluster is returned by means of Couchbase Web Console, the CLI, or the REST API, both the internal and the external addresses are represented.

The REST API reference page xref:rest-api:rest-set-up-alternate-address.adoc[Managing Alternate Addresses] explains how alternate addresses can be established for and removed from nodes.
The REST API reference page xref:rest-api:rest-list-node-services.adoc[Listing Node Services] explains how to retrieve all internal and external address settings.

=== Kubernetes

_Kubernetes_ employs a dual network environment, where an external interface is established for the reception of externally generated network traffic.
Such traffic includes inbound XDCR mutations: therefore, the source cluster must use the external interface established for Kubernetes.

A diagram of dual-network setup is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#dual-network[Dual Network].

=== AWS and Cloud

If a cluster is established on a public cloud such as AWS, or is a K8 cluster, and is intended to become the target for XDCR, the cluster must be configured with alternate addresses, to support the source cluster's access.
A diagram is provided in xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/connectivity.adoc#internal-network-or-cloud-access[Internal Network or Cloud Access].
