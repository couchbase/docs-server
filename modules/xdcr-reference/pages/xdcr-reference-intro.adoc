= XDCR Reference

[abstract]
XDCR can be configured by means of _Advanced Settings_, and the replicated content determined through _Advanced Filtering Expressions_. This section provides a reference to each.

== XDCR Settings and Filtering Expressions

XDCR (_Cross Datacenter Replication_) allows data to be replicated across clusters that are potentially locaed in different datacenters.
For a conceptual overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR)].
For information on managing XDCR, see xref:manage:manage-xdcr/xdcr-management-overview.adoc[XDCR Management Overview].

XDCR replications are supported by:

* _Advanced Settings_.
The performance of XDCR can be fine-tuned, by means of configuration-settings, specified when a replication is defined.
These settings modify compression, source and target nozzles (worker threads), checkpoints, counts, sizes, network usage limits, and more.
A detailed reference is provided in xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc[XDCR Advanced Settings].

* _Advanced Filtering_.
This allows specified subsets of documents to be replicated from the source bucket.
Subsets are determined by achieving matches on fields and their values, within documents.
Matches are established by means of xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-regular-expressions.adoc[Regular Expressions] and xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-expressions.adoc[Filtering Expressions].
General configuration information is provided in xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering].
