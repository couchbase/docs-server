== Configuring XDCR Filtering

Full, Cluster, and XDCR Administrators can configure XDCR filtering.
For a conceptual overview, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering].

_Regular_ and _filtering_ expressions are applied, on the source cluster, to documents' keys, values, and metadata: documents that provide a match are replicated to the target; other documents are _not_ replicated.

Multiple expressions can be used by a single replication: the expressions should be `ORed`, as follows: `filterExpression0|filterExpression1`.
For example, the expression `airline|hotel` would match both `unitedairline` and `marriothotel`.

Filtering can be established when a replication is created, by means of Couchbase Web Console, CLI, or REST API.
Once a replication is underway, its established filtering-expression can be modified; and the replication then either restarted or allowed to continue.

Filtering does not impact conflict resolution, and can be used with either the _revision-based_ or the _timestamp-based_ conflict resolution policy.
Filtering does not affect the ability to pause and resume replications.
When multiple filtered replications are being established from the same source, expressions should typically be defined so as avoid the unnecessary re-replication of individual documents.

Note that filtering may impact replication-performance; resulting in higher load, reduced throughput, and increased latency.

A full account of XDCR Advanced Filtering expression-syntax is provided in  xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-regular-expressions.adoc[XDCR Regular Expressions] and xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-expressions.adoc[XDCR Filtering Expressions].
Note that expressions that attempt to compare values whose data types differ from one another must be handled either by _data-type conversion_ or by _collation comparison_.
These procedures, which are performed implicitly, are described in xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-data-type-conversion.adoc[ XDCR Data-Type Conversion].
