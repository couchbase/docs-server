An arbiter node helps your cluster in two ways:

** It provides xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#fast-failover[fast failover] which helps decrease the cluster's latency when reacting to a failover.

** It provides xref:install:deployment-considerations-lt-3nodes.adoc#quorum-arbitration[quorum arbitration] that helps avoid contention issues if the nodes in the cluster become partitioned.
