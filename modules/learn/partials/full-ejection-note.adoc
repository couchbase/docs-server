Full Ejection is recommended when the xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage-engines.adoc#storage-engine-magma[Magma storage engine] is used as the storage engine for a bucket. 
This is especially the case when the ratio of memory to data is very low (Magma allows you to go as low as 1% of memory to data ratio).
