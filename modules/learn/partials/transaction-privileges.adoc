To execute a key-value operation within a transaction, users must have the relevant _Administrative_ or _Data_ RBAC roles, and permissions on the relevant buckets, scopes and collections.

Similarly, to run a query statement within a transaction, users must have the relevant _Administrative_ or _Query & Index_ RBAC roles, and permissions on the relevant buckets, scopes and collections.

Refer to xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles] for details.

[NOTE]
.Query Mode
When a transaction executes a query statement, the transaction enters query mode, which means that the query is executed with the user's query permissions.
Any key-value operations which are executed by the transaction _after_ the query statement are _also_ executed with the user's query permissions.
These may or may not be different to the user's data permissions; if they are different, you may get unexpected results.
