Principal terms and their meanings.

The following glossary introduces the principal terms used in descriptions of Couchbase Server-technology.
Use the links to locate the full descriptions of each.

* xref:introduction:intro.adoc[Server]: An instance of _Couchbase Server_ â€” an open source, distributed, NoSQL document-oriented engagement database, specialized to provide low-latency data management for large-scale interactive web, mobile, and other applications.
Each instance runs on its own physical or virtual machine.
* xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Cluster]: One or more instances of Couchbase Server, each running on an independent node; but cooperating with any and all others, so as to form a unified system; whereby resources are shared, and a single interface provided for data-access and management.
* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Bucket]: A logical, user-named entity that groups items; allowing them to be accessed, indexed, replicated, and access-controlled.
There are three types:
 ** *Couchbase*: Retains data both in memory and on disk.
 ** *Ephemeral*: Retains data in memory only.
 ** *Memcached*: Designed to be used in the context of other database platforms, such as ones employing relational database technology, in order to provide a managed memory-cache for frequently-used data.
 * xref:data/durability.adoc[Durability]: The atomic commitment of a single-document data-write, which ensures the write's greatest likelihood of surviving an unexpected anomaly, such as a node-outage, prior to the write's propagation throughout the entire cluster.
* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/memory.adoc[Memory]: An automatically managed caching layer, supporting high-speed data-access.
* xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc[Storage]: The persistent retention of items on disk, in compressed form, with high-speed threaded access.
* xref:data/data.adoc[Data]: Items, each of which consists of a key by which the item is referenced; and an associated value, which must be either binary or a JSON document.
 ** Access: The creation, update, and deletion of items, as supported by
 xref:manage:manage-ui/manage-ui.adoc[Couchbase Web Console] and the xref:sdk:development-intro.adoc[Couchbase SDK].
 ** xref:data/document-data-model.adoc[Model]: A lightweight, flexible schema; which can be progressively evolved by applications over time, and allows information to be stored in the form of items.
* xref:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc[Node]: A computer (potentially, a virtual machine) running an instance of Couchbase Server.
 ** xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Addition]: The ability to add a Couchbase Cluster of one node to another existing cluster, so that a single, combined cluster is produced. Following addition, rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.
 ** xref:clusters-and-availability/failover.adoc[Failover]: The ability to allow healthy nodes to continue functioning as a cluster, potentially without data-loss, when one node has gone offline.
 Rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.
 Failover can be automated.
 ** xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Removal]: The ability to remove a node from a cluster.
 Following removal, rebalance ensures that data and indexes are optimally distributed across all available nodes.
* xref:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc[Rebalance]: The process of redistributing data and indexes optimally among the available nodes of a cluster.
This should be performed whenever a cluster-configuration has changed.
* xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Availability]: The preservation of data from system-failure, by the following means:
 ** xref:backup-restore:backup-restore.adoc[Backup and Restore]: The
 storing in archive-repositories of the current state of data, indexes, and bucket configurations; and the restoration of such state to a running cluster.
 ** xref:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Datacenter Replication] (_XDCR_): The replication of data between clusters, to ensure the least chance of data-loss in the event of data-center failure, and to provide high-performance data-access for globally distributed applications.
 ** xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-recovery.adoc[Data Recovery]: The restoration of current data to a node that is recovered from failure: either by updating data still held locally, or by substituting current data from other nodes.
 ** xref:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster Replication]: The maintenance and continuous update of data-copies, distributed across the nodes of a cluster, to ensure the least chance of data-loss in the event of single-node failure.
* xref:install:get-started.adoc[Deployment]: The installation of a single instance of Couchbase Server, subsequent to the appropriate resourcing and configuration of an underlying platform.
 ** xref:cloud:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc[Cloud]: Couchbase Server runs on a pre-established cloud-configuration.
 ** xref:install:running-couchbase-in-containers.adoc[Container]: Couchbase Server runs within a software container or virtual machine.
 ** xref:install:install-intro.adoc[Native]: Couchbase Server runs on an individual, physical machine.
* xref:manage:manage-nodes/initialize-node.adoc[Initialization]: The configuration of a new instance of Couchbase Server, either as the first node in a new cluster, or as an additional node for an existing cluster.
* xref:learn:security/security-overview.adoc[Security]: Couchbase-Server Authentication, Authorization, Auditing, and Encryption.
 ** xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc[Authentication]: To access Couchbase Server, administrators and applications must be authenticated.
 Authentication is a process for identifying a user who is attempting to access a system.
 Authentication can be attempted by passing credentials, or by means of certificates.
 ** xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization]: Role-Based Access Control (_RBAC_), whereby access-privileges are assigned to fixed roles that are assigned to administrators and applications.
 ** xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing]: The detailed, automated recording of actions performed on Couchbase Server, allowing administrative review; in order to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately performed.
 ** xref:learn:security/encryption-overview.adoc[Encryption]: The protection of data on the wire, at rest, and in applications; by means of encoding.
* xref:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services]: Couchbase Server-facilities that support different forms of data-access:
 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/analytics-service.adoc[Analytics]: Supports join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations that are expected to be large, long-running, and highly consumptive of memory and CPU resources.
 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data]: Supports the storing, setting, and retrieving of data-items, specified by key.
 ** xref:eventing:eventing-overview.adoc[Eventing]: Supports near real-time handling of changes to data: code can be executed both in response to document-mutations, and as scheduled by timers.
 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/index-service.adoc[Index]: Creates indexes, for use by the Query Service.
 ** xref:services-and-indexes/services/query-service.adoc[Query]: Parses input specified in the N1QL query-language, executes queries, and returns results.
The Query Service interacts with both the Data and Index services.
 ** xref:fts:full-text-intro.adoc[Search]: Creates indexes specially purposed for Full Text Search.
This supports language-aware searching; allowing users to search for, say, the word beauties, and additionally obtain results for beauty and beautiful.
* xref:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Scaling]: The optional allocation of services to cluster-nodes in accordance with workload-requirements.
For example, if a particular service is expected to handle a heavy workload, it can be allocated a large memory quota, and might be deployed as the only service on its node, to ensure optimal availability of CPU cycles.
* xref:manage:management-overview.adoc#couchbase-server-tools[Tools]: Provided by Couchbase Server to support cluster-management:
 ** xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI]: Command-line-based management.
 ** xref:manage:manage-ui/manage-ui.adoc[Couchbase Web Console]: UI-based management.
 ** xref:rest-api:rest-intro.adoc[REST API]: RESTful management. Note that the REST API, as well as being directly available to the administrator, also underlies the features of the Couchbase Web Console and CLI.
* xref:java-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[SDK]: Libraries that support cluster-access for applications written in multiple languages.
