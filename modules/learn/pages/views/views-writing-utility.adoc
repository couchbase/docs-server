Couchbase Server incorporates different utility functions beyond the core JavaScript functionality that can be used within `map()` and `reduce()` functions where relevant.

* `dateToArray(date)`

Converts a JavaScript Date object or a valid date string such as "2012-07-30T23:58:22.193Z" into an array of individual date components.
For example, the previous string would be converted into a JavaScript array:

----
[2012, 7, 30, 23, 58, 22]
----

The function can be particularly useful when building views using dates as the key where the use of a reduce function is being used for counting or rollup.

Currently, the function works only on UTC values.
Timezones are not supported.

* `decodeBase64(doc)`

Converts a binary (base64) encoded value stored in the database into a string.
This can be useful if you want to output or parse the contents of a document that has not been identified as a valid JSON value.

* `sum(array)`

When supplied with an array containing numerical values, each value is summed and the resulting total is returned.

For example:

----
sum([12,34,56,78])
----
