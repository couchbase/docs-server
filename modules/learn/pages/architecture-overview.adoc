An overview of Couchbase Server's architecture and core features.

== Architecture and Core Features

This section provides descriptions of Couchbase Server's architecture and core features.
The descriptions are organized as follows:

* *Data*: Couchbase Server stores data as _items_.
Each item consists of a _key_, by which the item is referenced; and an associated _value_, which must be either _binary_ or a _JSON document_.
+
See xref:data/data.adoc[Data] for information.

* *Buckets, Memory, and Storage*: Items are stored in named _Buckets_; being kept only in memory, others both in memory and on disk.
+
See xref:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets-memory-and-storage.adoc[Buckets, Memory, and Storage] for information.

* *Services and Indexes*: _Services_ can be deployed to support different forms of data-access: for example, the _Data Service_ allows items to be retrieved by _key_; while the _Query Service_ allows them to be retrieved by means of _queries_, designed in the _N1QL_ query-language. Individual services can be configured to run across multiple cluster-nodes, allowing high-priority workloads to be distributed and scaled appropriately.
_Indexes_ support services, by enabling high-performance access to data.
+
See xref:services-and-indexes/services-and-indexes.adoc[Services and Indexes] for information.

* *Clusters and Availability*: A single node running Couchbase Server is considered a _cluster_ of one node.
As successive nodes are initialized, each can be configured to join the existing cluster.
+
Across the nodes of each cluster, Couchbase data is evenly distributed and replicated: nodes can be removed, and node-failure handled, without data-loss.
Data can be selected for replication across clusters residing in different data centers, to ensure high availability.
+
See xref:clusters-and-availability/clusters-and-availability.adoc[Clusters and Availability] for information.

* *Security*: Couchbase Server can be rendered highly secure, so as to preserve the privacy and integrity of data, and account for access-attempts.
The security facilities provided cover areas including _Authentication_, _Authorization_, and _Auditing_.
+
See xref:learn:security/security-overview.adoc[Security] for information.
