= Extended Attributes
:page-aliases: understanding-couchbase:data/extended-attributes-fundamentals

[abstract]
Couchbase Server permits the definition of _extended attributes_.
These allow developers to define application-specific metadata visible only to those applications that request it or attempt to modify it.
This might be, for example, metadata specific to a programming framework that should be hidden by default from other frameworks, or possibly from other versions of the same framework.

== Definition, Access, and Discovery

The Couchbase SDK supports the creation and modification of extended attributes by applications written in xref:nodejs-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Node.js], xref:java-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Java], xref:dotnet-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[.NET], xref:php-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[PHP], xref:python-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Python], xref:go-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Go], and xref:c-sdk::sdk-xattr-example.adoc[C].
This is achieved by extensions to the xref:java-sdk::subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-document API].
Extended attributes can be formed only as JSON, but can be applied to both JSON and binary items.

The creator-application can subsequently access and modify the extended attributes it has created within a document.
However, Couchbase Server provides no facility for enumerating or sharing knowledge of extended attributes: therefore, no application has knowledge of the extended attributes within a document other than their creator; unless such knowledge is shared explicitly between applications by some mechanism external to Couchbase Server.

== Implications for Sizing

Within Couchbase Server, the maximum size for each document is 20 megabytes (see the section xref:data/data.adoc#size-limits[Size Limits], on the page xref:data/data.adoc[Data]).
Extended attributes count against this size-limit: consequently, the size of a document may reflect the presence of data inaccessible to some applications.

== Virtual Extended Attributes

A _virtual_ extended attribute exposes additional information about a document.
Couchbase Server provides a single virtual extended attribute, `$document`, which, when specified as a search-path, returns metadata on the document.
Ouput might appear as follows:

         }
