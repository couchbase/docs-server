= Extended Attributes
:page-aliases: understanding-couchbase:data/extended-attributes-fundamentals,developer-guide:extended-attributes-fundamentals

[abstract]
Couchbase Server permits the definition of _extended attributes_.
These allow developers to define application-specific metadata visible only to those applications that request it or attempt to modify it.
This might be, for example, metadata specific to a programming framework that should be hidden by default from other frameworks, or possibly from other versions of the same framework.

== Definition, Access, and Discovery

The Couchbase SDK supports applications' creation and modification of extended attributes (sometimes referred to as _XATTRs_).
This is achieved by extensions to the _Sub-Document_ API (see xref:learn:data/data.adoc#sub-documents-overview[Sub-Documents]).
Extended attributes can be formed only as JSON, but can be applied to both JSON and binary items.


The creator-application can subsequently access and modify the extended attributes it has created within a document.
However, no other application has knowledge of the extended attributes within a document other than their creator; unless such knowledge is shared explicitly between applications by some mechanism external to Couchbase Server.

== Implications for Sizing

Within Couchbase Server, the maximum size for each document is 20 megabytes (see the section xref:data/data.adoc#size-limits[Size Limits], on the page xref:data/data.adoc[Data]).
Extended attributes count against this size-limit: consequently, the size of a document may reflect the presence of data inaccessible to some applications.

== Virtual Extended Attributes

A _virtual_ extended attribute (sometimes referred to as a _VXATTR_) exposes additional information about a document.
Couchbase Server provides a single virtual extended attribute, `$document`, which, when specified as a search-path, returns metadata on the document.
Ouput might appear as follows:

      GET($document)
