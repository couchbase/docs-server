= Scopes and Collections

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides _scopes_ and _collections_; allowing documents to be categorized and organized, within a bucket.

[#understanding-scopes-and-collections]
== Understanding Scopes and Collections

A _collection_ is a data container, defined on Couchbase Server, within a bucket whose type is either _Couchbase_ or _Ephemeral_.
Up to 1000 collections can be created per bucket.
Bucket-items can optionally be assigned to different collections according to content-type.
For example, within a bucket that contains travel information, documents that relate specifically to _airports_ might be assigned to an _airports_ collection, while documents that relate to _hotels_ might be assigned to a _hotels_ collection, and so on.

A _scope_ is a mechanism for the grouping of multiple collections.
Up to 100 scopes can be created per bucket. Collection-names must be unique within their scope.
Collections might be assigned to different scopes according to content-type, or to deployment-phase (ie, test versus production). Applications can be assigned per-scope access-rights; allowing each application to access only those collections it requires.

[#naming-for-scopes-and-collection]
== Naming for Scopes and Collections

User-defined scopes and collections must be assigned user-defined names.
Such names:

* Must be between 1 and 30 characters in length.
* Can only contain the characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and the symbols `_`, `-`, and `%`.
* Cannot start with `_` or `%`.

[#default-scope-and-collection]
== Default Scope and Collection

Every created bucket is automatically given a _default scope_, and within it, a _default collection_.
Each is named `_default`.
All documents created within the bucket without reference to specific scopes or collections are saved in the default collection, within the default scope.
The default scope and collection cannot be dropped.

[#managing-scopes-and-collections]
== Managing Scopes and Collections

See xref:manage:manage-scopes-and-collections/manage-scopes-and-collections.adoc[Manage Scopes and Collections], for information on how to use the CLI and REST API to create, maintain, and delete scopes and collections.

For examples of using the REST API, see xref:developer-preview:collections/manage-collections-with-rest.adoc[Collections via REST].

For examples of using the CLI, see xref:developer-preview:collections/manage-collections-with-cli.adoc[Collections via CLI].

For the REST reference pages for collections, see xref:developer-preview:collections/collections-rest-api-reference.adoc[REST API Reference].

For the `cbstats` reference pages for collections, see xref:developer-preview:collections/collections-cbstats-reference.adoc[cbstats Reference].

[#working-with-collections-from-couchbase-sdks]
== Working with Scopes and Collections from Couchbase SDKs

The 3.0 API versions of Couchbase SDKs work with scopes and collections.
For information, see the xref:3.0@java-sdk:howtos:working-with-collections.adoc[Java Howto doc].
