== Creating, Maintaining, and Accessing Data

Couchbase Server keeps items in _Buckets_. Before an item can be saved, a bucket must exist for it.
Buckets can be created by means of the _Couchbase Web Console_, the xref:rest-api:rest-intro.adoc[_REST API_] or the _CLI_.
Each bucket is assigned a name at its creation: this name is referenced by the application or user wishing to save or access items within it.

The types of bucket most frequently used are _Couchbase_ and _Ephemeral_ buckets.
_Couchbase_ buckets exist both in memory and on disk. _Ephemeral_ buckets exist only in memory.
Buckets can be configured to maintain data in compressed format, so as to maximize resource-effectiveness. Documents within a bucket can be assigned a _Time To Live_, to ensure that they expire after a specified time-period, and that their data is thus made permanently inaccessible.

Couchbase Server manages memory to ensure high performance and scalability: memory quotas are established, and data not recently used can be _ejected_, to make room for data more frequently requested. Multi-threaded readers and writers provide simultaneous read and write operations for data on disk, ensuring high throughput.

The pages in this section provide detailed descriptions of buckets, memory, and storage.
