== Understanding System Events

_System events_ are generated to record significant occurrences on the cluster.
Events are provided for the Cluster Manager, the Data Service, the Index Service, the Search Service, the Eventing Service, the Backup Service, and the Analytics Service.
Events are also generated for XDCR, security, and Views.

Each event is provided as a JSON document containing a number of key-value pairs: some key-value pairs are included in all system events, others are specific to the service for which the event is generated.
Each key-value pair provides definitive information on the event.

Each system event for a given service is of a certain _type_; and this is indicated by key-value pairs that respectively provide an _ID_ and a _description_.
Additionally, each event-type is considered to be at a particular level of _severity_: supported levels are _info_, _warn_, _error_, and _fatal_.

The goal of system-event generation is to provide users with a clear account of what occurs on the cluster: however, system events are not intended to provide detailed, diagnostic information (regarding which, see the reference to xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/system-events.adoc#logging[Logging], provided below).

System events are recorded in a _system log_, which is maintained by the Cluster Manager.
Each node in the cluster has a copy of the system log; and each log is kept up to date by means of _gossip replication_ between the nodes.
(See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/metadata-management.adoc[Metadata Management], for information on gossip replication.)
The default number of systems logs stored is 10k -- the log is rotated by the Cluster Manager.
Note that the size can be modified: the smallest possible value is 3k, the highest is 20k.
Retrieval and modification of the current size are accomplished by means of the `/internalSettings` endpoint: for examples, see xref:rest-api:rest-get-internal-setting.adoc[Managing Internal Settings].
Note also that the current size can only be changed when all cluster-nodes are running Couchbase Server Version 7.1 or higher.

System events do not need to be explicitly enabled by the administrator: they are collected by default, and can be retrieved by the administrator as required.
Retrieval is accomplished by means of the REST API, two methods of retrieval being supported:

* _Batch_ retrieval.
Either all events or a specified number are retrieved in a single array, either from the beginning of the system log or from a specified time.

* _Dynamic retrieval_.
Each event is returned as it happens.

For detailed information on the REST API for system events, see xref:rest-api:rest-get-system-events.adoc[Getting System Events].

Note that system events are different from, and should not be confused with, two other facilities provided by Couchbase Server:

* _Auditing_.
Audit events are generated by Couchbase Server to maintain a record of security-related occurrences across the cluster.
Auditing must be specifically enabled by the administrator.
Audit events can be _filtered_, so that only a desirable subset is generated.
For information, see xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].

[#logging]
* _Logging_.
This provides a series of _per node_ log files, the content for each of which is periodically incremented by a particular service or process, to maintain an account of occurrences and results.
Logging allows detailed system diagnostics to be performed.
For information, see xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[Manage Logging].



== System-Event Structure

Every system event always contains the following fields.

[options="header", cols="2,2,7"]
|===

| Field | Value Type | Description

| timestamp | string | Date and time of the event in UTC iso-8601 format, which is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss:SSSZ`.
For more information, see https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[Date and Time Formats^].

| component | string | Name of the service generating the event.
This can be `ns_server`, `query`, `indexing`, `search`, `eventing`, `analytics`, `backup`, `xdcr`, `data`, `security`, or `views`.

| severity | string | The degree of significance of the type of occurrence.
This can be `info`, `warn`, `error`, or `fatal`.

| id | unsigned integer | The identifier for the type of occurrence.
For example, whenever a bucket is created, the Data Service generates a `Bucket created` event, whose id `8192`.

| description | string | The description of the type of occurrence.
For example, whenever a bucket is created, the Data Service generates an event whose description is `Bucket created`.

| uuid | string | A universally unique identifier provided for each specific instance of an occurrence-type.
For example, if two buckets are created, two `Bucket created` events are generated by the Data Service, both with the id `8192`, and each with its own uuid.

|===

Note that all system events contain additional fields that are specific to the service that is generating the event.
Examples of system-event structure can be found in the REST API reference page, xref:rest-api:rest-get-system-events.adoc[Getting System Events].


== System Events and Upgrade

System-event provision is supported only when every node in the cluster is running a version of Couchbase Server that is 7.1 or later.
If any node is running a version that is less than 7.1, any attempt to return system events returns the message `Not found`.

== Returning System Events

System events can be returned by means of the REST API.
For information, see xref:rest-api:rest-get-system-events.adoc[Getting System Events].
In Couchbase Server 7.1, system events cannot be returned by means either of the CLI or the UI.
