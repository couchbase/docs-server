[abstract]
XDCR Advanced Filtering allows specified subsets of documents to be replicated from the source bucket.

== Configuring XDCR Filtering

Full, Cluster, and XDCR Administrators can configure XDCR filtering.

The _filtering expression_ is a regular expression that is applied on the source cluster to documents' keys, values, and metadata: documents that provide a match are replicated to the target; other documents are _not_ replicated.

Multiple filtering expressions can be used by a single replication: the expressions should be `ORed`, as follows: `filterExpression0|filterExpression1`.
For example, the expression `airline|hotel` would match both `unitedairline` and `marriothotel`.

Filtering is established when a replication is created, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, CLI, or REST API.
Once established, the filtering expression for a replication cannot be modified: the replication must be deleted, and a new replication created.

Filtering does not impact conflict resolution and can be used with either the _revision-based_ or the _timestamp-based_ conflict resolution policy.
Filtering does not affect the ability to pause and resume replications.
When multiple filtered replications are being established from the same source, expressions should typically be defined so as avoid the unnecessary replication of individual documents to multiple targets.
