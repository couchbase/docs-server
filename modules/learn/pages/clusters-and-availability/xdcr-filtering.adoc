== Understanding XDCR Advanced Filtering

_XDCR filtering_ allows a document to be included in or excluded from a filtered replication, based on the document's fields and values.

XDCR applies the filter during replication processing, as the data is passed through the replication pipeline.
Filter-evaluation is performed only in the following circumstances:

* A document is either created or modified.

* A replication is restarted for all documents.

Note that filter-evaluation is _not_ performed based on the measurement of elapsed time: therefore, the replication of a document cannot be triggered by establishing a filter on a date time value within the document.
For example, a filter that associates a future date time, specified as a numeric value, with a key named `expiration_time` does _not_ trigger replication when the specified date time is reached.

Case-sensitive matches can be made on:

* _id_ and _xattrs_ values, within the document's _metadata_.

* Field-names and values, within the document's _data_, nested to any degree.

Every document on which a match is successfully made is included in the filtered replication.
Other documents are _not_ included.

Match-requirements are specified by means of:

* _Regular Expressions_.
These can be used to specify case-sensitive character-matches, and thereby determine whether a field-name or value may entitle a document to be included in a replication.
See the reference information provided in xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-regular-expressions.adoc[XDCR Regular Expressions].

* _Filtering Expressions_.
These allow comparisons and calculations to be made on the fields and values identified by means of _regular_ expressions: based on the results, a document either is or is not included in a replication.
See the reference information provided in
xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-expressions.adoc[XDCR Filtering Expressions].

Note that fields and values on which matches are to be made should typically be kept immutable.
If the fields or values of a given document are changed after a replication has started (see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc#filter-expression-editing[Filter-Expression Editing], below), such a document may no longer meet the criterion for replication, and so go unreplicated in its new form &#8212; and yet may already reside in its _previous_ form on the target cluster; since it formerly met the criterion, and was duly replicated.
In consequence, a single document would be maintained with a different value on each cluster.

This page explains XDCR Advanced Filtering at a conceptual level.
For the practical steps involved, see xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc[Filter a Replication].

[#xdcr-advanced-filtering-with-scopes-and-collections]
=== XDCR Advanced Filtering with Scopes and Collections

One filter can be applied per replication: this filter therefore affects all mappings between scopes and collections, whether implicit or explicit.
The examples on this page show replications as extending from source bucket to target bucket: all mappings between source and target collections within these buckets should be understood to have the single filter applied to them.
For more information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc[XDCR with Scopes and Collections].

Note that in the special case of _migration_, multiple filters _can_ be applied, each to one of multiple mappings: however, migration is intended only for the special case where data is initially established in newly created scopes and collections.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-with-scopes-and-collections.adoc#migration[Migration], for more information.

== No Filter Applied

When no filter is applied, all documents in the specified source bucket are replicated to the specified target bucket.
For example:

.Replication with no filter applied
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-1-v3.png[,720,align=left]

The replication _R_ specifies as its source _Source Bucket_, on the _Source Cluster_; and specifies as its target _Target Bucket_, on the _Target Cluster_.
The replication specifies no filter.

When it starts, the replication examines the documents in the source bucket, which are `airline_10` and `airport_8835`.
Since no filter is applied, both documents are suitable for replication, and are duly replicated to the _Target Bucket_.

== Filter Applied

When a filter is applied, on those documents whose fields or values provide a successful match are included in the replication.
For example:

.Replication with filter applied
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-2-v2.png[,720,align=left]

The replication  _R_ specifies as its source _Source Bucket_, on the _Source Cluster_; and specifies as its target _Target Bucket_, on the _Target Cluster_.
The replication specifies a filter: this requires that a document have a `type` field, whose value is a string that contains the substring `air`, and that this be followed by the substring `l`.
For details on this kind of expression (referred to as _positive lookahead_), see the reference provided for xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-expressions.adoc[XDCR Filtering Expressions].

When it starts, the replication examines the documents in the source bucket.
The document `airline_10` has a `type` field whose value provides a successful match; therefore, the document is replicated.
The document `airport_8835` does have a `type` field, but its value does not contain a string that provides a successful match; therefore, the document is _not_ replicated.

== Multiple Filters Applied

To support replication, _multiple filters_ can be applied in either of two ways:

* By means of ORing, within a single replication.
This allows a document to be replicated if any one of the specified filters makes a successful match.
For information, see the xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-filtering-reference-intro.adoc[XDCR Advanced Filtering Reference].

* By means of individual or multiple ORed filters, specified across multiple replications.
For example:

.Replication with multiple filters applied simultaneously
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-3a-v2.png[,720,align=left]

The replication  _R1_ specifies as its source _Source Bucket_, on the _Source Cluster_; and specifies as its target _Target Bucket 1_, on the _Target Cluster 1_.
The replication specifies a filter: as in the previous example, this requires that a document have a `type` field, whose value is a string that contains the substring `air`, and that this be followed by the substring `l`.

When it starts, the replication examines the documents in the source bucket.
The document `airline_10` has a `type` field whose value provides a successful match; therefore, the document is replicated to _Target Bucket 1_.
The document `airport_8835` does have a `type` field, but its value does not contain a string that provides a successful match; therefore, the document is _not_ replicated.

As _R1_, the replication _R2_ specifies as its source _Source Bucket_, on the _Source Cluster_.
However, it specifies as its target _Target Bucket 2_, on the _Target Cluster 2_.
The replication specifies a filter: this requires that a document have a `type` field, whose value is a string that contains the substring `air`, and that this be followed by the substring `p`.

The document `airport_8835` has a `type` field whose value provides a successful match; therefore, the document is replicated to _Target Bucket 2_.
The document `airline_10` does have a `type` field, but its value does not contain a string that provides a successful match; therefore, the document is _not_ replicated.

Thus, each of the two documents in the source is replicated to one, distinct target bucket, on its own target cluster.
Note that many variants of this example can be designed; including replicated the contents of a single source bucket to multiple target buckets on a single target cluster.

[#filter-expression-editing]
== Filter-Expression Editing

The filter-expressions defined for a particular replication can be edited after their initial definition and use.
This allows a single replication to employ multiple different filters and filter-combinations, sequentially.

Note that once a document has been replicated, it can only be removed from the target by being removed from the source.
Therefore, if a replication's filter-expression is changed, although it changes the criterion whereby documents are to be replicated in future, it does not affect the presence on those documents already replicated to the target according to the old criterion.
If the intention is to populate the target _only_ with documents that meet the new criterion, those documents on the target that do not meet the criterion must either be manually removed, or removed by means of _flushing_: see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-bucket-flush[XDCR Bucket Flush], for details.

Note also that a replication only prepares to replicate all documents in the source bucket during its _initial process_; and afterwards, only considers _mutations_ as candidates for replication.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc#xdcr-process[XDCR Process], for details.
Two options are therefore made available, whereby the continuance of a replication can be configured, following the editing of a filter-expression:

* _Restart_.
The current instance of the replication is ended, and a new instance is started, with the new filtering criterion.
This causes a new running of the replication's _initial process_, whereby all documents in the source bucket are examined.
In consequence, documents that already meet the new filtering criterion, but were not replicated according to the old filtering criterion, and have not been mutated, are determined to be candidates for replication.
This is the default.

* _Continue_.
The current instance of the replication continues, with the new filtering criterion.
The replication's _initial process_ is _not_ re-run.
Therefore, documents that already meet the new filtering criterion, but were not replicated according to the old filtering criterion, and have not been mutated, are _not_ replicated &#8212; unless they are mutated subsequently.

For example, it might be desirable to modify the replication shown above in Figure 2 &#8212; which searches for the string `air`, followed by the string `l` &#8212; without deleting and recreating the replication.
The possible results are shown below.

=== Restart

In the following illustration, the filter-expression used in Figure 2 is changed, to search for the string `air`, followed by the string `p`.
The _restart_ option is specified.

.Filter-expression edited, with restart option
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-5-v5.png[,720,align=left]

In its original version, _R1_, the replication had identified, during its _initial process_, the document `airline_10`, which was duly replicated to the target bucket.
The original filter-expression is edited, so that the replication becomes _R1a_; and the replication is restarted.
During its _initial process_, it examines all documents in the source bucket; finding no match on `airline_10`, but finding a match on `airport_8835`, which is duly replicated to the target bucket.

Subsequently, _R1a_ will examine all mutations, and will replicate those on which it achieves a successful match.

=== Continue

In the following illustration, the filter-expression used in Figure 2 is again changed to search for the string `air`, followed by the string `p`.
This time, the _continue_ option is specified.

.Filter-expression edited, with continue option
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-6-v5.png[,720,align=left]

In its original version, _R1_, the replication had identified, during its _initial process_, the document `airline_10`, which was duly replicated to the target bucket.
The original filter-expression is edited, so that the replication becomes _R1a_; and the replication is continued.
There is no repetition of the _initial process_: therefore, the existing documents `airline_10` and `airport_8835` are not re-examined; and no replication occurs.

Subsequently, _R1a_ will examine all mutations, and will replicate those on which it achieves a successful match.
This is illustrated as follows:

.Mutation recognized with continue option
image::xdcr/filter-replication-diagram-7-v6.png[,720,align=left]

The new document `airline_8838` is added the source bucket, and is examined by _R1a_.
A successful match is made, and `airline_8838` is duly replicated to the target bucket.

[#using-deletion-filters]
== Using Deletion Filters

_Deletion filters_ control whether the deletion of a document at source causes deletion of a replica document that exists on the replication-target.
For the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#deletion-filters[UI] each filter is selected by means of a checkbox.
For the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[CLI] and xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[REST API], parameter-values must be specified.

Examples of filtering are provided in xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc[Filter a Replication].

=== Deletion-Filter Types

Deletion filters are of three types, and control the following.

==== Replication of Expirations

Configured through the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#deletion-filters[UI] with the *Do not replicate document expirations* checkbox; through the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[CLI] with the `filter-expiration` flag; and through the xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[REST API] with the `filterExpiration` flag.
Selecting this option means that if, having been replicated, the document at source expires and is deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, if this option is not selected or left `false` (which are the defaults), expirations at source are replicated; meaning that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

==== Replication of Deletions

Configured through the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#deletion-filters[UI] with the *Do not replicate DELETE operations* checkbox; through the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[CLI] with the `filter-deletion` flag; and through the xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[REST API] with the `filterDeletion` flag.
Selecting this option determines that if, having been replicated, the document at source is deleted, the replicated copy of the document will _not_ be deleted.
Conversely, leaving this option unselected or `false` (which are the defaults) replicates deletions that occur at source, meaning that the replicated copy of the document _will_ be deleted.

==== Replication of TTL

Configured through the xref:manage:manage-xdcr/filter-xdcr-replication.adoc#deletion-filters[UI] with the *Remove TTL from replicated items* checkbox; through the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-xdcr-replicate.adoc[CLI] with the `reset-expiry` flag; and with the xref:rest-api:rest-xdcr-create-replication.adoc[REST API] with the `filterBypassExpiry` flag.
Selecting this option determines that the TTL that a document bears at source is _not_ made part of the replicated copy of the document: instead, the TTL of the replicated copy is set to 0.
Conversely, if this option is not selected or left `false` (which are the defaults), the TTL is made part of the replicated copy of the document, and may thereby determine when the replicated copy of the document expires.
Note, however, that the TTL applied to the replicated document at the target may be that of either the collection or the bucket in which it resides: for information, see xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

=== Deletion Filters versus Filter Expressions

By default, any source-document deletion (or expiration) _is_ replicated to the target; resulting in a corresponding target-document deletion.
Note that such replication is _not_ prevented by the specifying of a filter that is formed with regular and other filtering expressions: such expressions only determine which non-deleted documents are to be replicated.
Therefore, to ensure that document-deletions (and expirations) are _not_ replicated, _deletion filters_ must specifically be configured.

=== Tombstones, DCP Events, and Replication

When a document is deleted or is expired, a tombstone is created.
Tombstones and their management are described in xref:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/storage.adoc#tombstones[Tombstones].
In order to replicate a deletion or an expiration, XDCR must be able to receive, on the source, a DCP event that corresponds to the creation of a tombstone for the deleted or expired document.
On receipt of the DCP event, XDCR generates its own, corresponding deletion or expiration event; and replicates this to the target.

However, in some instances, even if a tombstone has been created, XDCR may not receive the DCP event.
For example:

* A document is deleted and then immediately recreated, such that DCP interprets the tombstone to have been at once superseded by the recreated document; and so does not send an event.

* A replication is deleted; then, source documents are deleted or expired.
Tombstones are created; but no DCP event is sent to XDCR, since no replication exists.
Subsequently, the replication is recreated: the replication will from this point only receive DCP events that correspond to future deletions and expirations.
+
Note, however, that conversely, creation of a new replication in this way, if performed with greater immediacy, may indeed result in DCP sending events; and allow XDCR, in turn, to replicate deletion and expiration events to the target.

=== Expiration, TTL, and Replication

TTL can be established on individual documents, on collections, and on buckets.
The relationship between these settings, and the way the setting on an individual document is resolved when replicated to the target, is fully described in xref:learn:data/expiration.adoc[Expiration].

When a deletion or expiration event is replicated to the target, the replica-document at the target is deleted or expired irrespective of its current TTL.
Thus, the replica-document's TTL may have been modified on the target, such that it specifies expiration at a later point in time than that specified by the TTL of the source document: nevertheless, when the source document expires, an expiration event is replicated, and the replica-document on the target is immediately expired.

For more information, see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-filtering.adoc#configuring-deletion-filters-to-prevent-data-loss[Configuring Deletion Filters to Prevent Data-Loss], immediately below.

[#configuring-deletion-filters-to-prevent-data-loss]
=== Configuring Deletion Filters to Prevent Data-Loss

Appropriate deletion-filter settings protect data.
However, in certain circumstances, inappropriate deletion-filter settings may cause _loss_ of data.
For example:

. By means of replication _1_, documents of type _A_ and type _B_ are replicated to the target.

. Replication _1_ is deleted.

. Documents of type _A_ are deleted on the source; with the expectation that they will continue to exist on the target.

. Replication _2_ is created, with the default deletion-filter settings, so as to replicate to the target all future changes on the source to documents of type _B_.

Here, the (incorrectly) expected outcome has been that documents of both type _A_ and type _B_ continue to exist on the target.
However, since document-deletions are replicated by default, replication _2_ has deleted documents of type _A_ from the target; and the actual outcome is therefore that only documents of type _B_ exist on the target; with documents of type _A_ existing on neither source nor target.

To avoid this outcome, replication _2_ could be created with deletion filters configured to prevent the replication of deletions: the prior deletions of documents of type _A_ from the source would thereby _not_ be replicated to the target.
Note, however, that this would also prevent the replication of future source-deletions of type _B_ documents.

=== Configuring Deletion-Filters to Prevent Replication of Stale Data

In certain circumstances, inappropriate deletion-filter settings may allow _stale_ data to be inadvertently replicated to the target.
For example:

. A replication is established to replicate documents of type _A_ and type _B_ to the target.
Deletion-filter settings are configured to _prevent_ replication of deletions that occur on the source.

. After the replication has commenced, for reasons of security, documents of type _A_ are deleted from the source.

Here, the (incorrectly) expected outcome has been that security requirements have been complied with, since documents of type _A_ have been deleted from the source.
However, since deletion-filters have been configured _not_ to replicate deletions, documents of type _A_, subsequent to their replication, continue to exist on the target as _stale_ data; and do so in contravention of security requirements.

To avoid this outcome, the replication should be created with the default deletion-settings, so as to _permit_ the replication of deletions.
This ensures that deletions made on the source also occur on the target.

=== Deletion Filters and Migration

The appropriate configuring of deletion filters is critically important in cases of _migration_ where documents are being assigned to newly created collections, with their source collection (often the default collection of a legacy bucket) intended subsequently to be dropped.
For example, the following sequence results in loss of data:

. The default collection of a legacy bucket is determined to contain only documents that are either of type _A_ or of type _B_.

. Migration is configured to replicate documents of type _A_ from the source, default collection to a new, target collection, named _A_; and documents of type _B_ to another new, target collection, named _B_.
Deletion filters are left at their default settings.

. Migration proceeds.
Eventually, all type _A_ documents exist both in the source collection, and in the new, target collection _A_; and all type _B_ documents exist both in the source collection, and in the new, target collection _B_.

. The source, default collection is dropped; and all its data thereby deleted.

Here, the (incorrectly) expected result has been that all documents will continue to exist; in the new, target collections, _A_ and _B_.
However, since the migration was not deleted prior to the deletion of the source data, and since the default settings of the deletion filters specified that document-deletions should be replicated; the actual result is that all documents from the target collections _A_ and _B_ have been deleted, along with the source, default collection, and all its data.

==== Guarding Against Accidental Data-Loss during Migration

Either of the following approaches can be used to ensure that no migrated data is lost:

* Configure deletion filters to prohibit the replication of deletions and/or expirations.
This ensures that only documents and their mutations are replicated to their new collection.
+
Note, however, that if read-write application-access continues to be granted to the source collection during the life of the migration, application-deletions and/or expirations that occur on the source are not replicated to the target collection; eventually rendering source and target collections inconsistent.

* Keep deletion filters at their default setting, to permit the replication of deletions and/or expirations.
When the migration is judged to have completed, delete the migration _prior to_ the deletion of any source data.
Then, once the migration is deleted, delete source data as appropriate.
+
Note that if a new replication is subsequently created between the same source and target collections, with deletion filters configured to permit the replication of deletions and/or expirations, the deletions and/or expirations will be replicated to the target if the tombstones produced by the source-data deletions and/or expirations have not yet been purged.

Note that before and during migration, both the xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc[Backup Service] and xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr] can be used to protect data.
