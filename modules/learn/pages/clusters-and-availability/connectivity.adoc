[abstract]
Couchbase Server handles client to cluster, node to node, and cluster to cluster communications.
It also provides connectivity to a number of third-party products.

== Client to Cluster

Client applications communicate with a Couchbase Server-cluster through a set of server-defined access-points, each of which provides ports for both clear and encrypted communication.

The principal access-points for clients are as follows:

[cols="4,6,10,13"]
|===
| Type | Port | API | Description

| REST
| 8091, 18091 (SSL)
| REST API administrative operations
| Direct connection to a single node in the cluster, to perform administrative operations, monitoring, and alerting; by means of the xref:rest-api:rest-intro.adoc[REST API].

| ONLINE
| 11210, 11207 (SSL)
| Core Data operations
| Stateful connections from a client to cluster-nodes running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data Service] for CRUD operations.

| REST
| 8093, 18093 (SSL)
| Query with N1QL API
| Load-balanced connection across cluster-nodes running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/query-service.adoc[Query Service] for xref:java-sdk::n1ql-query.adoc[N1QL] queries.

| REST
| 8094, 18094 (SSL)
| Search Service
| Load-balanced connections across cluster-nodes running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/search-service.adoc[Search Service] for xref:fts:full-text-intro.adoc[Full Text Search] queries.

| REST
| 8095, 18095 (SSL)
| Analytics Service
| Load-balanced connections across cluster-nodes running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/analytics-service.adoc[Analytics Service].

| REST
| 8092, 18092 (SSL)
| Query with View API
| Load-balanced connection across cluster-nodes running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data Service] for xref:views/views-intro.adoc[View] queries.
|===

Note that the above table lists only a subset of Couchbase Server network ports.
For a complete list, see xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements].

== Node to Node

Cluster-nodes intercommunicate in order to replicate data, maintain indexes, check the health of nodes, communicate changes to the cluster-configuration, and more.
See xref:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager], for detailed information.

== Cluster to Cluster

Couchbase Server-clusters communicate with one another by means of _Cross Datacenter Replication_ (XDCR).
See xref:clusters-and-availability/replication-architecture.adoc[Availability], for detailed information.

== Cluster to Connector

Couchbase Server-clusters communicate with third party products; by means of _connectors_.
Connectors are provided for _Elasticsearch_, _Hadoop_, _Kafka_, _Spark_, and _Talend_.
Drivers are provided for _ODBC_ and _JDBC_.
See xref:connectors:intro.adoc[Connector Guides], for detailed information.

[#connectivity-phases]
== Connectivity Phases

Client connectivity is established in three phases: _Authentication and Authorization_, _Discovery_, and _Service Connection_.

. _Authentication and Authorization_: The client authenticates with _username_ and _password_.
If these are associated with a Couchbase-Server defined _role_, itself associated with appropriate privileges on the resource access to which is being requested, the client is authorized, and access is granted.
Otherwise, access is denied.
See
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization] for details.
. _Discovery_: A cluster-map is returned to the client.
This indicates the current cluster-topology; including the list of nodes, the data-distribution across the nodes, and the service-distribution accross the nodes.
. _Service Connection_: Once in possession of the cluster-map, the client determines the connections needed to establish and perform service-level operations.
Additional authorizations may be required, depending on the operations being attempted.
Note that in the event of topology-changes, a service connection-request may result in an exception; in which case discovery must be re-run, and operations retried with new connections.
