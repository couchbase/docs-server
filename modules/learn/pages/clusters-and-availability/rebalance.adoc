[abstract]
_Rebalance_ redistributes data and indexes among available nodes.

[#understanding-rebalance]
== Understanding Rebalance

When one or more nodes have been _brought into_ a cluster (either by xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-addition[adding] or xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc#node-joining[joining]), or have been _taken out_ of a cluster (either through xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/removal.adoc[Removal] or xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/failover.adoc[Failover]), _rebalance_ redistributes data and indexes among available nodes.
The _cluster map_ is correspondingly updated and distributed to clients.
The process occurs while the cluster continues to service requests for data.

See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager], for information on the cluster map.
See xref:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[Manage Nodes and Clusters], for practical examples of using rebalance.

[#rebalance-stages]
== Rebalance Stages

Each rebalance proceeds in sequential _stages_.
Each stage corresponds to a Couchbase Service, deployed on the cluster.
Therefore, if all services have been deployed, there are _six_ stages in all &#8212; one each for the _Data_, _Query_, _Index_, _Search_, _Eventing_, and _Analytics_ services.
When all stages have been completed, the rebalance process itself is complete.

[#rebalancing-the-data-service]
== Rebalance and the Data Service

On rebalance, vBuckets are redistributed evenly among currently available Data Service nodes.
After rebalance, operations are directed to active vBuckets in their updated locations.
Rebalance does not interrupt applications' data-access.
vBucket data-transfer occurs sequentially: therefore, if rebalance stops for any reason, it can be restarted from the point at which it was stopped.

Note the special case provided by xref:install:upgrade-online.adoc#swap-rebalance-example[Swap Rebalance], where the number of nodes coming into the cluster is equal to the number of nodes leaving the cluster, ensuring that data is only moved between these nodes.

If nodes have been removed such that the desired number of replicas can no longer be supported, rebalance provides as many replicas as possible.
For example, if four Data Service nodes previously supported one bucket with three replicas, and the Data Service node-count is reduced to three, rebalance provides two replicas only.
If and when the missing Data Service node is restored or replaced, rebalance will provide three replicas again.

See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/intra-cluster-replication.adoc[Intra-Cluster Replication], for information on how data is distributed across nodes.

[#data-service-rebalance-stages]
=== Data-Service Rebalance Substages

During the Data Service rebalance stage, vBuckets are moved in _substages_.
The substages &#8212; which differ, depending on whether the vBucket is an _active_ or a _replica_ vBucket &#8212; are described below.

[#rebalance-stages-for-replica-vbuckets]
==== Rebalance Substages for Replica vBuckets

The substages through which rebalance moves a replica vBucket are shown by the following illustration.

image::clusters-and-availability/replicaVbucketMove.png[,640,align=left]

The move has two principal substages. Substage 1 is _Backfill_. Substage 2 is _Book-keeping_.

Substage 1, _Backfill_, itself consists of two phases.
The first comprises the movement of the replica vBucket data from its node of origin to the memory of the destination node.
The second comprises the writing of the replica vBucket data from the memory to the disk of the destination node.
The time required for this second phase, which only applies to Couchbase Buckets, is termed _Persistence Time_.
The time required for the entire _Backfill_ process, including _Persistence Time_, is termed _Backfill Time_.

Substage 2, _Book-keeping_, comprises various ancillary tasks required for move-completion.

The total time required for the move is calculated by adding _Backfill Time_ to the time required for Substage 2, _Book-keeping_; and is termed _Move Time_.

[#rebalance-stages-for-active-vbuckets]
==== Rebalance Substages for Active vBuckets

The substages in which rebalance moves an active vBucket are shown by the following illustration.

image::clusters-and-availability/activeVbucketMove.png[,780,align=left]

The move has four principal substages.
Substage 1, _Backfill_, and Substage 2, _Book-keeping_, are identical to those required for replica vBuckets; except that the _Book-keeping_ phase includes additional _Persistence Time_.

Substage 3, _Active Takeover_, comprises the operations required to establish the relocated vBucket as the new active copy.
The time required for Substage 3 is termed _Takeover Time_.

Substage 4, _Book-keeping_, comprises a final set of ancillary tasks, required for move-completion.

The total time for the move is termed _Move Time_.

[#rebalance-reporting]
=== Accessing Rebalance Reports

Couchbase Server creates a _report_ on every rebalance that occurs.
The report contains a JSON document, which can be inspected in any browser or editor.
The document provides summaries of the concluded rebalance activity, as well as details for each of the vBuckets affected: in consequence, the report may be of considerable length.

On conclusion of the rebalance, the report can be accessed in any of the following ways:

* By means of Couchbase Web Console, as described in xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance].

* By means of the REST API, as described in xref:rest-api:rest-get-cluster-tasks.adoc[Getting Cluster Tasks].

* By accessing the directory `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/reblance` on _any_ of the cluster nodes.
Each successive rebalance report is provided as a `*.json` file, whose name indicates the time at which the report was run &#8212; for example, `rebalance_report_2020-03-17T11:10:17Z.json`.

A complete account of the report-content is provided in the xref:rebalance-reference:rebalance-reference.adoc[Rebalance Reference].

[#rebalance-and-other-services]
== Rebalance and Other Services

Rebalance affects different services differently.
The effects on services other than the Data Service are described below.

[#rebalancing-the-index-service]
=== Index Service

The Index Service maintains a cluster-wide set of index definitions and metadata, which allows the redistribution of indexes and index replicas from removed nodes to nodes that continue as part of the cluster.
Indexes that reside on non-removed nodes are unaffected by rebalance.

The rebalance process takes account of nodes' CPU and RAM utilization, and achieves the best resource-balance possible.
Note that rebalance does not _move_ indexes or replicas: instead, it _rebuilds_ them in their new locations, using the latest data from the Data Service.
If more index replicas exist than can be handled by the number of existing nodes, replicas are dropped: the numbers are automatically made up subsequently, if additional Index Service nodes are added to the cluster.

During rebalance, no index node is removed until index-building has completed on alternative nodes.
This ensures uninterrupted access to indexes.

[#rebalancing-the-search-service]
=== Search Service

The Search Service automatically partitions its indexes across all Search nodes in the cluster, ensuring that during rebalance, the distribution across all nodes is balanced.

[#rebalancing-the-query-service]
=== Query Service

The addition or removal of Query Service nodes during rebalance is immediately effective: an added node is immediately available to serve queries; while a removed node is immediately unavailable, such that ongoing queries are interrupted, requiring the handling of errors or timeouts at application-level.

[#rebalancing-the-eventing-service]
=== Eventing Service

When an Eventing Service node has been added or removed, rebalance causes _vBucket processing ownership_ to be redistributed among available Eventing Service nodes.
After rebalance, the service continues to process mutations: checkpoint information ensures that no mutations are lost.

[#rebalancing-the-analytics-service]
=== Analytics Service

The Analytics Service uses _shadow data_, which is a single copy of a subset of the data maintained by the Data Service.
The shadow data is not replicated; however, its single copy is partitioned across all cluster nodes that run the Analytics Service.
If an Analytics node is permanently removed or replaced, all shadow data must be rebuilt, if and when the Analytics Service is restarted.

If no Analytics Service node has been removed or replaced, shadow data is not affected by rebalance.
In consequence of rebalance, the Analytics Service receives an updated _cluster map_, and continues to work with the modified vBucket-topology.

[#rebalance-failure-handling]
== Rebalance Failure-Handling

Rebalance failures can optionally be responded to automatically, with up to 3 _retries_.
The number of seconds required to elapse between retries can also be configured.
For information on configuration options, see xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General Settings].
For information on failure-notifications, and options for cancelling rebalance-retries, see xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc#automated-rebalance-failure-handling[Automated Rebalance Failure Handling].
