[#roles-and-privilages]
== Roles and Privileges

Couchbase _roles_ each have a fixed association with a set of one or more privileges.
Each privilege is associated with a resource.
Privileges are actions such as *Read*, *Write*, *Execute*, *Manage*, *Flush*, and *List*; or a combination of some or all of these.

Roles are of the following kinds:

* _Administative_: Associated with cluster-wide privileges.
Some of these roles are for administrators; who might manage cluster-configurations; or read statistics; or enforce security.
Others are for users and user-defined applications that require access to specific, cluster-wide resources.

* _Bucket_: Associated with bucket administration, collection management, and application access.
Roles in this category can each be applied to one, to multiple, or to all buckets on the cluster.

* _Data_, _Views_, and _XDCR_: Associated with the Data Service.
This includes the reading, writing, monitoring, backing-up, and restoring of data; the administration of Views; and the administration of _Cross Data-Center Replication_ (XDCR).

* _Other Services_: Roles for the administration of services other than the Data Service.
These roles are organized under the following categories: _Query & Index_, _Search_, _Analytics_, and _Backup_.
(_Eventing_ administration is covered within the _Administrative_ category.)

* _Mobile_: Associated with the administration of _Sync Gateway_.

When a user (meaning either an administrator or an application) attempts to access a resource, they must authenticate.
The roles and privileges associated with the user-credentials thereby presented are checked by Couchbase Server.
If the associated roles contain privileges that support the kind of access that is being attempted, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.

[#roles-in-relation-to-buckets]
=== Roles in Relaton to Buckets

All data within a bucket is contained within some collection, within some scope.
Permissions conveyed by bucket-related roles may be restricted in any of the following ways:

* By _Bucket_: Permissions apply to all data in the specified bucket: all scopes and collections are thus covered by the permissions.

* By _Bucket_ and _Scope_: Permissions apply only to the collections within the specified scope (or scopes), within the specified bucket.

* By _Bucket_, _Scope_, and _Collection_: Permissions apply only to the data within the specified collection (or collections), within the specified scope (or scopes), within the specified bucket.

For detailed information on scopes and collections, see xref:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections].

[#commonly-used-roles]
=== Commonly Used Roles

Couchbase Server _users_ can largely be categorized as _administrators_, _developers_, and _applications_.
Each user-category is supported by a different subset of roles.

* _Administrators_.
Able to log into Couchbase Web Console and perform administrative tasks; but unable to read or write data.
+
The administrative tasks available are divided into multiple `admin` roles.
For example, the *Cluster Admin* role allows the management of all cluster features except security; while the *Read-Only Admin* role allows only the reading of statistics; and the *Bucket Admin* role allows management only of one or more buckets.
See the *Admin* roles listed below for full details.
Note that depending on the administrator's assigned roles, the content of Couchbase Web Console changes: for example, the entire *Security* screen is only visible to *Full Admin* administrators; and to administrators who possess both the *Local User Security Admin* and the *External User Security Admin* roles.

* _Applications_.
Able to read or write data; but unable to log into Couchbase Web Console, or in any way modify cluster-settings.
For example, the *Data Reader* and *Data Writer* roles allows data to be respectively read and written to one or more collections, within one or more scopes, within one or more buckets.
Other application-intended roles are *Application Access*, *Data DCP Writer*, *Data Backup & Restore*, and *Data Monitor*.
See below for details on each.

* _Developers_.
Can be given a selection of roles, allowing the right degree of data and console access.
For example, the *Read-Only Admin* role allows the reading of cluster-statistics, while the *Data Read* and *Data Write* roles allow access to data on one or more buckets.

The following list contains all roles supported by Couchbase Server, _Enterprise Edition_.
Each role is explained by means of a description and (in most cases) a table: the table lists the privileges in association with resources.
The header of each table states the role's *name*, followed by its _alias name_ in parentheses: alias names are used in commands and queries.
In each table-body, where a privilege is associated with a resource, this is indicated with a check-mark.
Where a privilege is not associated with a resource (or where association would not be applicable), this is indicated with a cross.
Resources not referred to in a particular table have no privileges associated with them in the context of the role being described.

Note that some roles grant access to Couchbase Web Console; while others do not.
The set of features displayed within the console varies, according to role.

Note also that any authentication failure will be logged in the log file for the resource on which access was attempted.
See xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[Manage Logging], for detailed information on using log files.

[#full-admin]
== Full Admin

The *Full Admin* role (an _Administrative_ role) supports full access to all Couchbase-Server features and resources, including those of security.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console, and allows the reading and writing of bucket-data.

This role is also available in Couchbase Server _Community Edition_.

[#cluster-admin]
== Cluster Admin

The *Cluster Admin* role (an _Administrative_ role) allows the management of all cluster features except security.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console, but does not permit the writing of data.

[#local-user-security-admin]
== Local User Security Admin

The *Local User Security Admin* role (an _Administrative_ role) allows the management of local user roles and the reading of all cluster statistics.
The role does not permit the granting of the *Full Admin*, the *Read-Only Admin*, the *Local User Security Admin*, or the *External User Security Admin* role; and does not permit the administrator to change their own role (which therefore remains *Local User Security Admin*).
The role supports access to Couchbase Web Console, but does not support the reading of data.

[#query-curl-access]
== Query Curl Access

The *Query Curl Access* role (a _Query & Index_ role) allows the N1QL CURL function to be executed by an externally authenticated user.
The user can access Couchbase Web Console, but cannot read data, other than that returned by the N1QL CURL function.

Note that the *Query Curl Access* role should be assigned with caution, since it entails risk: CURL runs within the local Couchbase Server network; therefore, the assignee of the *Query Curl Access* role is permitted to run GET and POST requests on the internal network, while being themselves externally located.

For an account of limitations on CURL, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/curl.adoc[CURL Function].

In versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.5, this role was referred to as *Query External Access*.

[#application-access]
== Application Access

The *Application Access* role (a _Bucket_ role) provides read and write access to data, _per bucket_.
The role does not allow access to Couchbase Web Console: it is intended for applications, rather than users.
Note that this role is also available in the _Community Edition_ of Couchbase Server.

The role is provided in support of buckets that were created on versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.0.
Such buckets were accessed by specifying _bucket-name_ and _bucket-password_: however, bucket-passwords are not recognized by Couchbase Server 5.0 and after.
Therefore, for each pre-existing bucket, the upgrade-process for 5.0 and after creates a new user, whose username is identical to the bucket-name; and whose password is identical to the former bucket-password, if one existed.
If no bucket-password existed, the user is created with no password.
This migration-process allows the same name-combination as before to be used in authentication.
To ensure backwards compatibility, each system-created user is assigned the [.ui]*Application Access* role, which authorizes the same read-write access to bucket-data as was granted before 5.0.

Use of the [.ui]*Application Access* role is deprecated for buckets created on Couchbase Server 5.0 and after: use the other bucket-access roles provided.
Note that in versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.5, this role was referred to as *Bucket Full Access*.
