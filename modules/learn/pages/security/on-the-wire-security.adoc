== Understanding On-the-Wire Security

The interfaces provided by Couchbase Server for configuring on-the-wire security apply to the following areas:

* _Accessing the UI provided by Couchbase Web Console_.
This can be disabled, for the whole cluster; over either HTTP or HTTPS, or over both.

* _Establishing the Cluster Encryption-Level_.
The level of encryption imposed on inter-node communications within the cluster can be configured.
This can be:

** `control`, meaning that server-management information passed between nodes is passed in encrypted form.

** `all`, meaning that all information passed between nodes, including data handled by services, is passed in encrypted form.

** `strict`, meaning `all` with only encrypted communication permitted between nodes and between the cluster and external clients.
Note, however, that after `strict` has been specified, communication that occurs entirely on a single node using the _loopback_ interface (whereby the machine is identified as either `::1` or `127.0.0.1`) is still permitted in non-encrypted form.
+
The cluster encryption-level can only be configured after cluster encryption itself has been _enabled_: see xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/node-to-node-encryption.adoc[Node-to-Node Encryption].
+
Before establishing the encryption-level as `strict`, see the information provided in xref:rest-api:rest-setting-security.adoc#enforcing-tls[Enforcing TLS].

* _Configuring TLS and Cipher-Suites_.
This includes establishing the server's minimum TLS version; determining whether the server's or the clients' cipher-order is used in a given communication; and configuring the list of cipher-suites that is accepted by the server.
These values can be configured either _globally_ (for the whole cluster), or on a _per service_ basis.
Details are provided immediately below.

* _Setting an HTTP Secure Transport Header (HSTS)_; so as to inform the Web-Console browser never to load a site using HTTP; and instead, to automatically convert all access-requests from HTTP to HTTPS.

* _Restricting Node-Addition_; by specifying a list of naming conventions that must be met by the name of any node that is to be added or joined to the cluster.
This feature is described in xref:rest-api:rest-specify-node-addition-conventions.adoc[Specify Naming Conventions for Node-Addition].

[#tls-and-cipher-suites]
== TLS and Cipher-Suites

_Transport Layer Security_ (TLS) is a protocol that provides security over a computer network.
Couchbase Server supports the configuration of TLS, to secure communications between cluster-nodes, clusters, and external clients: this includes selection of an appropriate TLS version.

TLS supports multiple methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message-integrity.
Appropriate methods, supported by both participants in an intended networked communication, can be specified through selection of an appropriate _cipher-suite_, from defined lists of ones acceptable.

When a TLS connection is established between a client application and Couchbase Server &#8212; for example, using the secure port `18091` &#8212; a _handshake_ occurs, as defined by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake[TLS Handshake Protocol^].
As part of this exchange, the client sends to the server the client's own cipher-suite list; which specifies the cipher-suites that the client itself supports.
A server-setting is provided to specify whether the server then conforms to its own or the client's preference, in selecting a commonly acceptable cipher-suite to be used for the communication.

Once the selection has been made by Couchbase Server, Couchbase Server notifies the client of the selection, and the handshake process continues.

[#configuring-tls-and-cipher-suites]
=== Configuring TLS and Cipher-Suites

Configuration for TLS and cipher-suites includes establishing the server's minimum TLS version; determining whether the server's or the clients' cipher-order is used in a given communication; and configuring the list of cipher-suites that is accepted by the server.
Such settings can be established either _globally_ (that is, for the entire cluster), or _per service_.
(Note that the other on-the-wire security settings &#8212; for _console-access_ and _encryption-level_ &#8212; are _global-only_; and _cannot_ be set for an individual service.)
A _service_ can be _any_ of the Couchbase Server xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services]; it can also be the xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager].

The relationships between _global_ and _per service_ settings for TLS and cipher-suites are described in the following subsections.

==== Establishing the Minimum TLS-Version

The minimum TLS version can be established either globally or per service: the server will not accept client connections with protocols below the level of the established, minimum version.

The minimum version can be established globally and for all services as `tlsv1`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2` or `tlsv1.3`.
However, see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc#cipher-suite-configuration-limitations[Cipher-Suite Configuration Limitations], below, for further information.

The cluster-wide default value for the minimum TLS version is `tlsv1.2`: this is used by a service if no value has been specified for that service, and no global value has been specified.

If a particular minimum TLS-version is specified for a given service, that service uses its specified value.
If no TLS-version has been specified for a given service, but a global value has been specified, the service uses the global value.

==== Establishing Cipher-Suite Preference

This determines, when secure communication is required between server and client, whether the cipher-suite list configured for the server is that to be used; or whether that configured for the client is to be used.
The server's preference is strongly recommended to be used, since secure: however, preference can be delegated to the client, if required.

The default value &#8212; both _globally_ and _per service_ &#8212; is that the server's preference is used: this, therefore, is the case if no cipher-suite preference value is specified either for a given service or globally.

If a particular cipher-suite preference value has been specified for a given service, the service uses that value.
If no cipher-suite preference value has been specified for a given service, and a value has been specified globally, the service uses the global value.

[#establishing-cipher-suite-lists]
==== Establishing Cipher-Suite Lists

Each service is pre-configured with a list of supported cipher-suites.
This list can be inspected as a _read-only_ value (see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc#get-cluster-wide-settings-with-the-cli[Get Cluster-Wide Settings, with the CLI], for an example).
Only those cipher-suites included in this list can be used by the service.

A _custom list_ of cipher-suites can be configured per service.
The custom list should be a subset of those cipher suites included in the pre-configured list of supported cipher-suites.
Any cipher-suites included in a per-service or global list that do not appear on the pre-configured list of supported cipher-suites for that service are ignored by the service.

A custom list of cipher-suites can also be configured globally.
The relationships between the per-service custom and pre-configured lists, and the global list, are as follows:

* If a custom list of cipher-suites is established for a given service, the service uses that list.

* If no custom list of cipher-suites is established for a given service, but a global list is established, the service uses the global list.

* If no custom list of cipher-suites is established for a given service, and no global list is established, the service uses a list of HIGH security cipher-suites.

There is no _global_, pre-configured list of supported cipher-suites.

Cipher-suites are used by a service in the order in which the cipher-suites appear in the list established for the service.
The order of cipher-suites in a custom list may be varied from that of the pre-configured list of supported cipher-suites for the service, except in the case of 1.3 cipher-suites: see xref:learn:security/on-the-wire-security.adoc#cipher-suite-configuration-limitations[Cipher-Suite Configuration Limitations], below, for information.

[#cipher-suite-configuration-limitations]
== Cipher-Suite Configuration Limitations

The following limitations apply to cipher-suite configuration.

[#tls-3-cipher-suite-limitations]
=== TLS 1.3 Cipher-Suite Limitations

As indicated above, TLS 1.3 cipher-suites can by used by all services; and by the Cluster Manager, XDCR, and Views.

However, only the _Cluster Manager_, the _Data Service_ and the _Analytics Service_ support the custom-configuration of TLS 1.3 ciphers &#8212; _custom-configuration_ of ciphers means the selection of a subset of available ciphers for a custom cipher-suite list, and the specifying of the selected ciphers in the subset in any order judged appropriate.

The remaining services and other components do _not_ support custom-configuration of TLS 1.3 ciphers.
This means that, for these services and components:

* A custom cipher-suite list will always implicitly include _all_ the TLS 1.3 cipher-suites in the list of supported cipher-suites for that service: none of those TLS 1.3 cipher-suites can be omitted.

* The order of the 1.3 cipher-suites is determined based on available hardware.

* If a client is able to use 1.3 cipher-suites, the service and client can communicate _only_ by means of one of the listed 1.3 cipher-suites.

[#tls-2-cipher-suite-limitation-with-http2]
=== TLS 1.2 Cipher-Suite Limitation with HTTP/2

If the HTTP/2 protocol is to be used with TLS 1.2, the cipher-suite `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` must be specified in any custom list.
If this cipher-suite is _not_ present, HTTP/1 or HTTP/1.1 are used, instead of HTTP/2.
For information, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.2.2[Section 9.2.2^] of the _Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)_.

Also, for information on cipher-suites prohibited by HTTP/2, see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#appendix-A[Appendix A^] of the same document.

== Establishing an HTTP Secure Transport Header

Setting an HTTP Secure Transport Header (HSTS) informs the Web-Console browser never to load a site using HTTP; and instead, to automatically convert all access-requests from HTTP to HTTPS. 
Only the _Strict-Transport-Security_ header is supported.

== Configuring On-the-Wire Security-Parameters

The parameters provided by Couchbase Server for on-the-wire security can be configured by means of either the CLI or the REST API.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-tls.adoc[Manage On-the-Wire Security], for information.
