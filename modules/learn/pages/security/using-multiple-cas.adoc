= Using Multiple Root CA Certificates
:description: Couchbase Server supports use of multiple root CA certificates, for a single cluster.

[abstract]
{description}

== Benefits

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, a Couchbase-Server cluster could maintain at most _one_ root CA: all nodes and all clients were obliged to rely on this CA's authority.
From version 7.1, Couchbase Server permits multiple root CAs to maintained in a _trust store_ for the cluster.
This:

* Allows an individual node either to use a root CA that is also used by one or more other nodes; or to use a root CA that is used by no other node.
This may be used to increase security: ensuring that a node can be successfully authenticated by some applications, but not by others.

* In cases where certificate-based client authentication is activated, allows a client to authenticate with reference to a CA that is not used in the signing of any node-certificate, but is nevertheless maintained in the cluster's trust store.
This may be used to offer administrators and developers greater flexibility, in terms of certificate-deployment; while maintaining optimal security.

All Root CAs in the trust store are accessible to all nodes, and multiple Root CAs may therefore be used in facilitating encrypted node-to-node communication.

== Illustration

A cluster-configuration that uses multiple Root CAs is illustrated as follows:

The diagram assumes that certificate-based client authentication has been activated.

The annotations are as follows:

. A Couchbase-Server cluster is configured with four nodes, access to each of which is certificate-protected.

. The trust store for the cluster contains ten root CAs, which are _CA a_ to _CA j_.
Of these, three root CAs have been used in the signing of individual node-certificates: these are _CA a, _CA e_, and _CA g_.

. The node-certificate for Node 1 is signed by an intermediate certificate, which has itself been signed by the root certifiate _CA a_.

. The node-certificate for Node 2 is signed by an intermediate certificate, which, like the intermediate certificate used by Node 1, has itself been signed by the root certificate _CA a_.

. The node-certificate for Node 3 has been directly signed by the root certificate _CA e_.

. The node-certificate for Node 4 has been signed by a chain of two intermediate certificates, the highest in the chain having itself been signed by the root CA _CA g_.

. The certificate for Client 1 has been signed by an intermediate certificate, which has been directly signed by the root certificate _CA a_: this is the CA providing authority to Node 1 and Node 2.
This allows mutual authentication to proceed between Node 1 and Client 1, since the certificate of each takes its authority from _CA a_.
(Note that this is the only form of certificate-based authentication that was supported by Couchbase Server, prior to version 7.1.)

. The certificate for Client 2 has been directly signed by the root certificate _CA h_.
Client 2 also maintains the root certificate _CA a_ in its trust store.
This allows mutual authentication to proceed between Node 2 and Client 2; since Client 2 recognizes the authority of _CA a_, and Node 1 recognizes the authority of _CA h_.
In each case, the recognized root CA exists in the entity's trust store, but has not played a role in the signing of the entity's own certificate.

. The certificate for Client 3 has been signed by an intermediate certificate, which has itself been signed by the root certificate _CA k_.
Client 3 also maintains _CA e_ in its trust store.
This prevents mutual authentication from occurring between Client 3 and Node 3: although the certificate for Node 3 acquires its authority from _CA e_, which is in the client's trust store, and is thus recognized by the client; the client's certificate is signed by _CA k_, which is not in the cluster's trust store, and is therefore not recognized by the cluster.

. The certificate for Client 4 is directly signed by _CA c_.
The client's trust store also contains _CA e_ and _CA g_.
This allows mutual authentication to succeed between Client 4 and Node 3, since the authority of each is derived from a root certificate in its opposite's trust store.
This also allows mutual authentication to succeed between Client 4 and Node 4, for the same reason.
