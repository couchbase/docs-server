= Using Multiple Root CA Certificates
:description: Couchbase Server supports use of multiple root CA certificates, for a single cluster.

== Benefits

Prior to Couchbase Server Version 7.1, a Couchbase-Server cluster could maintain at most _one_ root CA: all nodes and all clients were obliged to rely on this CA's authority.
From version 7.1, Couchbase Server permits multiple root CAs to maintained in a _trust store_ for the cluster.
This:

* Allows an individual node either to use a root CA that is also used by one or more other nodes; or to use a root CA that is used by no other node.
This may be used to ensure that a node can be successfully authenticated only by some applications, but not by others.

* Allows a client to authenticate with reference to a CA that is not used in the signing of any node-certificate, but is nevertheless maintained in the cluster's trust store.
This offers administrators and developers greater flexibility, in terms of certificate-deployment.

All Root CAs in the trust store are accessible to all nodes, and multiple Root CAs may therefore be used in facilitating encrypted node-to-node communication.

== Illustration

A cluster-configuration that uses multiple Root CAs is illustrated as follows:
