== Security Overview

Couchbase Server can be rendered highly secure, so as to preserve the privacy and integrity of data, and account for access-attempts. The security facilities provided cover:

* _Authentication_: All administrators, users, and applications (all formally considered _users_) must authenticate, in order to gain server-access.
Users can be authenticated by means of either the _local_ or an _external_ password-registry.
Authentication can be achieved by either passing credentials directly to the server, or by using a client certificate, in which the credentials are embedded. Connections can be secured by means of _SCRAM_ and _TLS_.
See xref:learn:security/authentication.adoc[Authentication].

* _Authorization_: Couchbase Server uses _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC), to associate users with specifically assigned _roles_, these themselves corresponding to system-defined _privileges_, which allow degrees of access to specific system-resources.
On authentication, a user's roles are determined: if they allow the form of system-access the user is attempting, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.
See xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

* _Auditing_: Actions performed on Couchbase Server can be _audited_.
This allows administrators to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately performed.
See xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].

* _Encryption_: Data is encoded such that it is non-readable, other than by authorized parties who possess the appropriate means of _decryption_.
Prior to decryption, therefore, encrypted data can be securely saved or transmitted.
This ensures the privacy of user-data, and the integrity of servers and their clients.
See xref:learn:security/encryption-overview.adoc[Encryption].

== How to Use This Section

This section provides a conceptual and architectural overview of Couchbase Server security: this includes a list of _roles_ and _resources_; an account of available auditing options and audit-file contents; and a description of required keys, best practices, supported identity encodings, and other details related to certificates.
For practical steps whereby Couchbase Server can be secured, see the section xref:manage:manage-security/security-management-overview.adoc[Security Management Overview].
