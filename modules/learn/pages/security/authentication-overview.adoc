:description: pass:q[To access Couchbase Server, users must be authenticated. \
_Authentication_ is a process for identifying who is attempting to access a system.]

[abstract]
{description}
Subsequent to successful authentication, _authorization_ can be performed, whereby the user's appropriate access-level is determined.

[#passing-credentials]
== Authentication Options

Couchbase-Server authentication typically relies on a _username_ and a _password_, which must be passed into the system by the _user_ (meaning, the administrator or application) that is attempting access.
The specified username and password must match ones already defined: these must be accessible either on the Couchbase-Server cluster itself, or _externally_.
External accessibility, which is available only with the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, means either:

* On a network-accessible directory-server, by means of the _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP).

* By means of the _Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) authentication-framework.

If a match is achieved, the user is thereby recognized, and so _may_ be granted access.
If no match is achieved, the user is denied access.

Client applications or systems can also pass credentials to Couchbase Server by means of x.509 _certificates_.

[#introduction-to-password-based-authentication]
== Users, Usernames, and Passwords

To access Couchbase Server, all users and applications must authenticate.
This is typically achieved by means of a _username_ and _password_.

All information is provided in xref:learn:security/usernames-and-passwords.adoc[Usernames and Passwords].

[#authorization]
== Authorization

Couchbase-Server features &#8212; including data, settings, and statistics &#8212; can be accessed only by users who have been assigned the appropriate _privileges_.
Privileges include _read_, _read-write_, _execute_, and _manage_.
Privileges are assigned by _Full_ and _Security_ Administrators, in correspondence with _roles_.
When a user successfully authenticates, their assigned roles are examined, and access is granted or denied by Couchbase Server.

Roles can be assigned to a user in either or both of two ways:

* _Directly_.
The user is associated directly with one or more Couchbase-Server roles.

* _By Group_.
A Couchbase-Server _user-group_ is defined, and roles are assigned to the user-group.
The user is made a member of the user-group, and thereby inherits all the roles of the group.
A user can be a member of any number of groups.

Note that by means of _LDAP Group Support_, the roles assigned to a Couchbase-Server user-group can be inherited by users not defined on Couchbase Server; as described in xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc[Authentication Domains].

See
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups, and Roles], for details on creating users and groups, and assigning roles.

[#authentication-domains]
== Authentication Domains

Couchbase Server assigns each user to one of two _authentication domains_; which are _local_ and _external_.
The _local_ domain contains users defined locally, on Couchbase Server.
The _external_ domain contains users defined externally, either on an LDAP server, or on Linux systems that are accessed by means of _PAM_.
For a complete overview, see xref:learn:security/authentication-domains.adoc[Authentication Domains].
