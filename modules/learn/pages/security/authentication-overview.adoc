[abstract]
To access Couchbase Server, users must be authenticated.
_Authentication_ is a process for identifying who is attempting to access a system.
Subsequent to successful authentication, _authorization_ can be performed, whereby the user's appropriate access-level is determined.

[#passing-credentials]
== Authentication Overview

Couchbase-Server authentication relies on a _username_ and a _password_, which must be passed into the system by the _user_ (meaning, the administrator or application) that is attempting access.
The specified username and password must match ones already defined: these must be accessible either on the Couchbase-Server cluster itself, or _externally_.
External accessibility, which is available only with the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, means either:

* On a network-accessible directory-server, by means of the _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP).

* By means of the _Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) authentication-framework.

If a match is achieved, the user is thereby recognized, and so _may_ be granted access.
If no match is achieved, the user is denied access.

Client applications or systems can also pass credentials to Couchbase Server by means of x.509 _certificates_.

[#introduction-to-password-based-authentication]
== Users and Passwords

To access Couchbase Server, all users must authenticate.
For additional security, applications can be designed to use passwords in hash-based challenge-response routines.

The _Full Administrator_ username and password are established during initialization of Couchbase Server: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for details.

Subsequently, additional users can be added to the cluster as _local_ users, each with a unique password.
Passwords can be changed by means of the password-reset tool, xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-reset-admin-password.adoc[reset-admin-password]; or by Couchbase Web Console, as described in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc#editing-users-and-groups[Editing Users and Groups].
For best practices for password-definition, and restrictions on username-design, see xref:learn:security/usernames-and-passwords.adoc[Usernames and Passwords].

Users can also be added to the cluster as _external_ users, for whom no password need be specified; since the external user is to be authenticated externally.

[#console-access]
=== Authentication for Administrators

When an administrator logs into Couchbase Web Console, if the console is running on the default port, `+http://localhost:8091+`, the specified username and password are passed in the clear, from the browser to the console.

Optionally, Couchbase Web Console can be configured for _secure access_, at `+https://localhost:18091+`; so that the username and password are passed in encrypted form.
For information, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access].

[#authentication-for-applications]
=== Authentication for Applications

To pass credentials, applications must use one of four mechanisms provided by the _Simple Authentication and Security Layer_ (SASL) framework.
These are PLAIN, and three members of the _Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism_ family of hash functions; which are SCRAM-SHA1, SCRAM-SHA256, and SCRAM-SHA512.
The SCRAM mechanisms allow applications to authenticate securely, by transmitting the password only in _protected form_.
Drivers may need to be updated, to support SHA-based hash functions.

[#password-authentication-mechanisms]
In ascending order of strength, the Couchbase password-authentication mechanisms are as follows:

* _PLAIN_: The client sends the password in unencrypted form.
All clients support this authentication-method.
It is insecure, providing no defence against passwords being stolen in transmission.

* _SCRAM-SHA1_: Uses a 160-bit key.

* _SCRAM-SHA256_: One of a group of hash functions referred to as _SHA2_, SCRAM-SHA256 uses a 256-bit key.

* _SCRAM-SHA512_: Another hash function from the _SHA2_ group, SCRAM-SHA512 uses a 512-bit key; and is the strongest supported authentication protocol.

During initial client-server negotiation, the strongest authentication protocol supported by both Couchbase Server and the application's client OS is selected for use.
For example, if the client supports only the PLAIN protocol, the PLAIN protocol is used; but if the client also supports the SCRAM-SHA1 protocol, then SCRAM-SHA1 is used.

A challenge-response method can be transmitted through both encrypted and unencrypted channels.

Note that the SCRAM challenge-response protocols authenticate only the process of password-validation.
To secure the subsequent session, TLS should be used.

[#introduction-to-certificate-based-authentication]
=== Certificate-Based Authentication

Couchbase Server supports the use of x.509 certificates, to authenticate clients.
This ensures that only approved users, machines, or endpoints are authenticated.

Certificate-based authentication relies on a _Certificate Authority_ (CA) to validate identities and issue certificates.
The certificate includes information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, and the digital signature of the issuing CA.

For a complete overview of Couchbase Server's certificate-handling mechanisms, see xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].
For practical steps required to set up client and server certificates, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates]

[#authorization]
=== Authorization

Couchbase-Server features &#8212; including data, settings, and statistics &#8212; can be accessed only by users who have been assigned the appropriate _privileges_.
Privileges include _read_, _read-write_, _execute_, and _manage_.
Privileges are assigned by _Full_ and _Security_ Administrators, in correspondence with _roles_.
When a user successfully authenticates, their assigned roles are examined, and access is granted or denied by Couchbase Server.

Roles can be assigned to a user in either or both of two ways:

* _Directly_.
The user is associated directly with one or more Couchbase-Server roles.

* _By Group_.
A Couchbase-Server _user-group_ is defined, and roles are assigned to the user-group.
The user is made a member of the user-group, and thereby inherits all the roles of the group.
A user can be a member of any number of groups.

Note that by means of _LDAP Group Support_, the roles assigned to a Couchbase-Server user-group can be inherited by users not defined on Couchbase Server; as described in xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#introduction-to-externally-based-authentication[Authentication Domains], immediately below.

See
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups, and Roles], for details on creating users and groups, and assigning roles.

[#introduction-to-externally-based-authentication]
== Authentication Domains

Couchbase Server assigns each user to one of two _authentication domains_.
The domains are:

* _Local_: Contains users defined locally.
This includes:

 ** The _Full Administrator_ for Couchbase Server.

** _Locally Defined Users_, which are explicitly created by a Couchbase Server  administrator; and each feature a username and password unique within the Local domain.

 ** _Internal Components_ within Couchbase Server that support core  functionality (for example, indexing, searching, and replicating), and run  with full administrative privileges.

 ** _Generated Users_, which are created by Couchbase Server as part of the  upgrade process from pre-5.0 to 5.0 and post-5.0 versions; each in  correspondence with a legacy bucket.
Each Generated User is assigned a _username_ that is identical to the bucket-name; and either a _password_ that is identical to the bucket's pre-5.0 password, or _no password_, if the bucket did not feature a password.
Generated Users are created to ensure that legacy applications can continue to access legacy buckets after upgrade to 5.0 or post-5.0, with the same username-password combination being used for authentication.

* _External_: Contains either or both of the following:

** Users that are explicitly registered on Couchbase Server as _external_; as supported either by _LDAP_ or _PAM_.
Usernames and passwords are defined and stored remotely; with the usernames also stored on Couchbase Server.
Note that external usernames do not clash with local usernames.

** Users that are not defined or registered on Couchbase Server in any way, and are defined entirely on LDAP.
In this case, _Native LDAP Support_ must have been used to configure Couchbase Server's access to LDAP, with _LDAP Group Support_ enabled.
If one or more of the user's LDAP Groups has been _mapped_ to a corresponding Couchbase-Server user-group, the user can be authenticated on the LDAP server, and then be granted the roles assigned to each of the user-groups to which a mapping has been made.

When a user attempts to authenticate, Couchbase Server always looks up their credentials in the same order: which is _Local_ first, and _External_ second.

[#introduction-to-ldap-based-authentication]
=== LDAP-Based Authentication

LDAP-based authentication must be set up in one of the following ways;

* _Native LDAP Support_.
For Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5+, this is the recommended way of setting up LDAP for external authentication.
It provides support for encrypted communication, and for LDAP groups.

* _LDAP Support Based on saslauthd_.
`saslauthd` is maintained for support of legacy LDAP authentication, as established on pre-6.5 versions of Couchbase Server.
(Note that `saslauthd` also provides support of legacy PAM-based authentication.)
Migration to _Native LDAP_ is recommended, so that _LDAP Group Support_ becomes available.

Note that _either_ Native LDAP Support _or_ `saslauthd` must be selected for the cluster.
The two cannot be used simultaneously.

[#native-ldap-support]
== Native LDAP Support

Native LDAP Support is available only for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server.
Mixed-version clusters do not support LDAP authentication: therefore, to use LDAP authentication with a given cluster, upgrade all cluster-nodes to the latest version of Enterprise Edition Couchbase Server.

Couchbase Server is designed to interoperate with _OpenLDAP_ software, which can be downloaded from the http://www.openldap.org/[openldap.org^] website.
Couchbase Server also supports _Active Directory_.

[#ldap-benefits]
=== Native LDAP Benefits

Authenticating with Native LDAP provides the benefits of:

* Centralized identity and security-policy management, on the LDAP server.

* LDAP groups, which are recognized by Couchbase Server.
These provide simplified user-administration, allowing Couchbase Server-privileges to be assigned by group,
rather than just by user.
See xref:learn:security/authentication-overview.adoc#introduction-to-ldap-groups[LDAP Groups], below.

* Cross-platform support.
Native LDAP authentication can be used for clusters running on any Couchbase-Server supported operating system. (This contrasts with `saslauthd`, which runs only on Linux.)

Couchbase Server allows Native LDAP to be configured by means of the xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#configure-ldap-with-the-ui[UI]; or by means of the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap] CLI command.

[#introduction-to-ldap-groups]
=== LDAP Groups

LDAP allows users to be members of _LDAP Groups_.
When a user authenticates with LDAP, a list of the user's LDAP groups is returned to Couchbase Server.
If an LDAP group has previously been _mapped_ to a Couchbase-Server group, the user inherits the roles assigned to the Couchbase-Server group.
Note that LDAP Groups thus allow users _not_ registered on Couchbase Server &#8212; even as _external_ &#8212; to be authorized.

[#native-ldap-auth-sequence]
=== Native LDAP Authentication and Authorization Sequence

In cases where the specified username does not match against the list of locally defined users, if _Native LDAP Support_ has been configured, Couchbase Server attempts to authenticate and authorize the user by means of LDAP.
First, the _authentication_ sequence is performed:

. If _LDAP User Authentication_ has been enabled, Couchbase Server calculates an LDAP _Distinguished Name_ (DN) for the user, whereby the user can be authenticated on the LDAP server.
This makes use of the user-specified password and a _template_ or _query_, which has been preconfigured: for examples of how to configure templates and queries, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#enable-ldap-user-authentication[User Authentication Enablement].

. Couchbase Server contacts the LDAP server, and attempts to authenticate the user, using the DN that has been calculated, and the user-specified password.

. Couchbase Server receives confirmation from the LDAP server either that authentication has succeeded (meaning that the user exists, and has submitted the correct password), or that it has failed.
If authentication has failed, the authentication-process is thereby concluded, the user is _not_ granted access to Couchbase Server, and no further action is taken.

If authentication has succeeded, the authentication-process is thereby concluded; and Couchbase Server next proceeds to determine whether and in what ways the user is _authorized_ on Couchbase Server.

. Couchbase Server checks whether an _external_ user, with the specified username, has previously been added to Couchbase Server.
If such an external user is located, Couchbase Server determines which roles have been assigned to the user: first, it checks for roles that have been _directly_ assigned to the user; and secondly, it checks for roles assigned to the user by means of _group membership_.
(For information on granting roles to users directly and by means of groups, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups, and Roles].) The user is granted the privileges that correspond to each of their assigned roles.

. If _LDAP Group Support_ has been enabled, Couchbase Server again contacts the LDAP server: this time, in order to retrieve a list of the LDAP groups of which the user is a member.
Note that this step is performed irrespective of whether the user has been determined to be an _external_ user on Couchbase Server.
See xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap#group-authorization-enablement[Group Authorization Enablement], for detailed information on configuring LDAP Group Support.

. Couchbase Server determines whether one or more of the user's LDAP groups have been _mapped_ to existing Couchbase-Server user-groups.
Wherever a mapping exists, the user is granted (in addition to whatever privileges they may have already been granted as an _external_ user) the privileges that correspond to all roles assigned to the Couchbase-Server user-group.
(For information on mapping LDAP groups to Couchbase-Server user-groups, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc#map-ldap-groups-to-couchbase-server-roles[Map LDAP Groups to Couchbase-Server Roles].)
+
If any granted privilege supports the user's intended action, the action is permitted; otherwise, the action is prohibited.

For detailed, step-by-step accounts of how to configure these procedures, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-ldap.adoc[Configure LDAP].

[#saslauthd-and-pam]
== saslauthd, LDAP, and PAM

`saslauthd` is maintained for support of legacy LDAP and PAM-based authentication, as established on pre-6.5 versions of Couchbase Server.
Migration to _Native LDAP_ is recommended, so that _LDAP Group Support_ becomes available.

[#using-saslauthd]
=== saslauthd and LDAP

LDAP authentication based on `saslauthd` is only available for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, and only on the Linux platform.
It provides the benefits of centralized identity and security-policy management, and of simplified compliance.
It does not support LDAP groups.

For LDAP authentication, _Native LDAP_ , rather than `saslauthd`, is recommended for Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5+.

For details on configuring `saslauthd` to support external authentication by LDAP, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure `saslauthd`].

[#introduction-to-pam-based-authentication]
=== saslauthd and PAM

_Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) provide an authentication framework that allows multiple, low-level authentication schemes to be used by a single API.
The _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, running on Linux, supports administrator-authentication through PAM's _Linux password-module_.

[#pam-benefits]
Used with the _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, the PAM _Linux password-module_ provides:

* _External authentication_: Administrator-accounts defined on Linux systems, in the `/etc/shadow` directory, can be accessed for authentication-purposes by Couchbase Server.

* _Password policy-management_: Linux password-management can be used across different Couchbase Server-nodes; to synchronize, maintain, and expire administrator-passwords.

Note that use of the PAM Linux password-module requires all cluster-nodes to be Linux-based, running the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, version 4.6 or above.
Additionally, the `saslauthd` library version must be 2.1.x or above.

For details on configuring `saslauthd` to support external authentication by PAM, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure `saslauthd`].
