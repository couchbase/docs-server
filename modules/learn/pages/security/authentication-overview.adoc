= Authentication
:page-aliases: security:security-authentication,security:security-ldap-new

[abstract]
To access Couchbase Server, administrators and applications must be authenticated.
_Authentication_ is a process for identifying a user who is attempting to access a system.

[#passing-credentials]
== Passing Credentials

Couchbase-Server authentication relies on _credentials_, which must be passed into the system by the user who is attempting access.
Credentials can be entered manually, or passed into the system by an application.
The credentials passed must match ones already stored and accessible by the system: if a match is achieved, the user is thereby recognized, and so _may_ be granted access.
If no match is achieved, the user is denied access.

To access Couchbase Server, administrators authenticate by means of a username and password.
These credentials can be validated by Couchbase Server itself: alternatively if the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server for Linux is used, validation can be performed either  on a network-accessible directory-server, by means of the _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP); or by means of the _Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) authentication-framework.

Client applications or systems can also pass credentials to Couchbase Server, by means of x.509 _certificates_.

[#introduction-to-password-based-authentication]
== Password-Based Authentication

To access Couchbase Server, administrators and applications _must_ authenticate.
Authentication is password-based.
For additional security, applications can be designed to use passwords in hash-based challenge-response routines.

Administrator usernames and passwords, both required for authentication, are initially established during initialization of Couchbase Server: see xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster] for details.
Subsequently, passwords can be changed by means of the password-reset tool, xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-reset-admin-password.adoc[reset-admin-password].

For best practices for password-definition, and restrictions on username-design, see xref:learn:security/usernames-and-passwords.adoc[Usernames and Passwords].

When the Couchbase Web Console is running on the default port, `+http://localhost:8091+`, the administrator's username and password are
passed in the clear, from the administrator's browser to the console.
Optionally, Couchbase Web Console can be configured for _secure access_, at `+https://localhost:18091+`; so that the username and password are passed in encrypted form.
For information, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-console-access.adoc[Manage Console Access].

[#authentication-for-applications]
=== Authentication for Applications

Couchbase Server-features — including data, settings, and statistics — can be accessed only by users who have been assigned the appropriate privilege.
Each privilage is either _read_ or _read-write_.
Privileges are assigned by Full Administrators, in the form of _roles_.
When a user successfully authenticates, their assigned roles are examined, and access is granted or denied by Couchbase Server.
See
xref:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles], for details on creating users and user-credentials, and on assigning roles.

To pass credentials, applications must use one of four mechanisms provided by the _Simple Authentication and Security Layer_ (SASL) framework.
These are PLAIN, and three members of the _Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism_ family of hash functions; which are SCRAM-SHA1, SCRAM-SHA256, and SCRAM-SHA512.
The SCRAM mechanisms allow applications to authenticate securely, by transmitting the password only in _protected form_.
Drivers may need to be updated, to support SHA-based hash functions.

[#password-authentication-mechanisms]
=== Password Authentication-Mechanisms

In ascending order of strength, the Couchbase password-authentication mechanisms are as follows:

* _PLAIN_: The client sends the password in unencrypted form.
All clients support this authentication-method.
It is insecure, providing no defence against passwords being stolen in transmission.

* _SCRAM-SHA1_: Uses a 160-bit key.

* _SCRAM-SHA256_: One of a group of hash functions referred to as _SHA2_, SCRAM-SHA256 uses a 256-bit key.

* _SCRAM-SHA512_: Another hash function from the _SHA2_ group, SCRAM-SHA512 uses a 512-bit key; and is the strongest supported authentication protocol.

During initial client-server negotiation, the strongest authentication protocol supported by both Couchbase Server and the application's client OS is selected for use.
For example, if the client supports only the PLAIN protocol, the PLAIN protocol is used; but if the client also supports the SCRAM-SHA1 protocol, then SCRAM-SHA1 is used.

A challenge-response method can be transmitted through both encrypted and unencrypted channels.

Note that the SCRAM challenge-response protocols authenticate only the process of password-validation.
To secure the subsequent session, TLS should be used.

[#introduction-to-certificate-based-authentication]
== Certificate-Based Authentication

Couchbase Server supports the use of x.509 certificates, to authenticate clients. This ensures that only approved users, machines, or endpoints are authenticated.
This authentication mechanism can be used by the Couchbase SDK to access the Data, Query, and Search Services.

Certificate-based authentication relies on a _Certificate Authority_ (CA) to validate identities and issue certificates.
The certificate includes information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, and the digital signature of the issuing CA.

For a complete overview of Couchbase Server's certificate-handling mechanisms, see xref:learn:security/certificates.adoc[Certificates].
For practical steps required to set up client and server certificates, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage Certificates]

[#introduction-to-externally-based-authentication]
== Externally Based Authentication

Couchbase Server assigns users to different _authentication domains_:

* _Local_: Contains users defined locally.
This includes:

 ** The _Full Administrator_ for Couchbase Server.

 ** _Internal Components_ within Couchbase Server that support core  functionality (for example, indexing, searching, and replicating), and run  with full administrative privileges.

 ** _Generated Users_, which are created by Couchbase Server as part of the  upgrade process from pre-5.0 to 5.0 and post-5.0 versions; each in  correspondence with a legacy bucket.
Each Generated User is assigned a _username_ that is identical to the bucket-name; and either a _password_ that is identical to the bucket's pre-5.0 password, or _no password_, if the bucket did not feature a password.
Generated Users are created to ensure that legacy applications can continue to access legacy buckets after upgrade to 5.0 or post-5.0, with the same username-password combination being used for authentication.

 ** _Locally Defined Users_, which are explicitly created by a Couchbase Server  administrator; and each feature a username and password unique within the Local domain.

* _External_: Contains users defined externally; either by means of _LDAP_ or _PAM_.
Passwords are defined and stored remotely.
Note that External usernames do not clash with Local usernames.

When a user attempts to authenticate, Couchbase Server always looks up their credentials in the same order: which is _Local_ first, and _External_ second.

_External_ authentication can be performed by means either of _LDAP_ or _PAM_.

[#introduction-to-ldap-based-authentication]
=== LDAP-Based Authentication

Couchbase administrators can be set up to authenticate by means of LDAP.
This requires that each administrator be added as a user on an LDAP server, and their LDAP credentials mapped to Couchbase Server.
Additionally, it requires that the `saslauthd` library, which handles authentication-requests on behalf of Couchbase Server, be configured to handle LDAP authentication.

LDAP authentication is currently available only for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, and only on the Linux platform.
Note also that mixed-version clusters do not support LDAP authentication: therefore, to use LDAP authentication with a given cluster, upgrade all cluster-nodes to the latest version of Enterprise Edition Couchbase Server.

Couchbase Server is designed to interoperate with _OpenLDAP_ software, which can be downloaded from the http://www.openldap.org/[openldap.org^] website.

[#ldap-benefits]
==== LDAP Benefits

Authenticating with LDAP provides the benefits of:

* _Centralized identity management_.
Multiple administrators can be defined, each with either _read-only_ or full, _read-write_ permissions.

* _Centralized security policy-management_.
All administrative accounts can be consistently protected: for example, through the enforcement of password strength-levels, password-rotation, and auto-lockout.

* _Simplified compliance_.
The activities of each administrator can be identified, tracked, and comprehensively audited.

[#ldap-architecture]
==== Architecture

The LDAP authentication-architecture used by Couchbase Server is as follows:

image::security/security-ldap.png[,650,align=left]

As the illustration shows, the administrator enters a username and password at the login prompt provided by Couchbase Web Console.
This is checked against a local _admin password file_.
If the `saslauthd` library has been configured for LDAP, the credentials are then checked against an LDAP directory service: if the credentials are validated, authentication succeeds.

For details on configuring the `saslauthd` library, see xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure `saslauthd`].

[#introduction-to-pam-based-authentication]
== PAM-Based Authentication

_Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) provide an authentication framework that allows multiple, low-level authentication schemes to be used by a single API.
The _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, running on Linux, supports administrator-authentication through PAM's _Linux password-module_.

[#pam-benefits]
=== PAM Benefits

Used with the _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, the PAM _Linux password-module_ provides:

* _External authentication_: Administrator-accounts defined on Linux systems, in the `/etc/shadow` directory, can be accessed for authentication-purposes by Couchbase Server.

* _Password policy-management_: Linux password-management can be used across different Couchbase Server-nodes; to synchronize, maintain, and expire administrator-passwords.

=== PAM-Related Version Requirements

Use of the PAM Linux password-module requires all cluster-nodes to be Linux-based, running the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, version 4.6 or above.
Additionally, the `saslauthd` library version must be 2.1.x or above.
