{description}
Subsequent to successful authentication, _authorization_ can be performed, whereby the user's appropriate access-level is determined.

Authentication can be performed by means of a _username_ and _password_, assigned to each administrator or application.
Authentication can also be performed by means of _X.509 Certificates_: these support _Transport Layer Security_, by establishing the identity of a client or server through _digital signatures_.
They also provide keys to support _on-the-wire_ encryption, according to the conventions of _Public Key Infrastructure_ (PKI).

Couchbase Server assigns each user to one of two _authentication domains_: the _local_ domain consisting of users whose credentials are maintained by Couchbase Server itself; the _external_ domain consisting of users whose credentials are maintained remotely &#8212; for example, on an _LDAP_ server.
