== Introduction to Externally Based Authentcation

Authentication with Couchbase Server can be performed externally, by means
either of:

* LDAP
* PAM

== LDAP-Based Authentication

[abstract]
Couchbase administrators can be set up to authenticate by means of LDAP.
This requires that each administrator be added as a user on an LDAP server, and their LDAP credentials mapped to Couchbase Server.
Additionally, it requires that the `saslauthd` library, which handles authentication-requests on behalf of Couchbase Server, be configured to handle LDAP authentication.

== Restrictions

LDAP authentication is currently available only for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, and only on the Linux platform.

Note also that mixed-version clusters do not support LDAP authentication: therefore, to use LDAP authentication with a given cluster, upgrade all cluster-nodes to the latest version of Enterprise Edition Couchbase Server.

Couchbase Server is designed to interoperate with _OpenLDAP_ software, which can be downloaded from the http://www.openldap.org/[openldap.org^] website.

== Benefits

Authenticating Couchbase Server-administrators with LDAP provides the benefits of:

* _Centralized identity management_.
Multiple administrators can be defined, each with either _read-only_ or full, _read-write_ permissions.

* _Centralized security policy-management_.
All administrative accounts can be consistently protected: for example, through the enforcement of password strength-levels, password-rotation, and auto-lockout.

* _Simplified compliance_.
The activities of each administrator can be identified, tracked, and comprehensively audited.

== Architecture

The LDAP authentication-architecture used by Couchbase Server is as follows:

As the illustration shows, the administrator enters a username and password at the login prompt provided by Couchbase Web Console.
This is checked against a local _admin password file_.
If the `saslauthd` library has been configured for LDAP, the credentials are then checked against an LDAP directory service: if the credentials are validated, authentication succeeds.

For details on configuring the `saslauthd` library, see
xref:manage:manage-security/configure-saslauthd.adoc[Configure saslauthd].


== PAM-Based Authentication

_Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) provide an authentication framework that allows multiple, low-level authentication schemes to be used by a single API.
The _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, running on Linux, supports administrator-authentication through PAM's _Linux password-module_.

== PAM Features

Used with the _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, the PAM _Linux password-module_ provides:

* _External authentication_: Administrator-accounts defined on Linux systems, in the `/etc/shadow` directory, can be accessed for authentication-purposes by Couchbase Server.

* _Password policy-management_: Linux password-management can be used across different Couchbase Server-nodes; to synchronize, maintain, and expire administrator-passwords.

== Version Requirements

Use of the PAM Linux password-module requires all cluster-nodes to be Linux-based, running the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, version 4.6 or above.
Additionally, the `saslauthd` library version must be 2.1.x or above.
