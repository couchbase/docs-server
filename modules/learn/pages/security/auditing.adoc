Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending corresponding output to target files.

== Introduction to Auditing

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific _events_, which can be configured to produce logged output: the output is written to a specific target file, which is periodically rotated.

=== List of Audit Events

Events audited by Couchbase Server include successful and failed logins, events associated with cluster and bucket configuration, and the use of tools that require administrative privileges.
Corresponding information is captured in _output targets_, which are files in JSON format.

Couchbase Server generates audit events whenever the following actions occur:

=== Audit Fields

The table below contains some frequently used audit fields with corresponding descriptions.
Note that different event-types generate different field-subsets.

.Audit record content
[cols="1,2,4"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `type`
| string
| The audit-type.
For example, Login, Startup, Shutdown, Password, AuditStart, AuditStop, AuditTruncate.

| `timestamp`
| document
| Contains the date and UTC time of the event in ISO 8601 format.
For example, http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[^].

| `id`
| integer
| A unique identifier for the event-type.

| `local`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the local IP-address and the port-number of the running instance.

| `remote`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the remote IP-address, the port-number, and additional information on the service used on the incoming connection associated with the event.

Possible services include `cbmcd`, `cbhttp`, `cbmgmt`, `cbxdcr`, `cbn1ql`, and `cbsyncgw`.

| `user`
| string
| A string that identifies the user.

| `params`
| document
| Information dependent on the event-type.
For example, for a bucket-operation, the bucket name is captured.

| `result`
| integer or string
| An error-code or other message, related to the attempted operation.
|===



=== Audit Log Targets

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Auditing].

==== Login

An audit-record for a successful login might appear as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp":"2015-02-20T08:48:49.408-08:00",
  "id":8192,
  "name":"login success",
  "description":"Successful login to couchbase cluster",
  "role":"admin",

 "remote":{
  "ip":"172.23.107.165", "port":59383
  }
}
----

In this example, a user named `bjones` has successfully logged into a Couchbase cluster using the domain IP address `172.23.107.165.`

==== Login Failure
