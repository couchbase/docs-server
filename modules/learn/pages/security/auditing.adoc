[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending corresponding output to target files.

[#introduction-to-auditing]
== Introduction to Auditing

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific _events_, which can be selectively logged.
The output is written to target files, each of which is periodically rotated.

Couchbase events allow administrators to track the following:

* Administrative and configuration changes to the cluster.
These are logged as _admin_ events.
See xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#administrative-events[Administrative Events], below.

* Attempts to access and change data.
These are logged as _data_ events.
See xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#data-events[Data Events], below.

This page also explains frequently used audit fields, and gives examples of the record-structures used within target files.

Note that event-auditing occurs on a _per node_ basis: each node captures its own events only.
If a cluster-wide record is needed, the individual per node records must be manually consolidated by the administrator.

For information on managing auditing, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

== Audit Fields

The table below contains some frequently used audit fields with corresponding descriptions.
Note that different event-types generate different field-subsets.

[cols="2,3,5"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `type`
| string
| The audit-type.
For example, Login, Startup, Shutdown, Password, AuditStart, AuditStop, AuditTruncate.

| `timestamp`
| document
| Contains the date and UTC time of the event in ISO 8601 format.
For example, http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[^].

| `id`
| integer
| A unique identifier for the event-type.

| `local`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the local IP-address and the port-number of the running instance.

| `remote`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the remote IP-address, the port-number, and additional information on the service used on the incoming connection associated with the event.

Possible services include `cbmcd`, `cbhttp`, `cbmgmt`, `cbxdcr`, `cbn1ql`, and `cbsyncgw`.

| `user`
| string
| A string that identifies the user.

| `params`
| document
| Information dependent on the event-type.
For example, for a bucket-operation, the bucket name is captured.

| `result`
| integer or string
| An error-code or other message, related to the attempted operation.
|===

== Audit Target-Files

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

=== Login

An audit-record for a successful login might appear as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp":"2015-02-20T08:48:49.408-08:00",
  "id":8192,

 "remote":{
  "ip":"172.23.107.165", "port":59383

[#administrative-events]
== Event-List Tables

The events listed in the following tables support the auditing of administrative and configuration changes made to the cluster.
Each table corresponds to one of the event-groups whereby events are listed in Couchbase Web Console; in the *Events* panel, accessed under the *Auditing* tab of the Couchbase Web Console *Security* screen.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing], for details.

In each table, the first column (at the left) features the event-name; the second the event-description; the third the event-group heading (thereby repeating the table's title, so as to ensure readability throughout the longer tables); and the fourth, the event _type_ &#8212; whether the event describes a change to _data_ or _administrative status_.

The tables &#8212; which are for the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#rest-api-event-list-table[REST API], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#data-service-event-list-table[Data Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#query-service-event-list-table[Query Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#eventing-service-event-list-table[Eventing Service], he xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#analytics-service-event-list-table[Analytics Service], xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#views-event-list-table[Views], and xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#audit-event-list-table[Audit] &#8212; are below.

[#event-types]
=== Event Types

Couchbase Server events are _typed_ as either _Data_ or _Admin_.

* A _Data_ event signifies that:

** A document is created, updated, read, deleted, locked, or unlocked.
** A N1QL query of any kind is executed, including index-creation.
** A View Query Request is made, or Design Doc is created, updated, or deleted.

* An _Admin_ event signifies any other kind of change on the cluster.
This includes changes to buckets, nodes, disks, server groups, DCP, XDCR, Authentication (including certificate management), Authorization, failover, rebalance and reprovisioning, configuration, auditing, eventing, and analytics.
