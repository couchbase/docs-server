[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending output to a log-file.

[#introduction-to-auditing]
== Introduction to Auditing

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific _events_, which can be selectively logged.
The output is written to a log-file, which is periodically rotated.

[#adit_event_types]
== Audit Event-Types

Couchbase events are of two kinds, respectively allowing administrators to track:

* Administrative and configuration changes to the cluster.
These are considered _admin_ events.

* Attempts to access and change data.
These are considered _data_ events.

Note that event-auditing occurs on a _per node_ basis: each node captures its own events only.
If a cluster-wide record is needed, the individual per node records must be manually consolidated by the administrator.

This page explains frequently used audit fields, and gives examples of the record-structures used within target files.
For information on managing auditing, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

== Audit Fields

The table below lists frequently used audit fields, with corresponding descriptions.
Note that different event-types generate different field-subsets.

[cols="2,2,5"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `"id"`
| Integer
| The unique identifier for the event.
For example, `20480`, `8192`, `28672`.

| `"name"`
| String
| The name of the event.
For example, `"login success"`, `"User was deleted"`, `"A N1QL UPSERT statement was executed"`.

| `"description"`
| String
| A description for the event.
For example, `"Unsuccessful attempt to login to couchbase cluster"`, `"Node was removed from the cluster"`, `"Bucket was created"`.

| `"filtering_permitted"`
| Boolean
| Whether the event is filterable.
Can be `true` or `false`.

| `"mandatory_fields"`
| Object
| Contains key-value pairs that are mandatory for all events.
These include the `"timestamp"` for the event (for example, `"2020-01-29T08:02:07.476-08:00"`: see http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[^]), and the `"user"`.
|===

== Audit Target-Files

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

=== Login

[#filterable-and-non-filterable-events]
== Filterable and Non-Filterable Events

Eventing for each cluster-node is _disabled_ by default; and can be explicitly _enabled_.
When enablement has occurred, a default subset of Couchbase Server-events is audited, with records duly concatenated to the end of the `audit.log` file.
The events in this default subset are _non-filterable_.
This means that while auditing is enabled for the node, the events are _always_ recorded, and cannot be selectively disabled.

An additional event-subset, of _filterable_ events, is provided.
These events relate to the same modules as the non-filterable events: however, filterable events can be individually disabled or enabled; and, optionally, all filterable events can be ignored, for specified users.

For information on how to filter events, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

== Event Tables

The events listed in the following tables support the auditing of administrative and data changes, made on the cluster.

In each table, the first column (at the left) features the event-group heading (thereby repeating the table’s title, so as to ensure readability throughout the longer tables).
The second column provides the event name.
The third column provides the id for the event.
The fourth column provides a description of the event; the fifth describes whether it is _filterable_; and the sixth indicates whether the event is classified as Data or Admin.

The tables — which are for the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#rest-api-event-list-table[REST API], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#data-service-event-list-table[Data Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#query-service-event-list-table[Query Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#search-service-event-list-table[Search Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#eventing-service-event-list-table[Eventing Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#analytics-service-event-list-table[Analytics Service], and the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#audit-event-list-table[Audit] facility itself — are as follows.
