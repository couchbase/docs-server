[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending corresponding output to target files.

[#introduction-to-auditing]
== Introduction to Auditing

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific _events_, which can be selectively logged.
The output is written to target files, each of which is periodically rotated.

Couchbase events allow administrators to track the following:

* Administrative and configuration changes to the cluster.
These are logged as _Admin_ events.
An Admin event does not expose any data.

* Attempts to access and change data.
These are logged as _Data_ events.

This page also explains frequently used audit fields, and gives examples of the record-structures used within target files.

Note that event-auditing occurs on a _per node_ basis: each node captures its own events only.
If a cluster-wide record is needed, the individual per node records must be manually consolidated by the administrator.

For information on managing auditing, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

[#filterable-and-non-filterable-events]
== Filterable and Non-Filterable Events

Eventing for each cluster-node is _disabled_ by default; and can be explicitly _enabled_.
When enablement has occurred, a subset of Couchbase Server-events starts to be audited, with records concatenated to the end of the `audit.log` file.
Events correspond to and are generated by the following Couchbase-Server _modules_: the REST API, the Data Service, the Query and Index Services, the Eventing Service, the Analytics Service, Views, and the Audit facility.

The events in the default subset are _non-filterable_.
This means that when auditing has been enabled for the node, they are _always_ recorded in `audit.log`, and cannot be selectively disabled, either for one or more modules, or for one or more users.

An additional subset of _filterable_ events is provided.
These correspond to and are generated by the same modules as the non-filterable events.
Each filterable event has an _id_ by which it can be referenced, and can be individually disabled and enabled.
Optionally, all filterable events can be ignored, for specified users.

See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing] for details on performing auditing configuration.

== Audit Fields

The table below contains some frequently used audit fields with corresponding descriptions.
Note that different event-types generate different field-subsets.

[cols="2,3,5"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `type`
| string
| The audit-type.
For example, Login, Startup, Shutdown, Password, AuditStart, AuditStop, AuditTruncate.

| `timestamp`
| document
| Contains the date and UTC time of the event in ISO 8601 format.
For example, http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[^].

| `id`
| integer
| A unique identifier for the event-type.

| `local`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the local IP-address and the port-number of the running instance.

| `remote`
a|
document

[source,json]
----
{ip: <String>,
port: <int>},
----
| A JSON document that contains the remote IP-address, the port-number, and additional information on the service used on the incoming connection associated with the event.

Possible services include `cbmcd`, `cbhttp`, `cbmgmt`, `cbxdcr`, `cbn1ql`, and `cbsyncgw`.

| `user`
| string
| A string that identifies the user.

| `params`
| document
| Information dependent on the event-type.
For example, for a bucket-operation, the bucket name is captured.

| `result`
| integer or string
| An error-code or other message, related to the attempted operation.
|===

== The audit.log File

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a file named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

=== Login

An audit-record for a successful login might appear as follows:

[source,json]

[#administrative-events]
== Event Tables

The events listed in the following tables support the auditing of administrative and configuration changes made to the cluster.
Each table corresponds to one of the event-groups whereby events are listed in Couchbase Web Console; in the *Events* panel, accessed under the *Auditing* tab of the Couchbase Web Console *Security* screen.
See xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing], for details.

In each table, the first column (at the left) features the event-name; the second the event-description; the third the event-group heading (thereby repeating the table's title, so as to ensure readability throughout the longer tables); and the fourth, the event _type_ &#8212; whether the event is classified as _Data_ or _Admin_.

The tables &#8212; which are for the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#rest-api-event-list-table[REST API], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#data-service-event-list-table[Data Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#query-service-event-list-table[Query Service], the xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#eventing-service-event-list-table[Eventing Service], he xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#analytics-service-event-list-table[Analytics Service], xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#views-event-list-table[Views], and xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc#audit-event-list-table[Audit] &#8212; are below.
