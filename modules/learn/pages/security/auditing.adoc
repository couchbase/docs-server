[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending output to a log-file.

[#introduction-to-auditing]
== Introduction to Auditing

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific, server-generated _events_, which can be logged.
The output is written to a log-file, which is periodically rotated.

[#adit_event_types]
== Audit Event-Types

Events generated by Couchbase Server are of two kinds:

* _Admin_ events, which track administrative and configuration changes to the cluster.

* _Data_ events, which track attempts to access and change data.

Note that event-auditing occurs on a _per node_ basis: each node captures its own events only.
If a cluster-wide record is needed, the individual per node records must be manually consolidated by the administrator.

This page explains frequently used audit fields, and gives examples of record-structures.
For information on managing auditing, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].
See the reference page xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc[Audit Event Reference], for a complete list of events that can be audited.

== Audit Fields

The table below lists frequently used audit fields, with corresponding descriptions.
Note that different event-types generate different field-subsets.

[cols="7,4,10"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description

| `"id"`
| Integer
| The unique identifier for the event.
For example, `20480`, `8192`, `28672`.

| `"name"`
| String
| The name of the event.
For example, `"login success"`, `"User was deleted"`, `"A N1QL UPSERT statement was executed"`.

| `"description"`
| String
| A description for the event.
For example, `"Unsuccessful attempt to login to couchbase cluster"`, `"Node was removed from the cluster"`, `"Bucket was created"`.

| `"filtering_permitted"`
| Boolean
| Whether the event is filterable.
Can be `true` or `false`.

| `"mandatory_fields"`
| Object
| Contains key-value pairs that are mandatory for all events.
These include the `"timestamp"` for the event (for example, `"2020-01-29T08:02:07.476-08:00"`: see http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime[^]), and the `"user"`.

[#saving-audit-records]
== Saving Audit Records

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

[#filterable-and-non-filterable-events]
== Filterable and Non-Filterable Events

Eventing for each cluster-node is _disabled_ by default; and can be explicitly _enabled_.
When enablement has occurred, a default subset of Couchbase Server-events is audited, with records duly concatenated to the end of the `audit.log` file.
The events in this default subset are _non-filterable_; meaning that while auditing is enabled for the node, _all_ the events in the subset are _always_ recorded, and cannot be selectively disabled.

An additional event-subset, of _filterable_ events, is provided.
These events relate to the same modules as the non-filterable events: however, filterable events can be individually disabled or enabled; and, optionally, all filterable events can be ignored, for specified users.

For information on how to filter events, see xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

== Event Tables

See the reference page xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc[Audit Event Reference], for a complete list of events that can be audited.
