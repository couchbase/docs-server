[#memory-optimized-index-storage]
== Memory-Optimized Index Storage

[.labels]
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

Memory-optimized index-storage is supported by the _Nitro_ storage engine, and is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

Memory-optimized index-storage allows high-speed maintenance and scanning; since the index is kept fully in memory at all times.
A snapshot of the index is maintained on disk, to permit rapid recovery if node-failures are experienced.
To be consistently beneficial, memory-optimized index-storage requires that all nodes running the Index Service have a memory quota sufficient for the number and size of their resident indexes, and for the frequency with which the indexes will be updated and scanned.

Memory-optimized index-storage may be less suitable for nodes where memory is constrained; since whenever the Index Service memory-quota is exceeded, indexes on the node can neither be updated nor scanned.

If indexer RAM usage goes above 75% of the Index Service memory-quota, an xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-alerts.adoc[error-notification] is provided.
If indexer RAM usage then goes above 95% of the Index Service memory-quota, the indexer goes into the Paused mode on that node; and although the indexes remain in `Active` state, traffic is routed away from the node.

Before index-operations can resume, memory must be freed.
When the indexer RAM usage drops below 80% of the Index Service memory-quota, the indexer goes into Active mode again on that node.

To resume indexing operations on a node where the Indexer has paused due to low memory, consider taking one or more of the following actions:

* Increase the index-memory quota, to give indexes additional memory for request-processing.
* Remove less important indexes from the node, to free up memory.
* Remove buckets with indexes: removing a bucket automatically removes all the dependent indexes.
* Flush buckets that have indexes: flushing a bucket deletes all data in a bucket; and even if there are pending updates not yet processed, flushing causes all indexes to drop their own data.
+
Note that attempting to delete bucket-data _selectively_ during an out-of-memory condition does not succeed in decreasing memory-usage; since without memory, such requested deletions cannot themselves be processed.

In cases where recovery requires an Index-Service node to be restarted, the node's resident memory-optimized indexes are rebuilt from the snapshots retained on disk.
Following the node's restart, these indexes remain in the `Warmup` state until all information has been read into memory: then, final updates are made with the indexes in `Active` state.
Note that once a rebuilt index is thus available, queries with `consistency=request_plus` or `consistency=at_plus` fail, if the specified timestamp exceeds the last timestamp processed by given index. footnote:[In fact, queries in this case wait for a consistent snapshot to be available and time out, rather than fail immediately.]
However, queries with `consistency=unbounded` execute normally.
For information on these settings, see xref:services-and-indexes/indexes/index-replication.adoc[Index Availability and Performance].

[#standard-index-storage]
== Standard Index Storage

_Standard_ is the default storage-setting for Secondary Indexes: the indexes are saved on disk; in a disk-optimized format that uses both memory and disk for index-update and scanning.
The performance of standard index storage depends on overall I/O performance.

****
[.edition]#{enterprise}#

In Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition, standard index-storage is supported by the _Plasma_ storage engine.
In this case, compaction is handled automatically.
****

****
[.edition]#{community}#

In Couchbase Server Community Edition, standard index-storage is supported by the _ForestDB_ storage engine.
In this case, each index saved with the _standard_ option has two write modes:

[[circular-reuse]]Circular Write Mode:: Writes changes to the end of the index-file, until the relative index fragmentation exceeds 65%.
_Block reuse_ is then triggered: new data is written into stale blocks where possible, rather than to the end of the file, so as to optimize I/O throughput.
Full compaction runs in accordance with the value of the *Circular write mode with day + time interval trigger* setting: see
xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc#index-fragmentation[Index Fragmentation].
Note, however, that the index-fragmentation data-size is not significantly changed by compaction.

[[compaction]]Append-only Write Mode:: Writes changes to the end of the index-file, invalidating existing pages within the index file, and requiring frequent, full compaction.

By default, Couchbase Server Community Edition uses Circular Write Mode for standard index storage.
Append-only Write Mode is provided for backwards compatibility with previous versions.

Other storage-settings are described in detail in xref:manage:manage-settings/configure-compact-settings.adoc[Configuring Auto-Compaction].

== Changing Index-Storage Settings

Settings are established at cluster-initialization for all indexes on the cluster, across all buckets.
Following cluster-initialization, to change from one setting to the other, all nodes running the Index Service must be removed.
If the cluster is single-node, uninstall and reinstall Couchbase Server.
If the cluster is multi-node, and only some of the nodes host the Index Service, proceed as follows:

. Identify the nodes running the Index Service.
. Remove each of the nodes running the Index Service.
Note that as Index-Service nodes are removed, so are the indexes they contain; and in consequence, any ongoing queries fail.
. Perform a rebalance.
. Change the Index-Storage Settings for the cluster.
. Add new Index-Service nodes, and confirm the revised storage mode.

For information on adding and removing nodes, and on rebalancing a cluster, see
xref:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[Manage
Nodes and Clusters].
