= Availability and Performance
:page-aliases: indexes:index-replication,indexes:performance-consistency,understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/indexes/index-replication

[abstract]
The _Index Service_ ensures availability and performance through _replication_ and _partitioning_.
The _consistency_ of query-results can be controlled per query.

== Index Replication

Secondary indexes can be replicated across cluster-nodes.
This ensures:

* _Availability_: If one Index-Service node is lost, the other continues to provide access to replicated indexes.
* _High Performance_: If original and replica copies are available, incoming queries are load-balanced across them.

Index-replicas can be created with the N1QL `CREATE INDEX` statement.
Note that whenever a given number of index-replicas is specified for creation, the number must be less than the number of cluster-nodes currently running the xref:services-and-indexes/services/index-service.adoc[Index Service].
If it is not, the index-creation fails.
Note also that if, following creation of the maximum number of copies, the number of nodes running the Index Service decreases, Couchbase Server progressively assigns replacement index-replicas to any and all Index-Service nodes subsequently be added to the cluster, until the required number of index-replicas again exists for each replicated index.

Index-replicas can be created as follows:

* Specifying, by means of the `WITH` clause, the destination nodes.
In the following example, an index with two replicas is created.
The active index is on `node1`, and the replicas are on `node2` and `node3`:
+
[#nodes-example2]
----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
    WHERE type="product" USING GSI
    WITH {"nodes":["node1:8091", "node2:8091", "node3:8091"]};
----

* Specifying _no_ destination nodes; but specifying instead, by means of the `WITH` clause and the `num_replica` attribute, only the _number_ of replicas required.
The replicas are automatically distributed across those nodes of the cluster that are running the Index Service: the distribution-pattern is based on a projection of optimal index-availability, given the number and disposition of Index-Service nodes across defined server-groups.
+
In the following example, an index is created with two replicas, with no destination-nodes specified:
+
----
CREATE INDEX productName_index1 ON bucket_name(productName, ProductID)
    WHERE type="product" USING GSI
    WITH {"num_replica": 2};
----
+
Note that if `nodes` and `num_replica` are both specified in the `WITH` clause, the specified number of nodes must be _one greater_ than `num_replica`.

* Specifying a number of index-replicas to be created by the Index Service whenever `CREATE INDEX` is invoked.
The default is `0`.
If the default is changed to, say, `2`, creation of a single index is henceforth accompanied by the creation of two replicas, which are automatically distributed across the nodes of the cluster running the Index Service.
No explicit specification within the `CREATE INDEX` statement is required.
+
With credentials that provide appropriate authorization, this default can be changed; by means of the `curl` command, as follows:
+
----
curl -u <username>:<password> <host>:9102/settings -d "{\"indexer.settings.num_replica\": <num_replicas>}"
----
+
Note, however, that whenever explicit specification of replica-numbers is made within the `CREATE INDEX` statement, this explicit specification takes precedence over any established default.

== Index Partitioning

_Index Partitioning_ increases aggregate query performance, by dividing and spreading a large index of documents across multiple nodes. This feature is available only in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

The benefits include:

* The ability to scale out horizontally, as index size increases.

* Transparency to queries, requiring no change to existing queries.

* Reduction of query latency for large, aggregated queries; since partitions can be scanned in parallel.

* Provision of a low-latency range query, while allowing indexes to be scaled out as needed.

For detailed information, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index-partitioning.adoc[Index Partitioning].

== Index Consistency

Whereas Couchbase Server handles data-mutations with _full consistency_ — all mutations to a given key are applied to the same vBucket, and become immediately available — it maintains indexes with degrees of _eventual consistency_, determined by means of the following query consistency-options, specified per query:

* `not_bounded`: Executes the query immediately, without requiring any consistency for the query.
If index-maintenance is running behind, out-of-date results may be returned.
* `at_plus`: Executes the query, requiring indexes first to be updated to the timestamp of the last update.
If index-maintenance is running behind, the query waits for it to catch up.
* `request_plus`: Executes the query, requiring the indexes first to be updated to the timestamp of the current query-request.
If index-maintenance is running behind, the query waits for it to catch up.

For N1QL, the default consistency is `not_bounded`.
