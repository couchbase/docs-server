:description: An overview of the lifecycle of a Global Secondary Index, from creation and building to updates and scans.

[abstract]
{description}

In Couchbase Server 7.0 and later, a Global Secondary Index is created on a single collection -- not on an entire bucket.
(A collection may, of course, have multiple indexes.)
By carefully planning the structure of your data, and storing documents of different types in separate collections, you can improve performance at every stage in the lifecycle of an index.

== Index Building

The client issues a request to build an index on a collection.

. The projector requests a DCP stream on the specified collection.
. DCP streams only the documents in the collection.
. The projector evaluates each document and extracts the indexed field(s).
. The indexed fields are forwarded to the indexer.

Refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#index-building[Index Building] for further details.

== Index Updates

When a Global Secondary Index has been created on a collection, the index is updated when documents within the collection are updated.

. The projector keeps a _bucket-level_ DCP stream open for updates -- this limits the number of DCP connections.
. When a document within the collection is updated, the projector utilizes the collection ID available with each mutation, and only evaluates the indexes defined for that collection.
. The projector only sends updated indexed fields for the qualified indexes within the collection.

There is no additional processing or disk overhead for indexes on unrelated collections.

== Index Scans

When a query needs to make use of a Global Secondary Index, the index is scanned.

* If the index consistency is `not_bounded`, the scan proceeds without waiting for the index to be updated.
* If the scan consistency is `at_plus` or `request_plus`, the scan coordinator waits for the index to be updated for that collection only, and then performs the scan.

The scan coordinator does not need to wait for indexes on other collections to be updated, even if documents in other collections are being mutated.
