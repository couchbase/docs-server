[abstract]
{description} Services
can be deployed with flexibility across available hardware-resources, providing
_Multi-Dimensional Scaling_, whereby a cluster can be tuned for optimal
handling of emergent workloads.

Services are configured and deployed by the Full Administrator who initializes Couchbase Server on one or more nodes.
The standard configuration-sequence allows a subset of services to be selected per node, with an individual memory-allocation for each.
Each service supports a particular form of data-access.
Services not required need not be deployed.
Services intended to support a heavy workload can be deployed across multiple cluster-nodes, to ensure optimal performance and resource-availability.

== Services and Multi-Dimensional Scaling

Couchbase Server provides the following services:

* *Data*: Supports the storing, setting, and retrieving of data-items, specified by key.
* *Query*: Parses queries specified in the _N1QL_ query-language, executes the queries, and returns results.
The Query Service interacts with both the Data and Index services.
* *Index*: Creates indexes, for use by the Query and Analytics services.
* *Search*: Create indexes specially purposed for _Full Text Search_.
This supports language-aware searching; allowing users to search for, say, the word `beauties`, and additionally obtain results for `beauty` and `beautiful`.
* *Analytics*: Supports join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations; which are expected to be large, long-running, and highly consumptive of memory and CPU resources.
* *Eventing*: Supports near real-time handling of changes to data: code can be executed both in response to document-mutations, and as scheduled by timers.
* *Backup*: Supports the scheduling of full and incremental data backups, either for specific individual buckets, or for all buckets on the cluster.
Also allows the scheduling of _merges_ of previously made backups.

These services can be deployed, maintained, and provisioned independently of
one another, by means of _Multi-Dimensional Scaling_, to ensure the most
effective ongoing response to changing business conditions and emergent
workload-requirements.

[#setting-up-services]
== Setting Up Services

Services are set up on a per node basis.
Each node can run at most one instance of a service.
The _Data Service_ must run on at least one node.
Some services are interdependent, and therefore require at least one instance of
each of their dependencies to be running on the cluster (for example, the
_Query Service_ depends on the _Index Service_ and on the _Data Service_).

When the first node in a cluster is initialized, the services assigned to it become the default assignment for each other node subsequently to be added to the cluster.
However, this default can be departed from, node by node; with one or more services omitted from the default, and one or more added.

When first allocated to a node, a service requires the assignment of a specific memory quota, which becomes standard for that service in each of its instances across the cluster.
(The exception to this is the Query Service, which never requires a memory quota.)

Service-allocation should be designed based on workload-analysis: if a particular service is expected to handle a heavy workload, it should be allocated with a larger memory quota, and potentially as the only service on the node.
Alternatively, if a cluster is to be used for development purposes only, it may be convenient to allocate services in the quickest and most convenient way, with some quotas being equal.

For example, the following illustration shows how four services — Data, Index, Query, and Search — might be allocated evenly across the five nodes of a _development_ cluster:

[#cb_cluster_with_services_development]
image::services-and-indexes/services/cbClusterWithServicesDevelopment.png[,720,align=left]

This configuration might provide perfectly acceptable performance for each of the four services, in the context of development and testing.
However, if a large amount of data needed, in production, to be intensively indexed, and addressed by means of Query and Search, the following configuration would be more efficient:

[#cb_cluster_with_services_production]
image::services-and-indexes/services/cbClusterWithServicesProductionV2.png[,720,align=left]

In this revised configuration, the Data Service is the only service to run on two of the nodes.
The Data Service also runs on a third node, which it shares with the Index Service.
Additionally, the Index Service is the only service to run on the fourth node; and the Query and Search Services share the fifth and final node.

[#multi-dimensional-scaling]
== Multi-Dimensional Scaling

The ability to deploy Couchbase Services with flexibility across hardware-resources
supports _Multi-Dimensional Scaling_, whereby a cluster can be fine-tuned for
optimal handling of emergent workload-requirements. If, for example, a greater
Search workload-requirement is encountered, one or more existing non-Search
nodes can be removed, reconfigured to run the Search Service, and re-added to the
cluster.

Alternatively, additional hardware-resources (CPU, memory, disk-capacity) can be
added to targeted nodes in the cluster, in order to support the performance of
key services. This ability to provision services independently from one another, and
thereby
scale their performance individually up and down as required, provides the greatest
flexibility in terms of handling changing business requirements, and redeploying
existing resources to ensure continuously heightened efficiency.
