= Eventing Service

[abstract]
The _Eventing Service_ provides near real-time handling of changes to data; whereby code is executed either in response to mutations, or as scheduled by timers.

== Understanding Eventing

The _Eventing Service_ allows functions to be written, saved, and triggered in response to events.
Events include changes made to specified items, and the arrival of scheduled points-in-time.

The Eventing Service depends on the xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data Service], which must therefore be running on at least one cluster node.

For information on using the Eventing Service, see xref:eventing:eventing-overview.adoc[Eventing Service: Fundamentals].
