== Understanding Analytics

The Analytics Service supports large _join_, _set_, _aggregation_, and _grouping_ operations: these activities are anticipated often to employ large amounts of data, and therefore to be highly consumptive of processor, networking, and memory resources; highly demanding in terms of cross-node coordination; and of extensive duration.

_Analytic queries_ can be either _predetermined_ or _ad hoc_; _predetermined_ queries often providing greater efficiency.
The Analytics Service further enhances efficiency by supporting parallel query-processing and bulk data-handling; and by allowing analytic queries to be run on _indexes_.

== Deploying the Analytics Service

The Analytics Service relies on the xref:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Data Service], which must therefore be running on at least one of the cluster nodes.

Due to the large scale and duration of operations it is likely to perform, the Analytics Service should be run _alone, on its own cluster node, with no other Couchbase Service running on that node_.

For the practical steps required to initialize or join a cluster, and to deploy services, see
xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster].
For information on how to run analytic queries, see the xref:analytics:introduction.adoc[Introduction] to Couchbase Analytics.
