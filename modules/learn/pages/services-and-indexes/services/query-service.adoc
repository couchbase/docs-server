{description}
The Query Service depends on both the _Index Service_ and the _Data Service_.

== Query Service Architecture

The architecture of the _Query Service_ is shown by the following illustration:

[#query_service_architecture]
image::services-and-indexes/services/queryServiceArchitecture.png[,700,align=left]

The principal components are:

* *Listeners*: Concurrent query requests are received on ports 8093 and 18093 (for more information on port-allocation, see xref:install:install-ports.adoc[Network and
Firewall Requirements]).
* *Query Processor*: Responsible for applying the *Parser* to incoming queries, in order to determine whether each is a valid statement.
Also employs the *Optimizer*, which evaluates available execution paths, so determining the path of lowest latency; generates a query-execution plan that uses the lowest-latency path; and assembles the plan into a series of operators.
The *Execution Engine* receives the operators, and executes them — in parallel where possible.
* *Data Stores*: Provides access to various data-sources.
The *Couchbase Server* store is used to access the data and indexes on Couchbase Server, and to handle authentication.
Other data stores are also included, such as the store for the local filesystem.

== Query Execution

The sequence whereby queries are executed is shown below:

[#query_sequence]
image::services-and-indexes/services/querySequence.png[,820,align=left]

The client's {sqlpp} query is shown entering the Query Service at the left-hand side.
The Query Processor performs its *Parse* routine, to validate the submitted statement, then creates the execution *Plan*.
*Scan* operations are then performed on the relevant index, by accessing the *Index Service* or the *Search Service*.
Next, *Fetch* operations are performed by accessing the *Data Service*, and the data duly returned is used in *Join* operations.
The Query Service continues by performing additional processing, which includes *Filter*, *Aggregate*, and *Sort* operations.
Note the degree of parallelism with which operations are frequently performed, represented by the vertically aligned groups of right-pointing arrows.

== Using {sqlpp}

The Query Service supports queries made in {sqlpp}.
As well as providing a rich variety of query-options, {sqlpp} allows statements to be _prepared_, so that the parsing and compiling of plans is completed prior to execution; and permits _consistency-levels_ to be configured.
For detailed information, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[{sqlpp} Language Reference].
