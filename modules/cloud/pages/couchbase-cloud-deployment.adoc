== Couchbase on Kubernetes

https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes^] has become and increasingly popular platform for deploying applications in the cloud. With its cloud-agnostic model, Kubernetes allows your applications to be more portable between clouds, saving you the extra time and resources that normally result from vendor lock-in.

The xref:operator:ROOT:overview.adoc[Couchbase Autonomous Operator] provides a native integration of Couchbase Server with Kubernetes platforms. It enables you to automate the management of common Couchbase tasks such as the configuration, creation, scaling, and recovery of Couchbase clusters.
