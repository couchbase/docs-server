. This will open up gcloud shell. Type the following commands  to create a Compute Engine
+
[source,gcloud]
----
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
----


. Create an instance called in-1 on us-east1-b-zone with http-server tag as enabled.
+
[source,gcloud]
----
gcloud compute instances create in-1 --zone us-east1-b --tags=http-server
----

. Login into the compute instance as follows:
+
[source,gcloud]
----
gcloud compute ssh in-1 --zone=us-east1-b
----

. Set the swappiness to zero as follows:
+
[source,Debian]
----
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0
----

. Initialize the cluster as follows:
+
[source,Debian]
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli cluster-init --cluster localhost:8091 --cluster-username Administrator --cluster-password password --cluster-ramsize 1024 --cluster-index-ramsize 1024 --services data,index,query
----

. Exit from the compute instance.
+
----
exit
----

. Create a firewall rule as follows:
+
----
gcloud compute firewall-rules create http-allow --allow all
----

. Note the external IP as follows:
+
----
gcloud compute instances list --zones=us-east1-b
----
