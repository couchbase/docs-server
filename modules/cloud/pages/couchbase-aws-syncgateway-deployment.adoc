= Deploy Couchbase Sync Gateway Using AWS Marketplace
:description: Couchbase partners with Amazon to provide a packaged solution on AWS Marketplace.

[abstract]
{description}

This solution is based on Amazon CloudFormation templates that incorporate the latest features and best practices for deploying Couchbase Server on Amazon Web Services.

Couchbase Sync Gateway on AWS Marketplace provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to get up and running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
At the core of this experience are Amazon CloudFormation templates that are developed in close collaboration with Amazon in order to adopt the latest features and best practices.
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) also provide the information required to launch an instance of a virtual server in AWS,
thus making it easier and faster to deploy Couchbase Sync Gateway without having to create and manage schemas, or normalize, shard, and tune the database.

Couchbase Sync Gateway is available through AWS Marketplace with hourly pricing, or through a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model.


== Prerequisites

* You need an AWS account.
If you don't have one, https://aws.amazon.com/[sign up^] for one before proceeding.
* You should review the xref:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc#aws-best-practices[best practices] for deploying Couchbase Server on AWS.
* A Couchbase Server cluster deployed and running. 
You need the Cluster DNS or IP address where the server is running, the Couchbase username, Couchbase password. 
You also need the name of the bucket configured to use with Couchbase Sync Gateway. 
* If you have deployed the Couchbase cluster via the AWS Marketplace experience, you can get the Cluster DNS/IP from this xref:couchbase-aws-marketplace.adoc#logging-in[step]. 
Follow the steps documented xref:sync-gateway:get-started-prepare.adoc#step-1create-a-bucket[here] to configure the server to work with Couchbase Sync Gateway. 
The main steps are setting up the bucket, setting up an RBAC user, and ensuring that the network access is set up correctly.
