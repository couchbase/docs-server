. Enter the stack name and parameter values.
You can choose to use the default values defined in the AWS CloudFormation template or edit them.
Then click [.ui]*Next*.

[#logging-in]
== Logging in to Your Couchbase Cluster

After the deployment is completed, you can explore the resources created from the AWS EC2 dashboard.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-dashboard.png[,570]

Click [.ui]*Running Instances* under Resources to view the running instances of Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway.
You can select a particular instance to view details such as the instance ID, state, IPv4 Public IP, and so on.

[#ol_xz2_vsn_nbb]
. This step describes how to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
[#ol_qrc_x5n_nbb]
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Server Instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-couchbase-server-instance-public-ip.png[,570]
 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 8091 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:8091_ to open the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Enter the Administrator user name and password you configured when creating the stack to sign in.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-ee-login.png[,570]
 .. Once you log in successfully, you can see the status of your Couchbase Server cluster on the dashboard.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-web-console-dashboard.png[,570]

. This step describes how to log in to the Sync Gateway Admin portal.
[#ol_qs2_hxn_nbb]
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Sync Gateway instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-sync-gateway-instance-public-ip.png[,570]
 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 4984 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:4984_.
This opens the interface for Couchbase Sync Gateway which is already setup and configured to connect to an empty bucket on the cluster.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-sync-gateway-connection.png[,570]
 .. Open another browser tab and enter [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:4984/_admin/_ to open the Couchbase Sync Gateway Admin Portal.

[#scaling]
== Scaling Your Couchbase Cluster

This section describes how to scale up your cluster in three simple steps.

[#ol_fnc_myn_nbb]
. Log in to the AWS EC2 Console and select [.ui]*Instances* in the left navigation to list all the available instances.
Select the Couchbase Server instance you wish to scale up.
image:aws/scaling/aws-ec2-network-interfaces-couchbase-server-instance.png[,570]
. On left navigation, select [.ui]*Auto Scaling Groups*.
image:aws/scaling/aws-ec2-couchbase-server-auto-scaling-options.png[,570]
