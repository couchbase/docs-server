= Deploy Couchbase Server Using AWS Marketplace
:description: Couchbase partners with Amazon to provide a packaged solution on AWS Marketplace.

[abstract]
{description}
This solution is based on Amazon CloudFormation templates that incorporate the latest features and best practices for deploying Couchbase Server on Amazon Web Services.

Couchbase Server on AWS Marketplace provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to get up and running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
At the core of this experience are Amazon CloudFormation templates that are developed in close collaboration with Amazon in order to adopt the latest features and best practices.
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) also provide the information required to launch an instance of a virtual server in AWS,
thus making it easier and faster to deploy Couchbase Server without having to create and manage schemas, or normalize, shard, and tune the database.

Couchbase is available through AWS Marketplace with hourly pricing, or through a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model.

== Before You Begin

* You need an AWS account.
If you don't have one, https://aws.amazon.com/[sign up^] for one before proceeding.
* You should review the xref:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc#aws-best-practices[best practices] for deploying Couchbase Server on AWS.

.. Enter the *Core Server Configuration* parameters. Other than specifying the database user name and password, you can choose to use the default values defined in the AWS CloudFormation template or edit them. 
+
NOTE: The user name and password will be required to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console later.

. This step describes how to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Server Instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
+

 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 8091 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:8091_ to open the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Enter the database administrator user name and password you configured when creating the stack to sign in.
+
