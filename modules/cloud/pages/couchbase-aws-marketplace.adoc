= Deploy Couchbase Server Using AWS Marketplace
:description: Couchbase partners with Amazon to provide a packaged solution on AWS Marketplace.

[abstract]
{description}
This solution is based on Amazon CloudFormation templates that incorporate the latest features and best practices for deploying Couchbase Server on Amazon Web Services.

Couchbase Server on AWS Marketplace provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to get up and running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
At the core of this experience are Amazon CloudFormation templates that are developed in close collaboration with Amazon in order to adopt the latest features and best practices.
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) also provide the information required to launch an instance of a virtual server in AWS,
thus making it easier and faster to deploy Couchbase Server without having to create and manage schemas, or normalize, shard, and tune the database.

Couchbase is available through AWS Marketplace with hourly pricing, or through a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model.

== Before You Begin

* You need an AWS account.
If you don't have one, https://aws.amazon.com/[sign up^] for one before proceeding.
* You should review the xref:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc#aws-best-practices[best practices] for deploying Couchbase Server on AWS.

== Deploying Couchbase Enterprise

IMPORTANT: The CloudFormation templates are provided as a starting point and may be customized as needed.
Note that additional post deployment setup may be required.

. Log in to your account on the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[Amazon Web Services Marketplace^], search for [.in]`Couchbase` and select Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
Alternately, you can click https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/pp/prodview-2qb6yl6xq2one[here^] to go to the Couchbase Enterprise Edition product page directly.
. The Couchbase Enterprise product page provides a quick overview of the product offering and useful links.

. You will be redirected to the AWS CloudFormation Console where you must create a stack.
A stack is a group of related resources that you manage as a single unit.
Select the [.in]`Amazon S3 template URL` and then click [.ui]*Next*.
+

. Enter the stack name and parameter values.
You can choose to use the default values defined in the AWS CloudFormation template or edit them.
Then click [.ui]*Next*.
+
NOTE: The user name and password will be required to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console later.

. Optionally, you can specify tags for resources in your stack and the required permissions.
Click [.ui]*Next*.
+

. Acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation may create IAM resources that provide entities access to make changes to your AWS account and click [.ui]*Create*.
+

[#logging-in]
== Logging in to Your Couchbase Cluster

After the deployment is completed, you can explore the resources created from the AWS EC2 dashboard.

image::aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-dashboard.png[,570]

Click [.ui]*Running Instances* under Resources to view the running instances of Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway.
You can select a particular instance to view details such as the instance ID, state, IPv4 Public IP, and so on.

image::aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-instances.png[,570]

. This step describes how to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Server Instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
+
image::aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-couchbase-server-instance-public-ip.png[,570]

 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 8091 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:8091_ to open the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Enter the Administrator user name and password you configured when creating the stack to sign in.
+
image::aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-ee-login.png[,570]

 .. Once you log in successfully, you can see the status of your Couchbase Server cluster on the dashboard.
+

+
Click the [.ui]*Servers* tab to explore the sever nodes that have been created.
+
image::aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-web-console-servers.png[,570]
. This step describes how to log in to the Sync Gateway Admin portal.
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Sync Gateway instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
+
image::aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-sync-gateway-instance-public-ip.png[,570]

 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 4984 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:4984_.
This opens the interface for Couchbase Sync Gateway which is already setup and configured to connect to an empty bucket on the cluster.
+

[#scaling]
== Scaling Your Couchbase Cluster

This section describes how to scale up your cluster in three simple steps.

. Log in to the AWS EC2 Console and select [.ui]*Instances* in the left navigation to list all the available instances.
Select the Couchbase Server instance you wish to scale up.
+
