= Deploying Couchbase from AWS Marketplace

== Prerequisites

* You must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.
If not, create one https://aws.amazon.com[here] before proceeding.
For information on how to do so, see the AWS documentation for http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutAWSAccounts.html[Creating an AWS Account].

NOTE: The command line examples that begin with $ are run in a standard Linux shell.

== Deploying Couchbase Enterprise

IMPORTANT: The CloudFormation templates are provided as a starting point and may be customized as needed.
Note that additional post deployment setup may be required.

. Log in to your account on the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[Amazon Web Services Marketplace], search for [.input]`Couchbase` and select Couchbase Enterprise Edition.
Alternately, you can click https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/pp/prodview-2qb6yl6xq2one[here] to go to the Couchbase Enterprise Edition product page directly.
. The Couchbase Enterprise product page provides a quick overview of the product offering and useful links.

. You will be redirected to the AWS CloudFormation Console where you must create a stack.
A stack is a group of related resources that you manage as a single unit.
Select the [.input]`Amazon S3 template URL` and then click [.uicontrol]*Next*.image:aws/deploying/aws-marketplace-couchbase-ee-create-stack-select-template.png[,570]
. Enter the stack name and parameter values.
You can choose to use the default values defined in the AWS CloudFormation template or edit them.
Then click [.uicontrol]*Next*.

NOTE: The user name and password will be required to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console later.

. Optionally, you can specify tags for resources in your stack and the required permissions.
Click [.uicontrol]*Next*.image:aws/deploying/aws-marketplace-couchbase-ee-create-stack-options.png[,570]
. Acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation may create IAM resources that provide entities access to make changes to your AWS account and click [.uicontrol]*Create*.

. The stack creation takes a short while to complete and the status is displayed on the screen.
After the process is completed, you should see a [.output]`CREATE_COMPLETE` status.

[#logging-in]
== Logging in to Your Couchbase Cluster

After the deployment is completed, you can explore the resources created from the AWS EC2 dashboard.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-dashboard.png[,570]

Click [.uicontrol]*Running Instances* under Resources to view the running instances of Couchbase Server and Sync Gateway.
You can select a particular instance to view details such as the instance ID, state, IPv4 Public IP, and so on.

[#ol_xz2_vsn_nbb]
. This step describes how to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
[#ol_qrc_x5n_nbb]
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Server Instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-couchbase-server-instance-public-ip.png[,570]
 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 8091 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:8091_ to open the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Enter the Administrator user name and password you configured when creating the stack to sign in.image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-ee-login.png[,570]
 .. Once you log in successfully, you can see the status of your Couchbase Server cluster on the dashboard.image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-web-console-dashboard.png[,570]

Click the [.uicontrol]*Servers* tab to explore the sever nodes that have been created.image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-web-console-servers.png[,570]
. This step describes how to log in to the Sync Gateway Admin portal.
[#ol_qs2_hxn_nbb]
 .. From the AWS EC2 console, select a running Couchbase Sync Gateway instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.image:aws/logging-in/aws-console-ec2-sync-gateway-instance-public-ip.png[,570]
 .. Open a browser tab and enter the copied IPv4 Public IP along with port 4984 as [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:4984_.
This opens the interface for Couchbase Sync Gateway which is already setup and configured to connect to an empty bucket on the cluster.
image:aws/logging-in/aws-couchbase-sync-gateway-connection.png[,570]
 .. Open another browser tab and enter [.path]_<ipv4-public-ip>:4984/_admin/_ to open the Couchbase Sync Gateway Admin Portal.

[#scaling]
== Scaling Your Couchbase Cluster

This section describes how to scale up your cluster in three simple steps.

[#ol_fnc_myn_nbb]
. Log in to the AWS EC2 Console and select [.uicontrol]*Instances* in the left navigation to list all the available instances.
Select the Couchbase Server instance you wish to scale up.
image:aws/scaling/aws-ec2-network-interfaces-couchbase-server-instance.png[,570]
. On left navigation, select [.uicontrol]*Auto Scaling Groups*.
image:aws/scaling/aws-ec2-couchbase-server-auto-scaling-options.png[,570]
. Edit the selected Auto Scaling Group and then [.uicontrol]*Save*.
In the following screen captures, you'll see that the number of server instances has been updated from 4 to 8.
