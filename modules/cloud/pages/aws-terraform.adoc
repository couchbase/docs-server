= Deploy Couchbase Server Using Terraform on AWS
:description: Deploy Couchbase Server using Terraform modules developed by Gruntwork, a Couchbase technology partner.

https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html[Terraform^] is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technology that allows you to build, version, and deploy your datacenter resources in a descriptive manner, much like software source code.
This makes Terraform uniquely suited for deploying Couchbase on AWS, because you can quickly organize and execute infrastructure code that maintains a Couchbase cloud environment to your exact specifications.

== Getting Started

The best way to use Terraform with Couchbase is through the creation of _modules_.

____
Modules are logical groupings of Terraform configuration files.
Modules are intended to be shared and re-used across projects, but can also be used within a project to help better structure a complex service [like a distributed database] that includes many infrastructure components.

To get you started quickly, and to avoid creating your own Terraform modules from scratch, https://www.gruntwork.io/[Gruntwork^] (a Couchbase technology partner) has developed a set of fully-featured, open source modules that define an ideal set of infrastructure components for Couchbase.
These modules support features like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR), and even include a full test suite.

Get started with Terraform modules from Gruntwork, available on https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-couchbase[GitHub^].
