= Deploying Couchbase from Azure Marketplace

== Prerequisites

* Microsoft Azure Account - If you don't have an account, you can create one https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[here^].
* Sufficient Core Quota - The Azure Free Trial is a great way to get started.
However, it has a core quota of 4 cores per region.
Upgrading the trial to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription will increase that quota to 10 cores.
Additionally, for a Pay-As-You-Go subscription you can open a support ticket in the Azure Portal to request a quota increase beyond the 10 core default.
An Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) has a 200 core quota by default.

== Deploying Couchbase Enterprise

IMPORTANT: The templates are provided as a starting point and may be customized as needed.
Note that additional post deployment setup may be required.

. Log in to your account on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
. Search for [.in]`Couchbase` in the Marketplace and select the Couchbase Enterprise app.

. To deploy Couchbase Enterprise on Microsoft Azure, click [.ui]*Get it Now*.
+
There are two https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise?tab=PlansAndPrice[plans^] that you can choose from: BYOL and Hourly Pricing.

. Once you select a plan (we've selected Hourly Pricing for this example), you are redirected to portal.azure.com.
If you're not already logged in to Azure Portal, you will need to authenticate yourself before proceeding to the next step.

[#logging-in]
== Logging in to Your Couchbase Cluster

After the deployment is completed, you can drill-down into the resource group and explore the items created.
The newly created resource group contains four items: network security groups, Couchbase Server VM scale sets, Couchbase Sync Gateway VM scale sets, and a virtual network that contains all these objects.

[#image_gzk_dsn_nbb]
image::azure/logging-in/azure-cb-rg-cluster-overview.png[,570]

Navigate to the newly created resource group > [.ui]*Deployments* and select the deployment.
(For example, [.in]`couchbase.couchbase-enterprisecouchbase-enterpris-timestamp`).
You can see that there are two outputs created: Server Admin URL and Sync Gateway Admin URL which can be used to access the Couchbase Server Web Console and Couchbase Sync Gateway Admin Portal respectively.

[#scaling]
== Scaling Your Couchbase Cluster

Couchbase simplifies scaling on Microsoft Azure by using virtual machine scale sets.
This section describes how to scale up your cluster in three simple steps.

[#ol_fnc_myn_nbb]
. Log in to the Microsoft Azure Portal and navigate to your deployed Couchbase cluster > your Couchbase resource group > server VM scale set.
+
[#image_bjw_wzn_nbb]
image::azure/scaling/azure-cb-cluster-vm-server.png[,570]

. Click [.ui]*Scaling* under Settings and move the slider on the instance count up (or down) as needed.
+
[#image_ag3_p14_nbb]
image::azure/scaling/azure-cb-vm-server-scaling-save-new-config.png[,570]

. Click [.ui]*Save*.
You'll see a notification that the autoscale configuration is being updated.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not enable autoscale.
+
Go to Instances to see the updated instance count.
In a few minutes, the additional instances will be up and running.
+
[#image_ezj_fb4_nbb]
image::azure/scaling/azure-cb-vm-server-instances.png[,570]
+
On a different browser tab, you can log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console to see the additional server nodes that were added to your cluster.
