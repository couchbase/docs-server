= Deploy Couchbase Server Using Azure Marketplace
:description: Couchbase partners with Microsoft to provide a packaged solution on Azure Marketplace.

[abstract]
{description}
This solution is based on Azure Resource Manager templates that incorporate the latest features and best practices for deploying Couchbase Server on Microsoft Azure.

Couchbase Server on Azure Marketplace provides one of the fastest and easiest ways to get up and running on Azure virtual machines.
At the core of this experience are Azure Resource Manager templates that are developed in close collaboration with Microsoft in order to adopt the latest features and best practices.

Couchbase is available through Azure Marketplace with hourly pricing, or through a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model.

== Before You Begin

* You need a Microsoft Azure account.
If you don't have one, https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[sign up^] for one before proceeding.
* You should review the xref:couchbase-cloud-deployment.adoc#azure-best-practices[best practices] for deploying Couchbase Server on Azure.
+
NOTE: The free trial version of Azure has limits on the number of resources that can be be deployed.
Upgrading to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription will increase resource quotas, and it also allows you to open a support ticket in the Azure portal to request even higher quotas should you need them.

== Deploying Couchbase Enterprise

IMPORTANT: The templates are provided as a starting point and may be customized as needed.
Note that additional post deployment setup may be required.

. Log in to your account on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.
. Search for [.in]`Couchbase` in the Marketplace and select the Couchbase Enterprise app.

. To deploy Couchbase Enterprise on Microsoft Azure, click [.ui]*Get it Now*.
+
There are two https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise?tab=PlansAndPrice[plans^] that you can choose from: BYOL and Hourly Pricing.

. Once you select a plan (we've selected Hourly Pricing for this example), you are redirected to portal.azure.com.
If you're not already logged in to Azure Portal, you will need to authenticate yourself before proceeding to the next step.

[#logging-in]
== Logging in to Your Couchbase Cluster

After the deployment is completed, you can drill-down into the resource group and explore the items created.
The newly created resource group contains four items: network security groups, Couchbase Server VM scale sets, Couchbase Sync Gateway VM scale sets, and a virtual network that contains all these objects.

image::azure/logging-in/azure-cb-rg-cluster-overview.png[,570]

Navigate to the newly created resource group > [.ui]*Deployments* and select the deployment.
(For example, [.in]`couchbase.couchbase-enterprisecouchbase-enterpris-timestamp`).
You can see that there are two outputs created: Server Admin URL and Sync Gateway Admin URL which can be used to access the Couchbase Server Web Console and Couchbase Sync Gateway Admin Portal respectively.

. This step describes how to log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Copy the Server Admin URL.

 .. Paste the Server Admin URL on a browser tab to open the Couchbase Server Web Console.
 .. Enter the Admin user name and password that you configured when creating the deployment to sign in.

[#scaling]
== Scaling Your Couchbase Cluster

Couchbase simplifies scaling on Microsoft Azure by using virtual machine scale sets.
This section describes how to scale up your cluster in three simple steps.

. Log in to the Microsoft Azure Portal and navigate to your deployed Couchbase cluster > your Couchbase resource group > server VM scale set.
+
image::azure/scaling/azure-cb-cluster-vm-server.png[,570]

. Click [.ui]*Scaling* under Settings and move the slider on the instance count up (or down) as needed.
+
image::azure/scaling/azure-cb-vm-server-scaling-save-new-config.png[,570]

. Click [.ui]*Save*.
You'll see a notification that the autoscale configuration is being updated.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not enable autoscale.
+
Go to Instances to see the updated instance count.
In a few minutes, the additional instances will be up and running.
+

+
On a different browser tab, you can log in to the Couchbase Server Web Console to see the additional server nodes that were added to your cluster.
