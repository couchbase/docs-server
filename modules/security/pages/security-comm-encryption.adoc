= Encryption on the Wire

[abstract]
Couchbase encrypts the data moving between client and server, between servers within a cluster, and between data centers.

== Data moving between client and server

NOTE: With 4.0, Couchbase uses the TLS protocol by default for encrypted interactions.
The server supports both TLS 1.0-1.2 for XDCR.
Which version it uses depends on the source and target clusters.

Secure administrative access:: Couchbase Server also includes support for secure administrative access, which enables administrators to administer the server securely through the browser using a public network.

Secure data access:: When you enable SSL/TLS, data in transit to and from the server is encrypted using the server certificate configured and stored in the client certificate store.

== Data Moving Between Servers within a Cluster

If you encrypt all your sensitive data in the documents, the replica copies will be transmitted as is (encrypted) and stored.
For added security, it is a good security practice to use IPSec on the network that connects the Couchbase server nodes.

== Data Moving Between Data Centers

xref:xdcr:xdcr-data-encryption.adoc[Secure XDCR] enables you to encrypt traffic between two data centers using an SSL/TLS connection.
When you use secure XDCR, all traffic in the source and destination data centers will be encrypted.
Encryption causes a slight increase in the CPU load to allow for additional CPU cycles.

It is a good security practice to rotate the XDCR certificates periodically, as per your organization's security policy.

== Disabling the Couchbase Web Console on Port 8091

If you would like to force Administrators to log in to the UI over an encrypted channel, you can disable the UI over the 8091 HTTP port, so that administrators can only access the administrative web console over port 18091.

[caption=Remember]
IMPORTANT: This setting does not disable port 8091 completely since port 8091 is an important Couchbase port that also handles REST requests in addition to the Couchbase Web Console.

To disable the Couchbase Web Console over port 8091:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval \
          -d 'ns_config:set(disable_ui_over_http, true)’
----

To re-enable the Couchbase Web Console over port 8091:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval \
          -d 'ns_config:set(disable_ui_over_http, false)’
----
