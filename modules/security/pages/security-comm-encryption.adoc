= Encryption on the Wire

[abstract]
Data _on the wire_ needs to be protected from eavesdropping.
Therefore, Couchbase Server uses _SSL/TLS_ to encrypt data passed in each of the following ways: between clients and servers; between server-nodes within a cluster; and between data centers.

[#securing-administrative-access]
== Securing Administrator-Access

Full Administrators can configure administrative access so that client-communications with Couchbase Server are encrypted, by means of SSL/TLS.
This protocol is fully supported by the Couchbase client-libraries for both the Couchbase Web Console and the REST API.

When securely initialized, Couchbase Server generates a self-signed certificate for the initial node, which is then propagated throughout all the nodes in the cluster.
In terms of security-strength, this certificate is presumed to be adequate for your pre-production activities: optionally, however, you can switch to an _X.509_ certificate, before you deploy your application into production.
See xref:security-x509certsintro.adoc#configuring-x.509[Configuring X.509].

[#conecting-securely-to-the-console]
== Connecting Securely to the Console

The Couchbase Web Console can be accessed over HTTPS, on port `18091`.
Since it is protected by SSL/TLS, this connection is secure.

For example, if you have established the Couchbase Web Console on `http://`_servername_`:8091`, you can access it securely on `https://`_servername_`:18091`.

[#performing-certificate-verification]
== Performing Certificate Verification

To verify which certificate your cluster is currently using, access the Couchbase Web Console, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, in the navigation-bar at the left-hand side:

[#access_security_tab]
image::pict/accessSecurityTab.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the [.ui]*Security* screen.
When it appears, left-click on the [.ui]*Root Certificate* tab, which is located on the horizontal control-bar, near the top (note that you must be in the role of _Full Administrator_, to see and access the Root Certificate):

[#access_root_certificate_tab]
image::pict/accessRootCertificateTab.png[,320,align=left]

This displays the [.ui]*Root Certificate View*, which features the self-signed root certificate, in a scrollable pane:

[#self_signed_cert_NewUI]
image::pict/self-signed-certNewUI.png[,620,align=left]

Note that the certificate can be regenerated or replaced, using the xref:rest-api:rest-encryption.adoc[Encryption On-the-Wire API], or xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-ssl-manage.adoc[CLI] commands for certificate-management.

[#handling-client-certificates]
== Handling Client Certificates

Couchbase Server supports authentication based on client-side certificates.
An example of client-side certificate-generation is provided in xref:security-x509certsintro.adoc#cert_auth_for_java_client[Provide Certificate-Based Authentication for a Java Client]; and an example of how such a certificate can be referenced by a client-program is provided in xref:java-sdk::sdk-authentication-overview.adoc#authenticating-a-java-client-by-certificate[Authenticating a Java Client by Certificate].

Clients' use of certificates can be _enabled_, _disabled_, or made _mandatory_ for the cluster; by means of the *Client Certificate* screen, which is accessible from the *Client Certificate* tab, near the top of the main *Security* screen of Couchbase Web Console.

[#require-client-certificate-panel]
image::pict/requireClientCertificatePanel.png[,620,align=left]

Select *Disable* to disable certificate-based authentication: this means that authorization can only occur by means of username and password (for Couchbase-defined users) or username (for LDAP-defined users).
Select *Enable* to make certificate-based authentication optional for clients.
Select *Mandatory* to make certificate-based authentication a requirement for clients (except in the case of manual login, at the Couchbase Web Console).

Appropriate _paths_, _prefixes_, and _delimiters_ can be specified: for detailed information on certificate-identity extraction, see xref:security-certs-auth.adoc[Certificate-Based Authentication].

[#disabling-non-secure-console-access]
== Disabling Non-Secure Console Access

If you wish to force Administrators to log into the UI over an encrypted channel, and so use port 18091, you can disable Couchbase Web Console access on port 8091.
This only affects console access, and does not prevent REST requests from continuing to use 8091, non-securely.

The following REST API method disables the Couchbase Web Console on port 8091:

----
curl -u Administrator:password http://localhost:8091/settings/security -d disableUIOverHttp=true
----

To re-enable Couchbase Web Console access on port 8091:

----
curl -u Administrator:password http://localhost:8091/settings/security -d disableUIOverHttp=false
----

The command line can also be used for this disabling step:

----
couchbase-cli setting-security -c <servername> -u Administrator \
   -p password --disable_ui_over_http
----

[#working-with-supported-protocols]
== Working with Supported Protocols

Couchbase Server client-libraries support client-side encryption, using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).
TLS versions 1.0 to 1.2 are supported by default.
The highest-supported version of TLS is recommended.
Optionally, you can set the minimum version of TLS to be 1.2 or higher, using the following command:

----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password http://127.0.0.1:8091/diag/eval -d "ns_config:set(ssl_minimum_protocol, 'tlsv1.2')"
----

This command should be executed per cluster; and requires Full Administrator privileges.

[#enabling-client-security]
== Securing Client-Application Access

For an application to communicate securely with Couchbase Server, SSL/TLS must be enabled on the client side.
To perform enablement, you must acquire a copy of the certificate used by Couchbase Server, and then follow the steps appropriate for your client.
Access the certificate from the Couchbase Web Console, as shown above.
Note that if, at some point, this certificate gets regenerated on the server-side, you must obtain a copy of the new version, and re-enable the client.

When a TLS connection is established between a client application and Couchbase Server running on port 18091, a _handshake_ occurs, as defined by the _TLS Handshake Protocol_.
As part of this exchange, the client must send to the server a _cipher-suite list_; which indicates the cipher-suites that the client supports, in order of preference.
The server replies with a notification of the cipher-suite it has duly selected from the list.
Additionally, symmetric keys to be used by client and server are selected by means of the _RSA key-exchange_ algorithm.

[#securing-sdk-access]
== Securing SDK Access

All the Couchbase SDKs support SSL/TLS encryption: Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, C, and Go.
Each must use the Couchbase network port `11207`, for secure communication.

[#securing-view-access]
== Securing View Access

Port `18092` must be used for secure view access.
Thus: `https://`_servername_`:18092`.

[#securing-query-access]
== Securing Query Access

The xref:n1ql:n1ql-rest-api/index.adoc[REST endpoint] for secure access to N1QL queries is: `https://`_servername_`:18093/query/service`.

[#securing-fts-access]
== Securing FTS Access

To use Full Text Search securely, port `18094` must be specified.
For example:

----
curl -u Administrator:password https://localhost:18094/api/index/myFirstIndex/count
----

[#securing-backups]
== Securing Backups

Both xref:cli:cbbackup-tool.adoc[cbbackup] and xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr.adoc[cbbackupmgr] can use the secure port: `https://`_servername_`:18091`.

[#overriding-supported-ciphers]
== Overriding Supported Ciphers

Couchbase Server uses ciphers that are accepted by default by OpenSSL.The default behavior employs _high_-security ciphers, built into OpenSSL.

You can override this selection, by setting the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment variable — this must be performed _before_ starting Couchbase Server.
The environment variable can be set in either of the following ways:

* Specify an explicit list of ciphers to be used.
For example:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="DHE-DSS-AES128-SHA,CAMELLIA128-SHA"
----

* Specify ciphers by security-level.
For example, to specify that all ciphers in both _medium_ and _high_ categories be used, enter the following:
+
----
COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST="MEDIUM,HIGH"
----

To display the ciphers available on your Linux platform for a particular security level, use the `openssl` command.
For example, to display the _high_-level ciphers, enter the following:

----
openssl ciphers -v 'HIGH'
----

To check the current value of the `COUCHBASE_SSL_CIPHER_LIST` environment variable, type `printenv` at the Linux prompt: this returns a list of all currently set environment variables.

[#moving-data-between-server-nodes]
== Moving Data Between Server-Nodes

Couchbase Server replicates data across a cluster, to ensure the data's high availability.
When you encrypt documents, replica copies are duly transmitted and stored in encrypted form.

For added security, use IPSec on the network that connects the Couchbase Server-nodes.
Note that IPSec has two modes: _tunnel_ and _transport_.
Transport mode is recommended, as it is the easier of the two to set up, and does not require the creation of tunnels between all pairs of Couchbase nodes.

To learn more about setting up transport mode IPSec for Couchbase, see the blog http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/june/configuration-ipsec-for-a-couchbase-cluster[Configuring IPsec for a Couchbase Cluster^].

[#moving-data-between-data-centers]
== Moving Data Between Data Centers

To protect data transmitted between data centers, you can use TLS to encrypt your XDCR connection.
When you enable TLS in XDCR, Couchbase Server uses TLS certificates.
TLS versions 1.0 to 1.2 are supported.
All traffic between source and destination-datacenters is encrypted.
Note that the encryption causes a slight increase in the CPU load.

You are recommended to rotate the XDCR certificates periodically, in accordance with your organization's security policy.

For information on securing XDCR, see xref:xdcr:xdcr-managing-security.adoc[XDCR Data Security].
