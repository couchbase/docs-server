= Roles

[abstract]
A Couchbase _role_ permits one or more _resources_ to be accessed according to defined _privileges_.

== Roles and Privileges

Couchbase _roles_ each have a fixed association with a set of one or more privileges.
Each privilege is associated with a resource.
Privileges are actions such as *Read*, *Write*, *Execute*, *Manage*, *Flush*, and *List*; or a combination of some or all of these.

Roles are of two kinds:

* _Administration and Global_: Associated with cluster-wide privileges.
Some of these roles are for administrators; who might manage cluster-configurations; or read statistics; or enforce security.
Others are for users and user-defined applications that require access to specific, cluster-wide resources.
* _Per Bucket_: Associated with one or more buckets.
These roles support the reading and writing of bucket-settings; the management of services, indexes, and replication procedures; and access to data.

When an administrator, user, or application attempts to access a resource, they must authenticate, by means of a username and password.
The roles and privileges associated with these credentials are checked by Couchbase Server.
If the associated roles contain privileges that support the kind of access that is being attempted, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied.

The following list contains all roles supported by Couchbase Server, _Enterprise Edition_.
Each role is explained by means of a description and (in most cases) a table: the table lists the privileges in association with resources.
The header of each table states the role's *name*, followed by its _alias name_ in parentheses: alias names are used in commands and queries.
In each table-body, where a privilege is associated with a resource, this is indicated with a check-mark.
Where a privilege is not associated with a resource (or where association would not be applicable), this is indicated with a cross.
Resources not referred to in a particular table have no privileges associated with them in the context of role being described.

Note that some roles grant access to Couchbase Web Console; while others do not.
The set of features displayed within the console varies, according to role.

Note also that any authentication failure will be logged in the log file for the resource on which access was attempted.
See xref:clustersetup:logging.adoc[Logging], for detailed information on using log files.

== Full Admin

The *Full Admin* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) supports full access to all Couchbase-Server features and resources, including those of security.
The role allows access to the Couchbase Web Console, and allows the reading and writing of bucket-data.

This role is also available in Couchbase Server _Community Edition_.

== Cluster Admin

The *Cluster Admin* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) allows the management of all cluster features except security.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console, but does not permit the writing of data.

== Security Admin

The *Security Admin* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) allows the management of user roles and the reading of all cluster statistics.
The role does not permit the granting of *Full Admin* or *Security Admin* roles, and does not permit the administrator to change their own role (which therefore remains *Security Admin*).
The role supports access to Couchbase Web Console, but does not support the reading of data.

== Read-Only Admin

The *Read-Only Admin* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) supports the reading of Couchbase clServer-statistics: this includes registered usernames with roles and authentication domains, but excludes passwords.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console.

This role is also available in Couchbase Server _Community Edition_.

== Query Curl Access

The *Query Curl Access* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) allows the N1QL CURL function to be executed by an externally authenticated user.
The user can access Couchbase Web Console, but cannot read data, other than that returned by the N1QL CURL function.

Note that the *Query Curl Access* role should be assigned with caution, since it entails risk: CURL runs within the local Couchbase Server network; therefore, the assignee of the *Query Curl Access* role is permitted to run GET and POST requests on the internal network, while being themselves externally located.

For an account of limitations on CURL, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/curl.adoc[CURL Function].

In versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.5, this role was referred to as *Query External Access*.

== Query System Catalog

The *Query System Catalog* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) allows information to be looked up by means of N1QL in the system catalog: this includes `system:indexes`, `system:prepareds`, and tables listing current and past queries.
This role is designed for troubleshooters, who need to debug queries.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console, but does not permit the reading of bucket-items.

== Analytics Reader

The *Analytics Reader* role (an _Administration and Global_ role) allows querying of shadow data-sets.
This is defined as a global role because as multiple buckets may be combined into a single shadow dataset.
The role allows access to Couchbase Web Console, and permits the reading of data.

== Application Access

The *Application Access* role provides read and write access to data, _per bucket_.
The role does not allow access to Couchbase Web Console: it is intended for applications, rather than users.
Note that this role is also available in the _Community Edition_ of Couchbase Server.

The role is provided in support of buckets that were created on versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.0.
Such buckets were accessed by specifying _bucket-name_ and _bucket-password_: however, bucket-passwords are not recognized by Couchbase Server 5.0 and after.
Therefore, for each pre-existing bucket, the upgrade-process for 5.0 and after creates a new user, whose username is identical to the bucket-name; and whose password is identical to the former bucket-password, if one existed.
If no bucket-password existed, the user is created with no password.
This migration-process allows the same name-combination as before to be used in authentication.
To ensure backwards compatibility, each system-created user is assigned the [.ui]*Application Access* role, which authorizes the same read-write access to bucket-data as was granted before 5.0.

Use of the [.ui]*Application Access* role is deprecated for buckets created on Couchbase Server 5.0 and after: use the other bucket-access roles provided.
Note that in versions of Couchbase Server prior to 5.5, this role was referred to as *Bucket Full Access*.
