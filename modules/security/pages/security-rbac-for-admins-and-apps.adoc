= Creating and Managing Users with the UI

[abstract]
Using the Couchbase Web Console, you can assign roles to users interactively.

== Full Administrator

The administrator who initially performs installation and configuration of Couchbase Server is granted the role of _Full Administrator_, with read-write access to the entire system.
Once basic system-configuration has been completed, the Full Administrator is free to add other users to the system, and assign them roles; thereby specifying their access-privileges.

== Adding Users

As Full Administrator, to add _users_ (each of which might be either an _administrator_ or an _application_) to Couchbase Server, use the Couchbase Web Console.
Access the [.ui]*Dashboard*, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, on the vertical navigation-bar, at the left.
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* view, as follows:

[#security_view]
image::pict/securityView.png[,820,align=left]

The [.ui]*Security* view allows users to be defined, and roles to be allocated to them.
It also allows management of the [.ui]*Root* and [.ui]*Client* certificates; of [.ui]*Audit*-processing; of [.ui]*Log Redaction*; and of [.ui]*Session* timeouts.
To add a user, left-click on the [.ui]*Add User* control, at the upper right.
The [.ui]*Add New User* dialog now appears:

[#manage_user_new]
image::pict/manageUserNew.png[,380,align=left]

The [.ui]*Authentication Domain* panel features two checkboxes: one specifying [.ui]*Couchbase*, the other [.ui]*External*.
By default, [.ui]*Couchbase* is checked: this means that the user will be defined locally, and that a user-password must therefore be created, using the [.ui]*Password* fields displayed on the dialog.
To define a user externally (for example, by accessing an LDAP server over the network), check the [.ui]*External* checkbox.
If you do so, no password need be specified, since one is assumed to have been defined elsewhere; and the [.ui]*Password* fields therefore disappear from the dialog.

Define a Couchbase user, by adding appropriate entries into the [.ui]*Username* and [.ui]*Password* fields.
The [.ui]*Full Name* field may be left blank.

For more information on defining users locally and externally, see xref:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

== Adding Roles

Roles can be specified by checking checkboxes in the [.ui]*Roles* panel:

[#add_new_user_dialog_roles_panel]
image::pict/addNewUserDialogRolesPanel.png[,280,align=left]

Roles are arranged in groups.
The first group, which appears at the top of the panel, is for *Administration & Global Roles*: this roles are either administrative, or involve access to cluster-wide features.
Subsequent groups appear below the first: each consists of roles that are applied _per bucket_.
By default, a single subsequent group is displayed, *All Buckets (*)*.
Each individual bucket on the cluster will be represented below *All Buckets (*)*, with its own hierarchy of roles.
This allows each individual user to be assigned roles either that apply to all buckets defined on the cluster, or to individual buckets.
Left-click on the corresponding right-pointing arrowhead to display a group's contents, scrolling down if necessary:

[#all_buckets_checkboxes]
image::pict/allBucketsCheckboxes.png[,280,align=left]

To display roles at lower levels of the *All Buckets (*)* hierarchy, left-click on the right-pointing arrowheads.

To assign roles to the user, simply check the appropriate checkboxes.
Then, left-click on the *Add User* button, at the lower right.

Note that some roles are considered to be _subsets_ of others.
In such cases, manually checking one checkbox may trigger the automated checking of others — indicating that the corresponding roles are also assigned to the user.
To demonstrate this, left-click on the [.ui]*Full Admin* checkbox, near the top.
The [.ui]*Roles* panel now appears as follows:

[#roles_panel_admin_checked]
image::pict/rolesPanelAdminChecked.png[,280,align=left]

As illustrated, selecting the [.ui]*Full Admin* role causes all other roles also to become selected: this is because [.ui]*Full Admin* stands at the top of the hierarchy, and is a superset of all other roles.

== Saving and Making Changes

Whenever you have finished allocating roles to a particular user, left-click on [.ui]*Add User*.
The dialog disappears, and the [.ui]*Security* view now displays, on the row of the corresponding [.ui]*username*, the roles you have allocated.
For example, if you have allocated [.ui]*Data Reader* and [.ui]*Data Writer* on [.ui]*travel-sample*, the view is as follows:

[#security_view_with_new_user]
image::pict/securityViewWithNewUser.png[,720,align=left]

Note that by left-clicking within the row, you display options for editing:

[#security_view_with_edit_options]
image::pict/securityViewWithEditOptions.png[,720,align=left]

By left-clicking on [.ui]*Delete*, you delete the user.
By left-clicking on [.ui]*Edit*, you bring up the [.ui]*Edit testUser* dialog, with the options to redefine username, full name, and roles (the content of this dialog is very similar to that of the [.ui]*Add New User* dialog, examined in detail above).
The btn:[Reset Password] button only appears when the selected user is _locally_ defined.
Left-clicking on the button brings up a dialog that allows redefinition of the user's password:

[#reset_password]

For a complete account of the roles you can allocate and their significance, see xref:security-roles.adoc[Roles].

== Role-Based Console Appearance

Role-assignment determines which features of Couchbase Web Console are available to the administrator.
Non-available features are not displayed: therefore, the console's appearance changes, based on which roles have been assigned to the current user.
