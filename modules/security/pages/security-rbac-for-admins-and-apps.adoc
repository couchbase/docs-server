[#topic_auth_for_admins]
= Creating and Managing Users with the UI

[abstract]
Using the Couchbase Web Console, you can assign roles to users interactively.

== Authorization for Full Administrators

The administrator who initially performs installation and configuration of Couchbase Server — the _Full Administrator_ — is granted read-write access to the entire system.
The user ID of this administrator can be either locally defined, or remotely; for example, by means of LDAP.

Once basic system-configuration has been completed, the Full Administrator is free to add additional administrators to the system, and assign them roles; thereby specifing their access-privileges.

== Adding Users

As Full Administrator, to add _users_ (each of which might be either an _administrator_ or an _application_) to Couchbase Server, use the Couchbase Web Console.
Access the [.uicontrol]*Dashboard*, and left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Security* tab, on the vertical navigation-bar, at the left.
This brings up the [.uicontrol]*Security* view, as follows:

[#security_view]
image::pict/securityView.png[,820,align=left]

The [.uicontrol]*Security* view allows users to be defined, and roles to be allocated to them.
It also allows management of the [.uicontrol]*Root Certificate*, and of [.uicontrol]*Audit*-processing.
To add a user, left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Add User* control, at the upper right.
The [.uicontrol]*Add New User* dialog now appears:

[#manage_user_new]
image::pict/manageUserNew.png[,300,align=left]

The [.uicontrol]*Authentication Domain* panel features two checkboxes: one specifying [.uicontrol]*Couchbase*, the other [.uicontrol]*External*.
By default, [.uicontrol]*Couchbase* is checked: this means that the user will be defined locally, and that a user-password must therefore be created, using the [.uicontrol]*Password* fields displayed on the dialog.
To define a user externally (for example, by accessing an LDAP server over the network), check the [.uicontrol]*External* checkbox.
If you do so, no password need be specified, since one is assumed to have been defined elsewhere; and the [.uicontrol]*Password* fields therefore disappear from the dialog.

Define a Couchbase user, by adding appropriate entries into the [.uicontrol]*Username* and [.uicontrol]*Password* fields.
The [.uicontrol]*Full Name* field may be left blank.

For more information on defining users locally and externally, see xref:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

== Adding Roles

To specify one or more roles, scroll down, and review the [.uicontrol]*Roles* panel:

[#add_new_user_dialog_roles_panel]
image::pict/addNewUserDialogRolesPanel.png[,300,align=left]

Each available role can be selected by means of a checkbox.
Roles are arranged in a hierarchy: by left-clicking on right-pointing arrowheads, you open a lower level of this hierarchy, and are able to inspect either additional roles, or additional levels, or both.
For example, left-click successively on the arrowheads for [.uicontrol]*Data Roles*, [.uicontrol]*Data Reader*, and [.uicontrol]*Data Writer*:

[#roles_panel_data_roles_open]
image::pict/rolesPanelDataRolesOpen.png[,300,align=left]

When opened, [.uicontrol]*Data Reader*, and [.uicontrol]*Data Writer* each reveal two checkboxes; which assign read and write permission respectively to [.uicontrol]*all* buckets, and to the `travel-sample` bucket alone.
To assign the user a specific role, check each appropriate checkbox, by left-clicking.
For example:

[#manage_user_new_with_multiple_roles]
image::pict/addNewuserSelectRoles.png[,300,align=left]

These role-assignments give the user read and write permission on the data in the `travel-sample` bucket.

Note that some roles are considered to be _subsets_ of others.
In such cases, manually checking one checkbox may trigger the automated checking of others — indicating that the corresponding roles are also assigned to the user.
To demonstrate this, left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Admin* checkbox.
The [.uicontrol]*Roles* panel now appears as follows:

[#roles_panel_admin_checked]
image::pict/rolesPanelAdminChecked.png[,320,align=left]

As illustrated, selecting the [.uicontrol]*Admin* role causes all other roles also to become selected: this is because [.uicontrol]*Admin* stands at the top of the hierarchy, and is a superset of all other roles.

== Saving and Making Changes

Whenever you have finished allocating roles to a particular user, left-click on [.uicontrol]*Save*.
The dialog disappears, and the [.uicontrol]*Security* view now displays, on the row of the corresponding [.uicontrol]*username*, the roles you have allocated.
For example, if you have allocated [.uicontrol]*Data Reader* and [.uicontrol]*Data Writer*, `[travel-sample]`, the view is as follows:

[#security_view_with_new_user]
image::pict/securityViewWithNewUser.png[,820,align=left]

Note that by left-clicking within the row, you display options for editing:

[#security_view_with_edit_options]
image::pict/securityViewWithEditOptions.png[,820,align=left]

By left-clicking on [.uicontrol]*Delete*, you delete the user.
By left-clicking on [.uicontrol]*Edit*, you bring up the [.uicontrol]*Edit testUser * dialog, with the options to redefine username, full name, and roles (the content of this dialog is very similar to that of the [.uicontrol]*Add New User* dialog, examined in detail above).
The btn:[Reset Password] button only appears when the selected user is _locally_ defined.
Left-clicking on the button brings up a dialog that allows redefinition of the user's password:

[#reset_password]
image::pict/resetPassword.png[,260,align=left]

For a complete account of the roles you can allocate and their significance, see xref:concepts-rba.adoc[RBAC for Administrators] and xref:concepts-rba-for-apps.adoc[RBAC for Applications].

== Role-Based Console Appearance

Role-assignment determines which features of Couchbase Web Console are available to the administrator.
Non-available features are not displayed: therefore, the console's appearance changes, based on which roles have been assigned to the current user.

This can be demonstrated with reference to the role _Cluster Admin_, which is assigned by means of the [.uicontrol]*Add New User* dialog.
Note once again that when the `Cluster Admin` checkbox is manually checked, the checkboxes for all other roles that are each considered a subset of _Cluster Admin_ are themselves automatically checked.

[#cluster_admin_role_selection]
image::pict/clusterAdminRoleSelection.png[,320,align=left]

When a user defined in this way logs into Couchbase Web Console, the console's appearance is as follows:

[#dashboard_initial_for_cluster_admin]
image::pict/dashboardInitialForClusterAdmin.png[,820,align=left]

Note that the [.uicontrol]*Security* option has been removed from the vertical navigation-bar, at the left; since the _Cluster Admin_ role is not privileged to read or write security-related data.

Other roles and role-combinations restrict feature-access in similar ways, and in consequence, produce different console-appearances for differently defined users.
