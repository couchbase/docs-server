= Audit Targets
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
The _target_ of a Couchbase Server audit is a JSON file; which is rotated after a configured time interval, and whose location path is configurable.
This section provides some examples of content-appearance.

== Audit Log Targets

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:security-auditing.adoc[Auditing].

== Login

An audit-record for a successful login might appear as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp":"2015-02-20T08:48:49.408-08:00",
  "id":8192,
  "name":"login success",
  "description":"Successful login to couchbase cluster",
  "role":"admin",
  "real_userid": {
    "source":"ns_server",
    "user":"bjones"
  },
 "sessionid":"0fd0b5305d1561ca2b10f9d795819b2e",
 "remote":{
  "ip":"172.23.107.165", "port":59383

}
----

In this example, a user named `bjones` has successfully logged into a Couchbase cluster using the domain IP address `172.23.107.165.`

== Login Failure
