= Audit Targets

[abstract]
The _target_ of a Couchbase Server audit is a JSON file; which is rotated after a configured time interval, and whose location path is configurable.
This section provides some examples of content-appearance.

== Audit Log Targets

When auditing is enabled, logged events are written to a default file, named `audit.log`.
After an administrator-specified period — which must be a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 7 days — this file is closed, and is saved under a modified name that features a timestamp corresponding to the time of saving.
A new, empty `audit.log` file is created and saved when a new audit event is generated.
Note that this _rotation_ may happen earlier if the file reaches its maximum size of 20MB.
For instructions on configuring the file's _rotation time_, see xref:security-auditing.adoc[Auditing].

== Login

An audit-record for a successful login might appear as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp":"2015-02-20T08:48:49.408-08:00", 
  "id":8192, 
   "name":"login success", 
   "description":"Successful login to couchbase cluster",                              
   "role":"admin", 
   "real_userid": {
      "source":"ns_server",
      "user":"bjones"
    },
   "sessionid":"0fd0b5305d1561ca2b10f9d795819b2e", 
   "remote":{"ip":"172.23.107.165", "port":59383}
