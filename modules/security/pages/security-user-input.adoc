= User Input Validation

[abstract]
User input should be validated by the client application, before the input is sent to Couchbase Server: this constitutes protection against malicious update, insertion, and erasure of data.

== Forms of Attack

The following forms of attack, based on the manipulation of user input, should be anticipated:

* Injecting arbitrary key-value pairs into an existing document.

* Changing the user-specified document-type from _private_ to _public_; and thereby increasing the possibility of illicit access.

* Overriding important document-fields.

For example, a malicious user might attempt to overwrite an existing password by generating the following JSON document:

----
{"user": "will","password":"0asd21$1%", "created":"2012-06-12", "password":"password"}
----

In this document, the first password-field contains `0asd21$1%`, which is the intended value.
Note however, that an additional `password` name-value pair has been concatenated onto the document-content.
Submission of this modified document would result in the plain `password` value overwriting the earlier specified, intended password.

== Forms of Protection

Malicious user-input is most effectively protected against by client applications that do not permit unconstrained document-configuration by users; and instead impose a more restrictive interface; whereby, for example, only specific values or name-value pairs are accepted, and are properly validated before dispatch.
(A document-model featuring Java POJOs or .NET POCOs might be used for such purposes.)
