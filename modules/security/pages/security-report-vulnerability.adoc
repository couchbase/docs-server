requests that you do _not_ publicly disclose any information regarding the vulnerability or exploit the issue until Couchbase had the opportunity to analyze the vulnerability, to respond to the notification, and to notify key users, customers, and partners.

The amount of time to validate and resolve a reported vulnerability depends on the complexity and severity of the issue, and whether there are any third party dependencies.
Couchbase takes all required vulnerabilities very seriously and will publicise confirmed security vulnerabilities in the announcement forum on the support knowledge base.
