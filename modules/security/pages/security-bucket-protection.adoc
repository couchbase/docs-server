= Bucket Protection

[abstract]
Couchbase Server secures buckets by means of _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC): thereby ensuring that for production-purposes, all buckets can be password-protected; with different access-privileges assigned to different users.

== Bucket Access

To access cluster-resources, Couchbase Server _users_ — administrators and applications — must specify a _username_ and _password_.
Each user, when defined by a _Full Administrator_ (who has full privileges on all cluster-resources), is assigned one or more _roles_; which determine either _read_ or _read-write_ access to server-resources.
When a user successfully authenticates, their roles are examined by Couchbase Server; if the assigned roles correspond to appropriate privileges, the user is granted due access to the resource.

Couchbase _buckets_ are among the resources protected by RBAC.
For more information on establishing users, credentials, roles, and buckets, see xref:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].

== Removal of Unprotected Buckets

For production-purposes, all buckets must be RBAC-protected, as described above.
Any additional, legacy buckets, created non-securely, should be removed: this applies to legacy _default_ and _sample_ buckets that were created without password-protection.
