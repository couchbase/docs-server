= Network ACLs and Security Groups

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security groups for the Amazon VPC.

For the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), security is provided with:

* Network Access Control Lists (ACLs), which are an optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet.
* Security groups, which act as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.

To ensure security:

* On the host level, you can set individual SSL keys using a bashing host.
Make sure that the access to your Couchbase instance is logged and audited through Amazonâ€™s logging capabilities.
* Obtain customer generated key pairs.
* Set up an outbound instance of a firewall in the VPC.
* To protect your access, sign your calls using a certificate or a customer key.
