= Network ACLs and Security Groups

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides _Network Access Control Lists_ (ACLs) and _Security Groups_, for the Amazon _Virtual Private Cloud_ (VPC).

== Ensuring Security

For the Amazon VPC, security is provided with:

* _Network Access Control Lists_ (ACLs), which constitute an optional layer of security; acting as a firewall for the controlling of traffic that passes in and out of a subnet.

* _Security Groups_, which act as a virtual firewall for your Couchbase Server-instance; controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

To ensure security:

* On the host level, set individual SSL-keys, using a bashing host.
Ensure that access to your Couchbase Server-instance is logged and audited, through Amazon’s logging capabilities.

* Obtain customer-generated key-pairs.

* Set up an outbound instance of a firewall, in the VPC.

* Sign your calls, using either a certificate or a customer key.
