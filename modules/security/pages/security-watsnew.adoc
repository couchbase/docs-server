= What's New

[abstract]
New security features in this release are: auditing for administrators and LDAP integration.

This release of Couchbase Server provides these new features:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for administrators::
RBAC was introduced to achieve segregation of duties for administrators so that each administrator can do only a well-defined fixed set of operations based on the job description.
See xref:concepts-rba.adoc[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Administrators].

X.509 Certificates for TLS::
With X.509 certificates, Couchbase Server can strongly encrypt client-server communications and XDCR (Cross Data Center Replication).
See xref:security-comm-encryption.adoc[Encryption on the Wire].
