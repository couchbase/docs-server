= What's New

[abstract]
This release includes the following new security-features: _Role-Based Access Control_ and _Authentication Domains_.

This release of Couchbase Server provides the following new features:

Role-Based Access Control::
Access privileges are assigned to fixed roles; which are in turn assigned to administrators and applications.
See xref:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].

Authentication Domains::
Couchbase Server assigns users to different _authentication domains_, based on whether their definition is _local_ (that is, on Couchbase Server itself) or _external_ (that is, by means of LDAP or PAM).
See xref:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication].
