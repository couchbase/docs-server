= Internal Roles

[abstract]
Couchbase Full Administrator can set up the internal role of the Read-Only Administrator.

Setting up of the Read-Only Administrator does not require that LDAP authentication is enabled.
Couchbase Full Administrator can create this role using the Couchbase Web Console and REST API.

== Read-Only Administrator

The Read-Only Administrator in Couchbase read-only access and cannot make any changes to the system, nor can it access N1QL.
The user can only view existing servers, buckets, views and monitor stats.

The Read-Only Administrator can do the following:

* Cluster Overview
* Design documents and view definitions but cannot query views.
* List of XDCR replications and remote clusters.
* Logged events under the Log tab but the user cannot Generate Diagnostic Report.
* Settings for a cluster.

The Read-Only Administrator cannot perform these tasks:

* Create or edit buckets
* Add nodes to clusters
* Change XDCR settings
* Create views or see any stored data.
* Any REST API calls which require administrator privileges will fail and return an error for this user.
+
The server sends an HTTP 401 error if an unauthorized user performs a REST POST or DELETE request that changes cluster, bucket, XDCR, or node settings:
+
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Couchbase Server Admin / REST"
       ....
----

* All SDKs require that a client connects with bucket-level credentials.
Therefore, the Read-Only Administrator cannot set up a Couchbase SDK to connect to the server.
