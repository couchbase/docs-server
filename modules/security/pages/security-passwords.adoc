= Couchbase Passwords

[abstract]
Use of passwords is an important security measure in Couchbase.

Couchbase Server supports several passwords:

* Administrative passwords for Couchbase administrators and LDAP administrators
* Bucket passwords to secure data access to each bucket

As a security best practice, choose passwords that are strong and periodically updated:

* Strong passwords should have at least seven (8) characters, consisting of letters (upper and lower case), digits, and special characters.
* Passwords should be rotated periodically based on organization's requirements.

You can reset any forgotten administrative passwords using the `reset_password` tool.
