= Couchbase Passwords

[abstract]
Use of passwords is an important security measure in Couchbase.

Couchbase Server supports several passwords:

* Administrative passwords for Couchbase administrators and LDAP administrators
* Bucket passwords to secure data access to each bucket

As a security best practice, choose passwords that are strong and periodically updated:

* To be strong, a password should have at least eight characters, including characters from three of the following five groups: lowercase letters; uppercase letters; numbers; symbols; unicode characters.
* Passwords should be rotated periodically, based on an organization's requirements.
* CRAM-MD5 is deprecated in Couchbase Server version 4.5.
Use SCRAM-SHA enabled SDKs instead.

You can reset any forgotten administrative passwords using the xref:cli:cbcli/reset-admin-password.adoc[couchbase-cli reset-admin-password] command.
