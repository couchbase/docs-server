[abstract]
Attaining a fully secure Couchbase Server network-environment requires the proper configuration of IP tables and ports; the use of _IPSec_; the establishment of firewalls; the limiting of access to critical files; and the secure maintenance of passwords.

== Establishing Firewalls and Protecting Files

The following measures are strongly recommended:

* Set up a firewall to block `epmd` port 4369 from access from outside the cluster-network.

* Set up a firewall to block `erlang` ports from access from outside the cluster-network.
These ports are configurable: in the default installation, their range is: 21100 to 21299.

* Restrict access to the following directories:
 ** On Linux: `/opt/couchbase`

 ** On Mac OS X: `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase`, and `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core`

 ** On Windows (assuming the default installation-location has been used): `C:\Program Files\Couchbase Server\`
* Ensure the confidentiality of passwords defined by the Full Administrator at cluster-initiallization; of all others used for the *Admin* and *Cluster Admin* roles; and of the _master password_.
See xref:secret-mgmt.adoc[Secret-Management] for details on how to define and use the master password.

== Securing the Network

To secure the network on which your Couchbase Server-cluster resides:

* Allow administrative access to Couchbase Server only through specific machines, such as _jump servers_.
To perform auditing on access-attempts made from these machines, turn on the OS-level auditing facility on each.

* Use IPSec on your local network.
For guidance, consult the following online information-resources:

 ** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hve3ZQJIdk[Configuring IPSec on Windows]
 ** http://www.infond.fr/2010/04/basics-9-tutorial-ipsec-transport-mode.html[Configuring IPSec on Linux]

== Controlling Access to Files

To restrict user-access to files and directories, traditional file-permissions can be used.
Additionally, RedHat Linux provides the following options:

* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/[Security Enhanced Linux^]
* https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch-acls.html[Access Control Lists^].

== Configuring IP Tables

SSH-access to Couchbase Server and access to the Couchbase Server administrative ports (8091 and 8092) can be restricted to specified machines.
Such restrictions can be established either at the network or at the system level, using _IP tables rules_.
Specifically, you can either:

* Execute the [.cmd]`iptables` command.
* Edit the file [.path]_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_:
+
----
##allow everyone to access port 80 and 443##
      -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
      -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
----

For more information, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-IPTables.html[IP tables rules^].
Additionally, a sample of IP tables rules can be found in http://blog.couchbase.com/iptables-firewall-settings-couchbase-db-and-couchbase-mobile-syncgateway[this blog^].

== Important Couchbase Server-Ports

The following table lists a subset of Couchbase Server ports, access to which may need to be controlled.
For a complete list of Couchbase Server ports, see xref:install:install-ports.adoc#topic2659[Network Configuration].

== Securing On-Disk Data

Critical data-locations should be protected by means of _transparent data encryption_ technologies; provided by 3rd party _on-disk encryption_ software-vendors, such as Vormetric.
For details, see xref:security-data-encryption.adoc[Encryption at Rest].
Also see the webinar provided at http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-resources/webinar/recorded[Understanding Database Encryption with Couchbase and Vormetric].
