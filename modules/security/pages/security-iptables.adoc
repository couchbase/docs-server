= IP Tables and Ports

[abstract]
Security outside Couchbase Server involves the configuration of IP tables and ports.

Security best practices include encrypting certain data locations using transparent data encryption technologies.
These technologies are offered by 3rd party on-disk encryption software vendors,  such as Vormetric.
To see more details, see the webinar provided at http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-resources/webinar/recorded[Understanding Database Encryption with Couchbase and Vormetric].

* Data and index file path (the default data path on Linux) at [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data_.
* Tools path at [.path]_/opt/couchbase/bin/_.
* Password files at [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/isasl.pw_ and [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/config/_.

For additional security:

* Allow administrative access to Couchbase Server only through specific machines, e.g., jump servers.
To audit access, turn on OS level auditing on these machines.
* Use IPSec on your local network.

Here are some of the good online sources about IPSec and its configuration:

== Configuring IP Tables and Ports

To configure IP tables for Linux, you have to edit the file located in [.path]_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_ as follows:

----
##allow everyone to access port 80 and 443##
   -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
   -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
----

Keep in mind that certain Couchbase ports are used for node-to-node and some for node-to-client communication.

For a complete list of Couchbase ports, see xref:install:install-ports.adoc#topic2659[Network Configuration].
