= Access Logs

[abstract]
Access logs are used to monitor the administrator's access to the Couchbase cluster.

The Couchbase access logs:

* Track REST or the Couchbase Web Console's accesses and can be found in the file [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/http_access.log_.
* Are ASCII text based, which is a common log format.
* Allow you to retrieve the following information:
 ** Client IP patterns
 ** Error codes, such as `401`
 ** Suspicious URLs

You can use an access log along with OS auditing on your server.

While the OS log shows who logged in, the access log shows whether an administrator who logged is connected to the Couchbase Server or failed to connect.
