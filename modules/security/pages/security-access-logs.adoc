= Access Logs

[abstract]
_Access logs_ are used to monitor access to Couchbase Server.

== Location and Purpose of Access Logs

Couchbase Server maintains two access logs: which are `http_access.log` and `http_access_internal.log`.
These are located in `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs/`.

Both record server access-attempts: `http_access_internal.log` recording those made by server-internal components.
Each individual access-record features a timestamp; and may include the IP-address of the caller, whether the request was GET or POST, and the HTTP status-code resulting from the request.

Both logs are ASCII-text based.
Both should be consulted regularly; so that access-patterns can be reviewed.
In particular, `http_access.log` can be used to identify repeated access-failures and external IP-addresses that are suspicious.
