= Authentication

[abstract]
To access Couchbase Server, administrators and applications must be authenticated.
_Authentication_ is a process for identifying a user who is attempting to access a system.

== Passing Credentials

Couchbase-Server authentication relies on _credentials_, which must be passed into the system by the user who is attempting access.
Credentials can be entered manually, or passed into the system by an application.
The credentials passed must match ones already stored and accessible by the system: if a match is achieved, the user is thereby recognized, and so _may_ be granted access.
If no match is achieved, the user is denied access.

To access Couchbase Server, administrators authenticate by means of a username and password.
These credentials can be validated by Couchbase Server itself: alternatively if the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server for Linux is used, validation can be performed either  on a network-accessible directory-server, by means of the _Lightweight Directory Access Protocol_ (LDAP); or by means of the _Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) authentication-framework.

== Authentication Domains

Couchbase Server assigns users to different _authentication domains_:

* _Local_: Contains users defined locally.
This includes:

 ** The _Full Administrator_ for Couchbase Server.

 ** _Internal Components_ within Couchbase Server that support core functionality (for example, indexing, searching, and replicating), and run with full administrative privileges.

 ** _Generated Users_, which are created by Couchbase Server as part of the upgrade process from pre-5.0 to 5.0 and post-5.0 versions; each in correspondence with a legacy bucket.
Each Generated User is assigned a _username_ that is identical to the bucket-name; and either a _password_ that is identical to the bucket's pre-5.0 password, or _no password_, if the bucket did not feature a password.
Generated Users are created to ensure that legacy applications can continue to access legacy buckets after upgrade to 5.0 or post-5.0, with the same username-password combination being used for authentication.

 ** _Locally Defined Users_, which are explicitly created by a Couchbase Server administrator; and each feature a username and password unique within the Local domain.

* _External_: Contains users defined externally; either by means of _LDAP_ or _PAM_.
Passwords are defined and stored remotely.
Note that External usernames do not clash with Local usernames.

When a user attempts to authenticate, Couchbase Server always looks up their credentials in the same order: which is _Local_ first, and _External_ second.
