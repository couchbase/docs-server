= Authorization
:page-aliases: security-authorization

[abstract]
Authorization is the mechanism by which a system determines what level of access a particular authenticated user, administrator or application,  can have to secured resources controlled by the system.

Secured resources on which the authenticated Couchbase administrators are allowed to perform pre-defined actions, or to view and modify information, are Couchbase clusters, Couchbase buckets, views, and replication.

Applications in Couchbase can access Couchbase buckets and use bucket passwords to authenticate.
