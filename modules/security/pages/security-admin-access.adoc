= Secure administrative access
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Encrypted administrative access enables HTTPS access for the Couchbase Web Console and the REST API using SSL/TLS.

Couchbase Server client libraries support client-side encryption using the SSL/TLS protocol by encrypting data in-flight between the client and the server.
This encryption establishes a secure channel between the remote machine and the server.

Couchbase Server generates a self-signed certificate for the initial node, which is propagated throughout the server nodes in the cluster.
If the self-signed certificate is regenerated or updated, it must be obtained again before secure server communication is re-established.
The secure connection is on the cluster level rather than on the bucket level.
It is established through the dedicated HTTPS REST port `18091` or the HTTPS CAPI port `18092`.

In case you want to force an SSL connection to the Couchbase cluster, you have to lock the non-SSL ports.

== Connecting to the Couchbase Web Console

While an administrative console is typically protected via an HTTPS connection, the new administrative access on port `18091` allows connection to the Couchbase Web Console over SSL/TLS, which is enabled by default.

To talk over SSL/TLS to the Couchbase Web Console, connect to the following URL with your web browser: [.in]`+https://couchbase_server:18091+`

Select menu:Settings[Cluster].

The [.ui]*Cluster* tab shows that a self-signed certificate has been deployed across the cluster.
This certificate can be regenerated or replaced.

== Configuring a secure administrative access to the web browser

. Connect to Couchbase Server through an encrypted port to communicate on a secure channel (`18091` for REST HTTP or `18092` for CAPI HTTP).
. Log in with the administrator's name and password.
. Once you are logged in, the URL shows a secure connection.

The following is an example URL of a secure connection using the Safari web browser:

== Using REST for encrypted access

GET filepath [.path]_/pools/default/certificate_ REST API HTTP method and URI retrieves the self-signed certificate from the cluster.

The following shows REST syntax with [.cmd]`curl` for retrieving the certificate:

----
curl -X GET  -u adminName:adminPassword
    http://localHost:Port/pools/default/certificate > ./<certificate_name>
----

The following examples use [.cmd]`curl` and [.cmd]`wget` to retrieve the certificate

----
curl http://10.5.2.54:8091/pools/default/certificate > clusterCertificate
----

----
wget http://10.5.2.54:8091/pools/default/certificate -O clusterCertificate
----

The following examples use [.cmd]`curl` and [.cmd]`wget` with the certificate to retrieve cluster information over an encrypted connection.
The port used is the encrypted REST port `18091`.

----
curl --cacert clusterCertificate https://10.5.2.54:18091/pools/default
----

----
wget --ca-certificate clusterCertificate  https://10.5.2.54:18091/pools/default -O output
