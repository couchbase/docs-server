= LDAP-Based Authentication

[abstract]
Couchbase administrators can be set up to authenticate by means of LDAP.
This requires that each administrator be added as a user on an LDAP server, and their LDAP credentials mapped to Couchbase Server.
Additionally, it requires that the `saslauthd` library, which handles authentication-requests on behalf of Couchbase Server, be configured to handle LDAP authentication.

== Restrictions

LDAP authentication is currently available only for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, and only on the Linux platform.

Note also that mixed-version clusters do not support LDAP authentication: therefore, to use LDAP authentication with a given cluster, upgrade all cluster-nodes to the latest version of Enterprise Edition Couchbase Server.

Couchbase Server is designed to interoperate with _OpenLDAP_ software, which can be downloaded from the http://www.openldap.org/[openldap.org^] website.

== Benefits

Authenticating Couchbase Server-administrators with LDAP provides the benefits of:

* _Centralized identity management_.
Multiple administrators can be defined, each with either _read-only_ or full, _read-write_ permissions.

* _Centralized security policy-management_.
All administrative accounts can be consistently protected: for example, through the enforcement of password strength-levels, password-rotation, and auto-lockout.

* _Simplified compliance_.
The activities of each administrator can be identified, tracked, and comprehensively audited.

== Architecture

The LDAP authentication-architecture used by Couchbase Server is as follows:

As the illustration shows, the administrator enters a username and password at the login prompt provided by Couchbase Web Console.
This is checked against a local _admin password file_.
If the `saslauthd` library has been configured for LDAP, the credentials are then checked against an LDAP directory service: if the credentials are validated, authentication succeeds.

For details on configuring the `saslauthd` library, see xref:security-saslauthd-new.adoc[Setting up `saslauthd`].
