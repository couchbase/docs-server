= Audit Events
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending corresponding output to target files.

== Event Tables

The events listed in the following tables support the auditing of administrative and data changes, made on the cluster. Each table corresponds to a module.

In each table, the first column (at the left) features the event-group heading (thereby repeating the tableâ€™s title, so as to ensure readability throughout the longer tables). The second column provides the event name. The third column provides the id for the event. The fourth column provides a description of the event; the fifth describes whether it is _filterable_ (see xref:security:security-auditing.adoc#filterable-events[Filterable Events]); and the sixth indicates whether the event is classified as Data or Admin.

=== REST API Events

The following events are generated by Couchbase Server in response to calls made with the REST API.
