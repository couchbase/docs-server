= Audit Events

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides rich administrative auditing for over 25 administrative events and captures them in output target files.

Couchbase Server captures administrative events such as successful and failed logins, events associated with cluster and bucket configuration and with the use of tools that require administrative privileges.
These auditable events are captured in the output targets, which are files in JSON format.
