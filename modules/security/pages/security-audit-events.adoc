= Audit Events
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Couchbase Server provides event-auditing, sending corresponding output to target files.

== List of Audit Events

Events audited by Couchbase Server include successful and failed logins, events associated with cluster and bucket configuration, and the use of tools that require administrative privileges.
Corresponding information is captured in _output targets_, which are files in JSON format.

Couchbase Server generates audit events whenever the following actions occur:
