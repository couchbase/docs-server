= Security Best Practices

[abstract]
Best practices should be observed at all times, in order to ensure the security of Couchbase Server itself, the media it uses for data-persistence, the internal and external networks on which it resides, and the applications that query it.

== Securing Couchbase Server

Security must be enforced — in order to protect data from being stolen, eavesdropped upon, or corrupted — throughout the entire Couchbase Server-environment: this environment includes the internal memory, processing, and storage-facilities of individual server-nodes within a cluster; the network across which the nodes communicate with one another; and the network beyond the cluster-perimeter.
Security procedures must be checked constantly; and should be upgraded with frequency.

== Within the Cluster

On each node of the Couchbase Server-cluster, essential security measures include:

* xref:security-passwords.adoc[Password enforcement]
* xref:security-bucket-protection.adoc[Bucket authentication and protection]
* xref:security-admin-access.adoc[Securing administrative access]
* xref:security-encryption.adoc[Performing encryption]
* xref:security-access-logs.adoc[Maintaining access-logs]

All are described in detail, in this section.

== Beyond the Cluster

Security must be maintained:

* Across the network, by proper configuration of xref:security-iptables.adoc[IP tables and ports.]

* Within individual applications, by appropriate use of the xref:security-config-cache.adoc[client configuration cache], and by performing xref:security-user-input.adoc[user input validation].

* In the cloud, through appropriate configuration of xref:security-acls-new.adoc[Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) and security groups], as well as xref:xdcr:xdcr-intro.adoc#topic1500[Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR)].
