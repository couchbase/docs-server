= Auditing for Administrators

[abstract]
Only the Full Administrators can configure auditing.

Auditing function is a security control necessary to comply with regulatory standards.

Audit records capture Who does What, When, and How

* *Who* refers to administrators performing an action.
The Couchbase administrators authenticate using their account username, and the LDAP administrators authenticate using the LDAP user ID.
* *What* refers to the administrative action being performed.
* *When* refers to the UTC time stamp that corresponds to the action that has occurred.
* *How* refers to the state of the event.
In this case, it can be a success or a failure.

Only Couchbase processes can write audit records, which are asynchronous by default and stored as JSON files.

== Configuring Auditing with UI

Only the full Couchbase administrators can configure auditing using the Couchbase Web Console.

          setting-audit  OPTIONS
          --audit-log-rotate-interval=[MINUTES]     //log rotation interval
          --audit-log-path=[PATH]                   //target log directory
          --audit-enabled=[0|1]                     //enable auditing or not
----
