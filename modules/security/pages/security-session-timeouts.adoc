== Specifying Session Timeouts

To ensure security, inactive browser-sessions should be closed.
The maximum inactivity-period is configurable, by means of Couchbase Web Console.

Access the *Security* panel, by means of the *Security* tab, at the left-hand side of the console.
Then, left-click on the *Session* tab, at the upper-right:

[#sessionTimeOutTab]

The *Session* panel is displayed, as follows:

[#sessionScreen]

Enter an appropriate number of minutes into the interactive field.
All inactive browser-sessions will be closed after this period.
