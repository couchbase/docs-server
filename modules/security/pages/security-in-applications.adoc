= Encryption in Applications

[abstract]
You can encrypt data _inside your application_, even before it is sent to the server.
This allows encryption to be used selectively, for only the most sensitive information you intend to send.

== Best Practices

You are strongly recommended:

* Always to maintain the secrecy of your _encryption key_: by means of either a _secure key ring_, or a _hardware security module_ (HSM).

* Always to use a _standard encryption library_ to encrypt data; and never to rely on in-house encryption or key-management solutions.

* Never, when managing documents, to include sensitive information in the document ID.
