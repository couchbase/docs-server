= PAM-Based Authentication

[abstract]
_Pluggable Authentication Modules_ (PAM) provide an authentication framework that allows multiple, low-level authentication schemes to be used by a single API.
The _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, running on Linux, supports administrator-authentication through PAM's _Linux password-module_.

== PAM Features

Used with the _Enterprise Edition_ of Couchbase Server, the PAM _Linux password-module_ provides:

* _External authentication_: Administrator-accounts defined on Linux systems, in the `/etc/shadow` directory, can be accessed for authentication-purposes by Couchbase Server.

* _Password policy-management_: Linux password-management can be used across different Couchbase Server-nodes; to synchronize, maintain, and expire administrator-passwords.

== Version Requirements

Use of the PAM Linux password-module requires all cluster-nodes to be Linux-based, running the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server, version 4.6 or above.
Additionally, the `saslauthd` library version must be 2.1.x or above.

== Example: Linux Password-Authentication

The following sequence shows how the PAM Linux password-module can be used with Couchbase Server 5.0 and above, to validate usernames and passwords, when administrators log into Couchbase Server.
Supervisor access, via `sudo`, is required to perform most of the steps; and an editor is required, to allow you to edit configuration files.

IMPORTANT: For PAM to be fully configured, the following procedure must be performed on each node in the cluster.

Proceed as follows:

. Bring up a terminal, and install the `saslauthd` library for your Linux distribution:
+
*Centos/RHEL*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ yum install cyrus-sasl
----
+
*Ubuntu/Debian*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get install sasl2-bin
----

. Ensure that the Couchbase Cluster is running.
Then, enable external authentication on the cluster, using the Couchbase CLI `setting-ldap` command: specifying server IP-address and port number, username and password:
+
[source,bash]
----
 $ couchbase-cli setting-ldap -c 10.142.170.101:8091 -u Administrator -p U&y54wT --ldap-enabled 1
----
+
Note that `--ldap-enabled 1` enables external authentication, and `--ldap-enabled 0` disables.
See xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-ldap.adoc[setting-ldap] for further information.
When successfully executed, the command provides the following notification: `SUCCESS: LDAP settings modified`.

. Add the `couchbase` user to the `sasl` group, to allow access to `saslauthd`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ usermod -aG sasl couchbase
----

. In the `saslauthd` configuration file, verify that `saslauthd` is set up to use PAM, by using the `grep` command, and examining the output:
+
*Centos/RHEL*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ grep "MECH" /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd
MECH=pam
----
+
If output to the above command does not confirm that `MECH` is set to `pam`, bring up the configuration file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and manually set the `MECH` parameter to `pam`.
+
*Ubuntu/Debian*
+
[source,bash]
----
$ grep 'MECHANISMS' /etc/default/saslauthd
MECHANISMS="pam"
----
+
If output to the above command does not confirm that `MECHANISMS` is set to `pam`, bring up the configuration file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, and manually set the `MECHANISMS` parameter to `pam`.

. Set up PAM to authenticate the Couchbase service, by copying `/etc/pam.d/passwd` to `/etc/pam.d/couchbase`.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cp /etc/pam.d/passwd /etc/pam.d/couchbase
----

. Create a Linux user on the current system, and give them a password.
For example, username [.in]`don`, and password [.in]`secretpa$$`.
(This user is the administrator who will be authenticated by PAM.)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ useradd don
$ passwd secretpa$$
Enter new UNIX password:
----
+
Enter and then verify your chosen password, as prompted.

. Access Couchbase Web Console, at `localhost:8091`, and log in.
Then, access the [.ui]*Security* tab, situated on the upper, horizontal control-bar.
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* view:
+
[#security_view_initial]
image::pict/securityViewInitial.png[,820]

. Left-click on the btn:[Add User] button, situated near the right.
This brings up the [.ui]*Add New User* dialog.
Select the [.ui]*External* radio-button, in the [.ui]*Authentication Domain* panel at the upper left.
Then, enter the name of the new user you are creating, and specify a suitable role, such as [.ui]*Cluster Admin*.
The panel appears as follows:
+
[#manage_user_new_subsequent2]
image::pict/manageUserNewSubsequent2.png[,310]
+
Then, left-click on [.ui]*Save*.
The newly defined user now appears in the [.ui]*Security* view.

. In the terminal, restart the SASL service, to allow PAM authentication to take effect.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service saslauthd restart
----
+
*Note*: When this command is successful, the output confirms that the daemon has been started.
If the command fails, and the output includes a line such as `To enable saslauthd, edit /etc/default/saslauthd and set START=yes`, bring up the file `/etc/default/saslauthd` in an editor, locate the line that reads `START=no`, and change it to `START=yes`.
Then, save the file, exit, and rerun the command.

. Restart the Couchbase service, to allow external authentication through PAM to take effect.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service couchbase-server restart
----

. In the browser, access `localhost:8091`.
When the Couchbase Web Console login-interface appears, enter the username and password you previously created:
+
[#couchbase_login]
image::pict/couchbaseLogin.png[,360]
+
Left-click on the btn:[Sign In] button.
The user you created is now logged into Couchbase Server, as an administrator.
