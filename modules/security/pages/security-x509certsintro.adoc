= X.509 for TLS

[abstract]
Couchbase Server uses X.509 certificates to encrypt client-server communications and XDCR (Cross Data Center Replication).

Couchbase Server 4.5 Enterprise Edition supports X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS).

With X.509 certificates, Couchbase Server can strongly encrypt client-server communications and http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/xdcr/xdcr-intro.html[XDCR^] (Cross Data Center Replication).

NOTE: Full administrators in Couchbase can manage certificates using the Couchbase CLI tools (as described in xref:cli:cbcli/ssl-manage.adoc[[.cmd]`ssl-manage`]) or REST API (as described in xref:rest-api:rest-security.adoc[Security API]).

With CA-based certificates, you also achieve their simplified management and rotation without client downtime.

NOTE: Your prior knowledge of TLS/SSL, PKI certificates including X.509 certificates, and Certificate Authorities (CAs) is assumed for this overview.

*When to use X.509 Certificates*

An X.509 certificate does more than just distribute the public key: it is signed by a trusted (internal or third-party) CA and verifies the identity of the server so that clients know their information is not being sent to a rogue server.

Some common scenarios which may require use of X.509 certificates are:

* In production where clients have to go through the internet.
* When transferring sensitive data on the wire between application and Couchbase Server, or between data centers (XDCR).
* When mandated by regulatory compliance regulations.

*CA Hierarchies Supported by Couchbase*

Couchbase customers can tie Couchbase Server with their CA hierarchies.
The CA at the top of a hierarchy is called the root authority, or root CA.
There are two types of CA hierarchies supported by Couchbase: single- or n-tier.

Single-Tier Hierarchy::
In its simplest form, the single-tier hierarchy starts with a root CA.
+
image::pict/ca_single_tier.png[,align=left]
+
For example, as shown in the figure above, the root CA is also the issuing CA.
All certificates immediately below the root certificate inherit its trustworthiness and can be used to secure systems.
+
Although this is the simplest form of CA hierarchy, most enterprises use an N-tier CA hierarchy as described next.

N-Tier Hierarchy::
Typically, in many production deployments, a hierarchy will have multiple CAs.
+
image::pict/ca_n_tier.png[,570,align=left]
+
In a multi-tier hierarchy, the root CA issues certificates to the intermediate CAs, which in turn generate intermediate certificates used to sign the client certificates such as a cluster certificate:

* Trusted root CA > Intermediate CA > Cluster certificate
* Trusted root CA > Intermediate CA 1 > Intermediate CA 2\.... > Intermediate CA N > Cluster certificate

+
When you need to regenerate the intermediate certificate, ensure that the chain can be verified up to the root CA.
+
If all intermediate certificates are not installed on your server, some clients might think you are on an insecure connection.
This results in 'untrusted' warnings like the following:
+
image::pict/back-to-safety.png[,450,align=left]
+
To avoid such warnings, a server should always send a complete trust chain.
The trust chain contains your certificate concatenated with all intermediate certificates.

[[configuring-x.509]]
== Configuring X.509

This section explains how to configure X.509 certificates for TLS in Couchbase Server.

NOTE: Choosing a root CA, the CA hierarchy, and obtaining a certificate from that CA chain to set up a Couchbase cluster are not within the scope of this document.

*X.509 Certificate Requirements and Best Practices*

Here are the basic requirements for using your X.509 certificates in Couchbase:

* The certificate must be in available in the `.pem` format.
* The certificate must be an RSA key certificate.
* The current system time must fall between the times set in the certificate's properties `valid from` and `valid to`.
* Common name: This can be a certificate with a `nodename` (preferable), IP address, URI (`www.example.com`), or URI with a subject alternative name (SAN) certificate (`example.com` and `example.net`).
* The node certificate must be designated for server authentication set in the optional field of the certificate's property `enhanced key usage` as `Server Authentication`.

Here are a few best practices around X.509 certificates in Couchbase that you should consider using:

* To avoid man-in-the-middle attacks do not use wildcards with IP addresses in the certificate common name.
* We recommended at least RSA key-length of 2048 bits or higher.
As computing capabilities increase, longer RSA keys provide increased security.

The certificate chain must be valid from the node certificate up to the root certificate, which can be verified using the https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/verify.html[OpenSSL validate certificate test^].

*Validating Server Identity*

The HTTPS specification mandates that HTTPS clients must be capable of verifying the identity of the server.
This requirement can potentially affect how you generate your X.509 certificates.
The HTTPS specification defines a generic mechanism for verifying the server identity, known as the HTTPS URL integrity check, which is the standard mechanism used by Web browsers.

*HTTPS URL integrity check*

The basic idea of the URL integrity check is that the server certificate's identity must match the server hostname.
This integrity check has an important impact on how you generate X.509 certificates for HTTPS: the certificate identity (usually the certificate subject DNâ€™s common name) must match the name of the host on which Couchbase Server is deployed.

The URL integrity check is designed to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Specify the certificate identity for the URL integrity check in one of the following ways:

Using the `commonName`:: The usual way to specify the certificate identity (for the purpose of the URL integrity check) is through the Common Name (CN) in the subject DN of the certificate.

Using the `subjectAltName`::
If you deploy a certificate on a multi-homed host, however, you might find it is practical to allow the certificate to be used with any of the multi-homed host names.
In this case, it is necessary to define a certificate with multiple, alternative identities, and this is only possible using the `subjectAltName` certificate extension.

The HTTPS protocol also supports in host names the wildcard character *.
For example, you can define the `subjectAltName` as follows:

----
subjectAltName=DNS:*.couchbase.com
----

This certificate identity matches any three-component host name in the domain `couchbase.com`.

NOTE: As a best practice, try to avoid using the wildcard character in the domain name.
Be sure never to do this accidentally by forgetting to type the dot (.) delimiter in front of the domain name.
For example, if you specified *couchbase.com, your certificate could be used in any domain that ends with the string `couchbase`.

*Couchbase Cluster Certificate*

The Couchbase cluster certificate is the root CA's public key `ca.pem`.
In the configuration steps shown in the following sections, `ca.pem` is the CA public key that should be configured in Couchbase as the cluster certificate.

When you load the cluster certificate into Couchbase, it is first checked to make sure it is a valid X.509 certificate.
Next, if the per-node certificates are not signed by the cluster certificate, a warning is shown for each node during configuration.
As the per-node certificates are updated, such that they are signed by the cluster certificate, the warning for each node goes away.

*Per Node Certificate*

The Couchbase cluster certificate is used to sign per-node Couchbase certificates, each containing the following:

* The node private key, which is named `pkey.key` as shown in the configuration steps below.
* The node public key certificate file, which is named `pkey.pem` as shown in the configuration steps below.
* The certificate chain file based on the supported CA hierarchy, This file is named `chain.pem` as shown in the configuration steps below.

.Private and public keys you need to have
[cols="100,143,334"]
|===
| | Key name | Description

.5+| Server-side files
| `ca.pem`
| Root CA public key or the cluster certificate.

| `int.pem`
| Intermediate public key.
There can be one or more intermediate public keys in the hierarchy.

| `pkey.key`
| Node private key per node (private key of the node).
Each node in the cluster must have its private key.

| `pkey.pem`
| Node public key (public key of the node).
Each node in the cluster must have its public key.

| `chain.pem`
| Concatenated chain file (chain file).
This file contains the node public key and the intermediate public keys that signed first the node key (pkey.pem) and then each other.

This file does not contain the CA public key.

.2+| Client-side files
| `ca.pem`
| CA public key, which should be configured on the client

| `chain.pem`
| Concatenated chain file (chain file)
|===

*Prepare for Configuration*

NOTE: If your CA authority supports automatic generation of certificates, you can skip the X.509 configuration steps.

Before you start configuring X.509 certificates for your nodes, assess your needs.

Where will you put the configured CA, intermediate, and node keys?::
All the keys and certificates are generated in a directory named SSLCA, which can be located anywhere on your machine.
+
The generated private node key (`pkey.key`) and chain certificate (`chain.pem`) must be posted in a specific place that is in the certificate trust path (such as [.path]_/Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/_ on MacOSX).

Do you have one or more nodes in the cluster?::
* With one node, you will generate one node directory inside the directory SSLCA that will contain the private node key (`pkey.key`) and the certificate chain file (`chain.pem`).
The node public key (`pkey.pem`) is included in the chain file.
* With multiple nodes, you need to add an appropriate number of node directories with distinctive names, such as `node-sales`, `node-hr,` or whatever your situation requires.

Do you have one or more intermediate CAs in your trust path?::
With only one CA, create one directory named `int`.
If you have multiple intermediate CAs, be sure to name them in a way that will allow you to stack them properly in the chain file, such as `int1`, `int2`, and so on.
+
This order will show that the intermediate CA closest to the node (which signed the node certificate) has the higher number, or in the sample below `int2`.

[#sslconfig]
== Configure X.509 Certificates using openSSL

Here are the steps to help you generate X.509 certificates:

. Create a top-level directory called SSLCA in your user folder and three types of sub-directories:
 ** One subdirectory called `root`
 ** One or more `int` subdirectories
 ** One or more `node` subdirectories
. Generate the root private key file (`ca.key`), and CA public key file (`ca.pem`).
+
Enter the following command inside the `root` subdirectory:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
----
+
----
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
............................................................................................+++
....+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
----
+
----
openssl req -new -x509  -days 3650 -sha256 -key ca.key -out ca.pem \
-subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Root CA'
----

. Generate the intermediate private key file (`int.key)` and the intermediate certificate signing request (`int.csr`) to generate the intermediate public key file (`int.pem`).
+
Enter the following command inside the `int` subdirectory:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out int.key 2048
----
+
----
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
..........................................+++
.....+++
e is 65537 (0x10001
----
+
----
openssl req -new -key int.key -out int.csr -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Intermediate CA'
----

. Create the extension file (`v3_ca.ext)` to add extensions to the certificate and to generate the certificate signing request.
+
In the `int` subdirectory enter:
+
----
cat <<EOF >> v3_ca.ext
----
+
Then add the following:
+
----
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer:always
basicConstraints = CA:true
EOF
----
+
Your `int` directory now contains three files: `int.csr`,  `int.key`, and `v3_ca.ext`.

. Generate the intermediate public key file (`int.pem)` based on the intermediate certificate signing request (`int.csr`), and signed by the root public key (`ca.pem`):
 .. In the `int` subdirectory enter:
+
----
openssl x509 -req -in int.csr -CA ../root/ca.pem -CAkey ../root/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
-CAserial rootCA.srl -extfile v3_ca.ext -out int.pem -days 365
----
+
The response will be similar to the following:
+
----
Signature ok
subject=/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Intermediate CA
Getting CA Private Key
----

 .. Verify that `openssl` has correctly signed the intermediate certificate with the root certificate:
+
----
openssl verify -CAfile ../root/ca.pem int.pem
----
+
The response will be:
+
----
int.pem: OK
openssl x509 -in int.pem -text
----
. Generate the node private key file (`pkey.key`) and the node certificate signing request (`pkey.csr`) to generate the node public key file (`pkey.pem`).
+
Be sure to enter another node and use the appropriate node name instead of the variable *<node-name>*, such as "sales" or "HRâ€™.
Each time you use another name, another set of files will be generated.

 .. Inside the node subdirectory (repeated for each node in the cluster):
+
----
openssl genrsa -out pkey.key 2048
openssl req -new -key pkey.key -out pkey.csr -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=<node-name>'
openssl x509 -req -in pkey.csr -CA ../int/int.pem -CAkey ../int/int.key -CAcreateserial \
-CAserial intermediateCA.srl -out pkey.pem -days 365
----
+
For example, for the `node-sales` directory:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out pkey.key 2048
openssl req -new -key pkey.key -out pkey.csr -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=sales'
openssl x509 -req -in pkey.csr -CA ../int/int.pem -CAkey ../int/int.key -CAcreateserial \
-CAserial intermediateCA.srl -out pkey.pem -days 365
----
+
The response for the `node-sales` directory should be as follows:
+
----
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:node-sales john$ openssl genrsa -out pkey.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
....................................................................+++
.............+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:node-sales john$ openssl req -new -key pkey.key -out pkey.csr -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=sales'
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:node-sales john$ openssl x509 -req -in pkey.csr -CA ../int/int.pem -CAkey ../int/int.key -CAcreateserial \
> -CAserial intermediateCA.srl -out pkey.pem -days 365
Signature ok
subject=/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=sales
Getting CA Private Key
----

 .. Repeat the same step in each node directory you have.
Each time another set of node keys will be generated.
+
----
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:node-hr john$ ls
intermediateCA.srl	pkey.csr		pkey.key		pkey.pem
----

. Verify the node-intermediate-root chain.
 .. Try to specify the node certificate `pkey.pem`:
+
----
openssl verify -verbose pkey.pem
----
+
The response should be similar to the following:
+
----
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:node-sales john$ openssl verify -verbose pkey.pem
pkey.pem: /C=UA/O=My Company/CN=sales
error 20 at 0 depth lookup:unable to get local issuer certificate
----
+
This means that the certificate at `depth=0` (intermediate certificate) cannot be looked up.

 .. Next, letâ€™s try to specify an intermediate certificate:
+
----
openssl verify -untrusted ../int/int.pem pkey.pem
----
+
The response should be similar to the following:
+
----
pkey.pem: /C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Intermediate CA
error 20 at 1 depth lookup:unable to get local issuer certificate
----
+
This means that the certificate at `depth=1` (root certificate) cannot be looked up.

 .. Next, letâ€™s try to specify the root certificate:
+
----
openssl verify -untrusted ../int/int.pem -CAfile ../root/ca.pem pkey.pem
----
+
The response will be:
+
----
pkey.pem: OK
----
+
This means that certificate validation has passed.
. Generate a certificate chain file.
+
When a client application tries to verify a certificate signed by the intermediate CA, it must also verify the intermediate certificate against the root certificate.
To complete the chain of trust, create a certificate chain to present it to the application.
+
In a chain file, the lowest certificate goes first, then the intermediate certificates in proper order.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not include in your chain file the root CAâ€™s public key certificate and intermediate certificates that are not in the trust path.
+
NOTE: The root certificate is not included in this chain.
+
To create the certificate chain file, concatenate the intermediate and root certificates together, beginning with the lowest one in the chain.

 ** If you have only one intermediate CA in your trust path, use this command:
+
----
cat pkey.pem ../int/int.pem > chain.pem
----

 ** If you have more intermediate CAs in your trust path, keep in mind that the order of certificates in an SSL Certificate Chain file is important:

  *** `pkey.pem` certificate is signed by intermediate (`int3.pem`) certificate
  *** `int3.pem` is signed by intermediate (`int2.pem`)
  *** `int2.pem` is signed by intermediate (`int1.pem`)

+
For multiple intermediate CAs, use this command:
+
----
cat pkey.pem ../int3/int.pem ../int2/int.pem ../int1/int.pem  > chain.pem
----

. Copy the node private key (`pkey.key)` and the chain file (`chain.pem`) manually to the `inbox` folder on each node.
 .. Create an `inbox` folder in the Couchbase server path:
+
----
mkdir /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox
----
+
For example:
+
----
mkdir /Users/john/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox
----

 .. Now go to the directory [.path]_SSLCA/node_ and copy the files `chain.pem` and `pkey.key` into the created `inbox` folder:
+
----
cp chain.pem /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/chain.pem
cp pkey.key /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/pkey.pem
----
+
For example:
+
----
cp chain.pem /Users/john/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/chain.pem
cp pkey.key /Users/john/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/pkey.key
----
+
Check if the the files `chain.pem` and `pkey.key` have been posted to the inbox:
+
----
johns-MacBook-Pro-4:inbox john$ ls
chain.pem	pkey.key
----
. Change permissions so that Couchbase can read `pkey.key` and `chain.pem:`
+
----
cd /Users/<username>/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/inbox/
chmod 777 chain.pem
chmod 777 pkey.pem
----

. Set up the cluster certificate and then a node certificate on each of the nodes.

== Setting up a Cluster CA Certificate

[#rotate-x509]
== Rotating X.509

Certificate rotation is needed when a certificate expires, if you are considering moving from an old CA authority to a new CA authority, there is a change in the policy of the certificates issued by the CA, or in the case of a widespread breach of security occurs in the system.

You need to have a plan in place to renew the CA well before it expires.
X.509 certificate rotation in Couchbase is an online operation and does not require a node or cluster restart.
You can be reassured that the application will have continued access to Couchbase without getting hit with a downtime during the rotation operation.

*How to Rotate an X.509 Certificate in Couchbase*

. *Generate a new certificate.*
+
Before you rotate a certificate, you need to generate a new certificate.
+
Typically, your Certificate Authority (CA) will give you a self-service option to re-issue certificates.
If this is not the case, you can manually regenerate your new X509 certificate.

 .. Renew the root CA certificate
+
The root certificate authority (CA) is the topmost CA in a CA hierarchy.
Its validity period is typically longer, between 10 and 20 years.
+
NOTE: When you renew the root CA, you have the option of reusing its existing private key.
If you keep the same private key on your root CA, all certificates can continue to validate successfully against the new root; all that's required of you is to trust the new root.

 .. Generate the root CA for the first time
+
----
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
                      openssl req -new -x509  -days 3650 -sha256 -key ca.key -out ca.pem \
                      -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Root CA'
----

 .. After ten years, the renewal time for the root CA comes up!
  *** Renew the root CA using the existing `ca.key`:
+
----
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out newcsr.csr
                        openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -sha256 -in newcsr.csr -signkey newca.key -out newca.pem
----

  *** Generate a completely new root CA similar to what you did the first time:
+
----
openssl genrsa -out newca.key 2048
                        openssl req -new -x509  -days 3650 -sha256 -key newca.key -out newca.pem \
                        -subj '/C=UA/O=My Company/CN=My Company Root CA'
----
 .. Renew the intermediate certificates.
+
For the intermediate CAs, a possible strategy might be to renew them for a year to six months before they expire and reuse the existing key.
+
By replacing the old chain file with the new chain file (that contains the updated intermediate certificate), rotation of the intermediate certificate can be performed:
+
----
> cat pkey.pem ../int/newint.pem <possibly other intermediate CAs> > chain.pem
----

. *Deploy the CA public key and intermediate certificates*
+
Before modifying anything on the server-side, deploy the CA public key and intermediate certificates in the certificate stores used by your client browser and the SDK language.
+
For example, here are steps to do that for http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/firefox-adding-trusted-ca/[Firefox^] and http://blogmines.com/blog/how-to-import-a-certificate-in-google-chrome/[Chrome^].

. *Rotate certificates on the server*
 .. Configure the new root CA certificate (`newca.pem` is the new root CA certificate).
  *** Using CLI:
+
----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c <node-name>:8091 -u Administrator -p password \
                        --upload-cluster-ca=newca.pem
----

  *** Using REST:
+
----
curl -X POST --data-binary "@newca.pem" \
                        http://Administrator:password@127.0.0.1:8091/controller/uploadClusterCA
----
 .. Configure the new intermediate and node certificate.
+
For each node, copy over new `chain.pem` file, and per node private key (new `pkey.pem` file, if the node certificate is rotated) to the `inbox` folder.

  *** Using CLI:
+
----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c <node-name>:8091 -u Administrator -p password \
                        --set-node-certificate
----

  *** Using REST:
+
----
curl -X POST http://Administrator:password@[node-name]:8091/node/controller/reloadCertificate
----
. *Test the server CA certificate*
+
You can also use OpenSSL's `s_client` by trying to connect to a server that you know is using a certificate signed by the CA that you just installed:
+
----
> openssl s_client -connect https://<hostname>:8091 -CApath <root ca public key>
----

. *Troubleshoot X.509 certificates*
+
During the development process these external tools might come in handy for verifying and debugging SSL traffic:

 ** [.cmd]`openssl`: OpenSSL command line tool
 ** wireshark: Network traffic analyzer
 ** nmap: Sophisticated security scanner

. *Revert from the X.509 to the self-signed certificate*
+
If you configured Couchbase to use X.509 certificates, and you want to go back to the self-signed certificates, you can do this by regenerating the self-signed cluster certificate using CLI or REST.
+
WARNING: Moving from CA certificates to self-signed certificates will cause application downtime because you need to reconfigure the self-signed cluster certificate on the client machines after self-signed certificate regeneration.

 ** Using CLI:
+
----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage -c <hostname>:8091 -u Administrator -p password \
                        --regenerate-cert=/tmp/test.pem
----

== Troubleshooting X.509

This section lists the error messages connected to the configuration of cluster and node certificates in Couchbase.

*Cluster CA Certificates*

Here are some error messages you might encounter when configuring the cluster CA certificate and the suggested corrective actions:

.Error messages when configuring cluster CA certificates
|===
| Couchbase Error Message | Description | Suggested User Action

| `Certificate should not be empty`
| This error message can occur if the request body of the certificate is empty.
| Open the certificate file, and verify whether it is empty or not.
The certificate file should be readable using openssl or via online SSL tools such as https://www.sslchecker.com/certdecoder[sslcheker^].

| `Certificate is not valid at this time`
| This error message can occur if the certificate has expired, or is not yet valid.
| Verify whether the certificate validity dates (begins on, and expires on) are currently valid corresponding to the server clock time.

| `Malformed certificate`
| This error message can occur due to many reasons - an extra space in the certificate digest body, incorrect certificate format, and so on.
| Use a properly configured certificate, and make sure itâ€™s readable using `openssl`.
It should look as follows: Certificate begins with

`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`

and ends with

`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`

on a new line with no spaces before or after.

| `Only one certificate per request is allowed`
| Appears when the file contains more than one key or certificate.
| Open the `.pem` file, and make sure that it has only a single certificate digest (such as single `BEGIN CERTIFICATE,` `END CERTIFICATE` pragmas).

| `Encrypted certificates are not supported`
| This error message can occur if you are trying to load a certificate that is encrypted.
Verify by opening the certificate file.
If you see something like shown below, you will know your certificate is encrypted.:

`-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
a|
Couchbase does not support encrypted certificates.
Decrypt the certificate with `openssl` before loading the certificate in Couchbase.

----
openssl rsa -in privateKey.pem -out newPrivateKey.pem
----

| `Invalid certificate type: ~s`
| Appears when a header other than `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` has been found.
