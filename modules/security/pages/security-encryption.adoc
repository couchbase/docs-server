[abstract]
Couchbase uses encryption to protect data, throughout the system.

Data encryption is used to prevent access to sensitive data.
Couchbase Server supports the encryption of data that is at rest (on disk), on the wire, and held by applications.
Additionally, it provides a system of _Secret-Management_, which allows information essential to the security and maintenance of Couchbase Server itself to be stored in encrypted form; and then decrypted and appropriately used at cluster-startup.
