== Audit Events

The Couchbase Server _auditing_ facility recognizes specific _events_, which can be selectively logged.
The output is written to a log-file, which is periodically rotated.

An overview of event-auditing is provided in xref:learn:security/auditing.adoc[Auditing].
An explanation of how to enable the auditing and filtering of certain events is provided in xref:manage:manage-security/manage-auditing.adoc[Manage Auditing].

The current page lists all events that can be audited.

== Event Tables

The events listed in the following tables support the auditing of administrative and data changes, made on the cluster.

In each table, the first column (at the left) features the event-group heading (thereby repeating the table’s title, so as to ensure readability throughout the longer tables).
The second column provides the event name.
The third column provides the id for the event.
The fourth column provides a description of the event; the fifth describes whether it is _filterable_; and the sixth indicates whether the event is classified as Data or Admin.

The tables — which are for the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#rest-api-event-list-table[REST API], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#data-service-event-list-table[Data Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#query-service-event-list-table[Query Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#search-service-event-list-table[Search Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#eventing-service-event-list-table[Eventing Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#analytics-service-event-list-table[Analytics Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#backup-service-event-list-table[Backup Service], the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#view-engine-event-list-table[View Engine], and the xref:audit-event-reference:audit-event-reference.adoc#audit-event-list-table[Audit] facility itself — are as follows.
