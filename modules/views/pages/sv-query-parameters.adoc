= Querying spatial views

[abstract]
Spatial views are retrieved with the REST API `GET /[bucket-name]/_design/[design-doc]/_spatial/[spatial-name]` HTTP method and URI.

== HTTP method and URI

----
GET /[bucket-name]/_design/[design-doc]/_spatial/[spatial-name]

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| HTTP | Description

| Method and URI
| `GET /[bucket-name]/_design/[design-doc]/_spatial/[spatial-name]`

| Request Data
| None

| Response Data
| JSON of the documents returned by the view

NOTE: The `start_range` and `end_range` parameters take a JSON array and are preferred over the `bbox` parameter.

.Query parameters
[cols="2,3,6"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Description

| `start_range`
| Array of numeric or null; optional
| The number of elements must match the number of dimensions of the index.

| `end_range`
| Array of numeric or null; optional
| The number of elements must match the number of dimensions of the index.

| `bbox`
| String; optional
| Specify the bounding box for a spatial query.

| `limit`
| Numeric; optional
| Limit the number of the returned documents to the specified number.

| `skip`
| Numeric; optional
| Skip this number of records before starting to return the results.

| `stale`
| String; optional

* `false `
+
The server waits for the indexer to finish the changes that correspond to the current key-value document set and then returns the latest entries from the view file.

* `ok `
+
The server returns the current entries from the view file.

* `update_after `
+
The server returns the current entries from the view file, and then initiates an view file update.
| Specifies the level of data freshness.


|===

When submitting a view query, the `stale` parameter is used to specify the data freshness.
The `stale` parameter the following values:

* `ok`—The server returns the current entries from the index file.
* `update_after`—The server returns the current entries from the index, and then initiates an index update.
* `false`—The server waits for the indexer to finish the changes that correspond to the current key-value document set and then returns the latest entries from the view index.

Every 5 seconds the automatic update process checks whether 5000 changes have occurred.
If a minimum of 5000 changes occurred, an view file update is triggered.
Otherwise, no update is triggered.
When triggered, the indexer requests from DCP all changes since it was last run.
The default number of changes to check for is 5000, but that number can be configured by setting the `updateMinChanges` option.
The update interval can also be configured by setting the `updateInterval` option.

The `stale=false` view query argument has been enhanced.
When an application sends a query that has the `stale` parameter set to false, the application receives all recent changes to the documents, including changes that haven't yet been persisted to disk.
It considers all document changes that have been received at the time the query was received.

You can issue the `stale=false` view query anytime and results will fetch all changes that have been made when the query was issued.

[caption="Best practice"]
TIP: For better scalability and throughput, set the value of the `stale` parameter to `ok`.
With the stream-based views, data returned when `stale` is set to `ok` is closer to the key-value data, even though it might not include all of it.

== Responses

The standard response includes `total_rows`, `id`, `key`, `value`, and `geometry`.
The `total_rows` item is always zero.
The `geometry` item is not shown if no geometry was emitted.
If a geometry was emitted, the `key` contains the ranges of the calculated bounding box.

{"total_rows":0, "rows": [{
    "id":"id-name"
    "key": [[value, value], [value, value]],
    "value": null,
    "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [value, value]}
}]}

Example response if geometry was emitted:

----
{"total_rows":0, "rows": [{
    "id":"Augsburg"
    "key": [[10.9, 10.9], [48.4, 48.4]],
    "value": null,
    "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [10.9, 48.4]}
}]}
----

Example response if geometry was not emitted:

----
{"total_rows":0, "rows": [{
    "id":"Augsburg"
    "key": [[10.9, 10.9], [48.4, 48.4]], [1000, 2000]],
    "value": null,
