[#sv-ex1-query-nonintersect]
= Querying on Non-intersect

[abstract]
This query retrieves data based on the GeoJSON polygon example and on bounding box parameters that are within the query range.

== Description

Queries only filter on a bounding box level.
This means that even if the actual geometry doesn't intersect the query ranges but its bounding box does, it is still included in the result.

== HTTP method and URI

----
GET [bucket-name]/_design/[design-doc]/_spatial/[spatial-name]
----

== Syntax

Curl syntax:

----
curl http://[localhost]:8092/[bucket-name]/_design/[design-doc]/_spatial/[spatial-name]?start_range=[]&end_range=[]
----

== Example

The following example is based on the GeoJSON polygon data and the associated spatial view function.

Curl example:

----
curl http://10.5.2.54:8092/default/_design/areas/_spatial/locAndArea?start_range=[-84,29,null]&end_range=[-72,37,null]
----

== Response

The response shows that the ranges don't intersect the polygon of the Bermuda Triangle, but its enclosing bounding box does which can be found in its key.
