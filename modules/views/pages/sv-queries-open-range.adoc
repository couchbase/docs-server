= Open Range Queries

[abstract]
Open range queries specify `null` as a value on either one or both sides of the range.

For example, to query shops in Germany that are open between 10:00 and 20:00.

In this case, the emit could be:

[source,javascript]
----
emit([{
   "type": "Point",
   "coordinates":[10.9, 48.4]
}, [1000, 2000]], null);
----

To query for shops in Germany with an opening time of 10:00 and no closing time:

----
?start_range=[5.87,47.27,1000]&end_range=[15.04,55.06,null]
----

To query for shops in Germany with no opening time and a closing time of 20:00:

----
?start_range=[5.87,47.27,null]&end_range=[15.04,55.06,2000]
----

To query for shops in Germany with no opening or closing time:

----
?start_range=[5.87,47.27,null]&end_range=[15.04,55.06,null]
----

To query for shops anywhere (no location specified) with an opening time of 10:00 and a closing time of 20:00:

----
?start_range=[null,null,1000]&end_range=[null,null,2000]
----
