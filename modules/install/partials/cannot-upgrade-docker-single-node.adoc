.Re-using existing volumes
****
You cannot re-use existing volumes when replacing a docker container, so it is not possible to use the same data set by pointing the new container at an existing volume.

*This does mean that it is not possible to upgrade a Docker Couchbase container with only a single node available for use.*

To prevent unusable volumes from building up during upgrades, it's important to delete the unused volumes during the process to decrease the chances of running out of disk space.
