== Online Upgrade at Reduced and Full Capacity

A Couchbase-Server cluster can be upgraded while continuing to serve data.
A _spare node_ must be used, if the cluster is to serve data at full capacity for the duration of the upgrade.
If no spare node is available, the cluster must serve data at reduced capacity, for the duration of the upgrade.
The available procedures are provided as follows:
