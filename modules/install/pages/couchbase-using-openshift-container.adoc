= Running Couchbase Server Using Red Hat OpenShift

[abstract]
Using Red Hat OpenShift, it is easy get started with Couchbase Server.
This topic walks you through the steps to get started with the simplest topology: single host, single container.

Step 1 Ensure that Red Hat OpenShift Cluster is installed and running in your environment::
Take a look at the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/welcome/index.html[Red Hat OpenShift documentation^] for details.
You can skip this step if you have Docker Engine installed already.

Step 2 Download the RHEL 7 image available through the Red Hat Registry::
+
----
$docker pull registry.connect.redhat.com/couchbase/server
----

Step 3 Start the Couchbase Server container ’db’ using the following command::
+
----
$docker run -d --name db -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 couchbase
----
+
This command downloads and runs the container tagged "latest" from the Couchbase repo on the Red Hat Container Catalog.
+
NOTE: If you have Couchbase Server running locally on the machine without containers, the port mappings above under the `-p` option may fail.
Ensure that you stop your local instance of Couchbase Server before running the above command.

Step 4 Access the Web Console::
Access the Web Console using [.path]_\http://localhost:8091_.
If the container is up and running, you'll see the Couchbase Server Setup Screen.

Step 5 Set up Couchbase Server::
Walk through the Setup New Cluster wizard and accept the default values.
You may need to lower the RAM allocated to various services to fit within the bounds of the resource for the containers.
For detailed information on setting up the Couchbase server, see xref:init-setup.adoc#topic12527[Initializing the Cluster].
Add the sample buckets ‘travel-sample’ and ‘beer-sample’ to load sample data that’s ready for immediate experimentation and testing.

You now have a working Couchbase Server instance.
