= Using Hostnames

[abstract]
Each individual Couchbase Server-node can be referenced by a hostname, as well as by an IP address.
You can specify a node's hostname by using either the Couchbase Web Console or the REST API, during the process of node-configuration and cluster-definition.

== Specifying a Hostname

Initial configuration of Couchbase Server allows the node to be referenced by means of a default IP address: `127.0.0.1`.
You may choose to specify a different IP address, or a _hostname_.
The hostname must be valid, and must ultimately resolve to a valid IP Address.

If you restart a node, Couchbase Server continues to use the specified hostname.
Note, however, that if you fail over, or remove the node from a cluster, Couchbase Server will no longer use the specified hostname: therefore, in such circumstances, you must reconfigure the node, in order to _re-specify_ the hostname.

You can specify a hostname when performing initial configuration of Couchbase Server; when adding a node to an existing cluster; or _before_ adding a node to a cluster, by means of a REST API call.
Each of these options is described below.

== Provide a Hostname on Initial Configuration

In the [.ui]*Cluster Name* panel, on the [.ui]*Couchbase > New Cluster* dialog, you can enter either a hostname or a specific IP address into the interactive text-field.

== Provide a Hostname while Adding a Node

Nodes can be added to a cluster by means of the [.ui]*Server* tab, visible on the vertical navigation-bar at the left-hand side of the Couchbase Web Console.
This displays the [.ui]*Servers* screen, on which the btn:[Add Server] button is located, at the upper-right.
Left-click on this button to display the [.ui]*Add Server Node* dialog:

[#add_server_node]

Enter either a hostname or IP address into the interactive [.ui]*Server IP Address* text-field.

== Provide a Hostname using the REST API

The REST API provides the endpoint `/node/controller/rename`, which can be used to specify a hostname _before_ the node has been added to a cluster.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:adm1npwd \
http://127.0.0.1:8091/node/controller/rename -d hostname=shz.localdomain
----

Note that if the node is already part of a cluster, Couchbase Server rejects the request; returning the following error:

[source,bash]
----
error 400 reason: unknown ["Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are
already part of a cluster"]
----

== Hostname Errors

If the hostname you specify is invalid, or has been specified at an inappropriate point in the configuration or node-addition sequence, an error is returned.
The following are examples of errors that you might encounter:

[source,bash]
----
Could not resolve the host name. The host name you provide as a parameter
does not resolve to a IP address.

Could not listen. The host name resolves to an IP address, but no network
connection exists for the address.

Could not rename the node because name was fixed at server start-up.

Could not save address after rename.

Requested name host name is not allowed. Invalid host name provided.

Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are already part of a cluster.
