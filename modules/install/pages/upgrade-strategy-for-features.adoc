= Upgrading to Couchbase Server 6.5

Upgrading to the latest version of Couchbase Server allows you to leverage the latest features and helps keep your cluster running well.
The following table summarizes the new features in this release, and describes what parts of the cluster need to be upgraded to enable them.

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,2"]
|===
| Feature | Upgrade Level | xref:upgrade-strategies.adoc[Upgrade Type] | xref:upgrade.adoc#supported-upgrade-paths[Upgrade Path] | <<feature-mixed-mode,Mixed Mode>> | Dependencies

| Durability
| Cluster
| Offline/Online
| Direct
| No
| Existing Observe APIs for replicateTo and persistTo will continue to exist.

The new APIs for synchronous durability require Server 6.5 and SDK 3.0. 

| Robust rebalance
| Cluster
| Offline/Online
| Direct
| No
| Available only when all nodes in a cluster are upgraded to 6.5.

| Transactions
| Cluster
| Offline/Online
| Direct
| No
| For XDCR setup, both source and target clusters must be on 6.5+ if transactions are used at the source cluster.

SDK 3.0 has to be used for the new APIs.

| Node-to-node encryption
| Cluster
| Offline
| First upgrade to 6.5 and then enable node-to-node encryption on every node using the API/CLI. Restart server for encryption to be effective.
| No
| With node-to-node encryption (and data option), newer TLS ports will be opened between services. If your firewalls are locked down to just the bare minimum ports, you will have to update your firewall rules to include the newer ports. 

See xref:install-ports.adoc[Network and Firewall Requirements] for the list of ports.

| TLS cipher configuration 
| Cluster
| Offline/Online
| Direct
| No
| Available only when all nodes in a cluster are upgraded to 6.5.

| LDAP Group Support
| Cluster/Node
| Offline/Online
| Direct
| No
| Groups are not created during upgrade and built-in users continue to exist. A full administrator must create Couchbase Groups, add built-in users to these groups, and map Couchbase groups to Couchbase roles.

[[feature-mixed-mode]]
[float]
=== Mixed Mode

Mixed Mode in this context refers only to the nodes that are running the indicated service.
So if **No** is marked in the Mixed Mode column for a given feature, then all of the cluster nodes that are running that service must be upgraded to Couchbase Server 6.5 in order to enable that feature.
If **Yes**, then the feature can potentially be enabled even if some of the nodes that are running the indicated service are on older versions of Couchbase Server.
