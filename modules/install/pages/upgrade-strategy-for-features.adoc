[#upgrade-ipv6]
== Migrating Data from an IPv4 Cluster to an IPv6 Cluster

You can migrate data from an IPv4 cluster to an IPv6 cluster with an offline upgrade, or online by using unilateral replication.
You must ensure that your operating system has dual stack support.

*Offline Upgrade from an IPv4 Cluster to an IPv6 Cluster*

_Prerequisites_: Ensure that the source cluster is on an operating system with dual stack support.

Follow the instructions available in the section xref:upgrade-offline.adoc[Performing the Offline Upgrade].
When all the nodes are offline, restart each node with IPv6 enabled.
See xref:ipv6-setup.adoc[Using IPv6 With Couchbase] for instructions to enable IPv6.

*Online Upgrade from an IPv4 Cluster to an IPv6 Cluster using XDCR*

_Prerequisites_: Ensure that the source cluster is running Couchbase Server 5.5 on an operating system with dual stack support, and the destination cluster is running Couchbase Server 5.5 on an IPv6 network.

_Steps_:

. Upgrade the source cluster to Couchbase Server version 5.5.
. Create a new cluster with IPv6 enabled and configured.
See xref:ipv6-setup.adoc[Using IPv6 With Couchbase] for instructions to enable IPv6.
Note that this cluster needs to be sized appropriately for the workload, but does not need to be identical to the source cluster.
. xref:xdcr:xdcr-create.adoc[Create a cluster reference and replication stream] from the source to the destination cluster.
At this point, the destination cluster is not receiving any application load directly, other than the replication traffic from the source cluster.
. xref:monitoring:ui-monitoring-statistics.adoc#outgoing_xdcr_stats[Monitor the XDCR queue] from the source until all mutations are replicated to the destination cluster.
. Reconfigure the application to start accessing the destination cluster.
. Once all your applications have been moved, you can decommission the source cluster.

IMPORTANT: IPv4 and IPv6 clusters cannot be paired for bi-directional (active-active) XDCR replication.
For bi-directional replication, both clusters need to be using IPv4 or IPv6.
