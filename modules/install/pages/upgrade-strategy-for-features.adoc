[[feature-mixed-mode]]
[float]
=== Mixed Mode

Mixed Mode in this context refers only to the nodes that are running the indicated service.
So if **No** is marked in the Mixed Mode column for a given feature, then all of the cluster nodes that are running that service must be upgraded to Couchbase Server 6.5 in order to enable that feature.
If **Yes**, then the feature can potentially be enabled even if some of the nodes that are running the indicated service are on older versions of Couchbase Server.

[[prepared-statements]]
[float]
=== Prepared Statement Upgrades

When performing an online upgrade from Couchbase Server 6.0.3 or earlier to Couchbase Server 6.5 (or later), an improvement to Couchbase Server security in N1QL may cause active Couchbase SDK 2.x applications to return the error `4040: No such prepared statement`. _Note that 2.x here refers to the 2.x SDK API, and so includes Couchbase Go SDK 1.x._

Client-side workarounds:

* Restart the application server after the server upgrade.
This implicitly clears the client cache, leading it to prepare statements again.
* Change the application code.
If the application receives an error `4040`, clean the cache using `invalidateQueryCache()` and retry.
(This only works for Java.)
* Upgrade to Java SDK 2.7.13; Go SDK 1.6.6; or LCB 2.10.6 (for C, Node.js, PHP, or Python SDK), or to SDK 3.0.

Server-side workarounds:

. Upgrade the first node -- this can be a Data service node, or any other node.

. Increase the prepared statement cache size.
In the Query Workbench, go to menu:Settings[General > Query Settings > Advanced Query Settings] and set *Prepared Limit* to `66560`.

. Make sure that `encoded_plan` will be honored.
Also in menu:Settings[General > Query Settings > Advanced Query Settings], set *N1QL Feature Controller* to `8`.

These settings persist, and will be used as other query service nodes are upgraded.
