= Installing on Windows

[abstract]
Installation using a package management system on Windows.

This installation guide only supports 64-bit systems.
Windows 7 and 8 are supported only for development purposes.
See xref:install-platforms.adoc#topic1634[Supported platforms] for details.

== Prerequisites

To install Couchbase Server on Windows, you need to perform following prerequisites:

[#ol_uvd_nbv_vs]
. Make sure that you have no anti-virus software running on the machine before you start the installation process.
. Verify that you have administrator privileges using a local system account on the machine where you are performing the installation.
. By default, on Windows the TCP/IP has default number of ports available for client communication.
+
You need to follow the information provided in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx[Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion] to adjust the configuration and increase the number of available ports.

. By default, the Windows system does not provide an adequate number of ephemeral ports for Couchbase Server clusters.
Without the correct number of open ephemeral ports, you can experience errors during rebalance, timeouts on clients, and failed backups.
+
The Couchbase Server installer will automatically check for your current port setting and adjust it if needed.
See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196271[Microsoft KB-196271].

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Server uses the Microsoft C++ redistributable package, which is automatically downloaded during installation.
However, if another application on your machine is already using the package, your installation process can fail.
To make sure that your installation process completes successfully, shut down all other running applications during installation.
For Windows 2008, you must upgrade your Windows Server 2008 R2 installation with Service Pack 1 installed before running Couchbase Server.
You can obtain Service Pack 1 from https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817647(v=ws.10).aspx[Microsoft TechNet].

== Downloading on Windows Systems

You can download Couchbase Server directly using the [.cmd]`wget.exe` command for Windows or Powershell scripting.

The basic syntax of the [.cmd]`wget` command is:

 $ wget [option]... [url]...

For example, the following command downloads a version of Couchbase Server and that runs on Windows Server 2012 R2:

 $ wget.exe --no-check-certificate http://packages.couchbase.com/releases/version/couchbase-server-enterprise-version-windows_amd64.exe

== Interactive Installation

To install Couchbase Server on Windows using interactive install wizard follow the steps below:

. In Windows Explorer, locate the downloaded `Couchbase Server.exe` file, which typically is located in the default Downloads folder.
Double click on the executable file.
+
The installer for Windows detects if you need to install any redistributable packages included with Couchbase Server.
If these packages are not already on your system, they are automatically installed along with Couchbase Server.

. You will be prompted with the Installation Location screen.
You can change the location where the Couchbase Server application is located, which configures the server location and not the location where the persistent data is stored.
+
The installer copies necessary files to the system.
During the installation process, the installer also verifies that the default administration port is not already in use by another application.
If the default port is unavailable, the installer prompts for a different port to be used for administration of Couchbase Server.
The installer asks you to set up sufficient ports available for the node.
+
By default, Microsoft Server will not have an adequate number of ephemeral ports, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196271[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 196271]:

. Click [.uicontrol]*Yes* to continue.
+
Without a sufficient number of ephemeral ports, a Couchbase Server cluster fails during rebalance and backup.
Other operations, such as client requests, will time-out.
If you already changed this setting, you can click No.
The installer displays this panel to confirm the update.

. After installation, follow the server setup instructions.

[caption=Attention]
IMPORTANT: If the Windows installer hangs on the Computing Space Requirements screen, there is an issue with your setup or installation environment, such as other running applications.

You can implement this workaround to complete the installation:

. Stop any other browsers and applications that were running when you started installing Couchbase Server.
. Kill the installation process and uninstall the failed setup.
. Delete or rename the temp location under [.path]_C:\Users\[logonuser]\AppData\Temp_.
. Reboot and try again.

== Unattended Installation

An unattended installation, also referred to as silent or headless installation, uses a script to install Couchbase Server.

To use the unattended installation process:

. Record your installation settings in the wizard installation.
These settings are saved to a file, which is used to silently install other nodes of the same version.
 .. Open a Command Terminal or Power and start the installation executable with the `/r` command-line option:
+
----
> couchbase_server_version.exe /r /f1your_file_name.iss
----

 .. Provide your installation options when prompted.
Accept an increase in `MaxUserPort` (recommended).
+
The wizard completes the server installation and provides a file with your recorded options at [.path]_C:\Windows\your_file_name.iss_.
+
NOTE: Refer to a sample installation settings file available in the following https://gist.github.com/arun-gupta/a3858d6fc0cdfac5afa27f650844619b[gist].
. Copy the `your_file_name.iss` file into the same directory as the installer executable.
Run the installer from the command-line using the `/s` option:

----
> couchbase_server_version.exe /s -f1your_file_name.iss
----

. To repeat this process on multiple machines, copy the installation package and the `your_file_name.iss` file to the same directory on each machine.
