= Installing on Windows

[abstract]
Installation using a package management system on Windows.

This installation guide only supports both 32 and 64-bit systems.
Windows 7 and 8 are supported only for development purposes.
See xref:install-platforms.adoc#topic1634[Supported platforms] for details.

== Prerequisites

To install Couchbase Server on Windows, you need to perform following prerequisites:

[#ol_uvd_nbv_vs]
. Make sure that you have no anti-virus software running on the machine before you start the installation process.
. Verify that you have administrator privileges using a local system account on the machine where you are performing the installation.
. By default, on Windows the TCP/IP has default number of ports available for client communication.
+
You need to follow the information provided in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa560610(v=bts.20).aspx[Avoiding TCP/IP Port Exhaustion] to adjust the configuration and increase the number of available ports.

. By default, the Windows system does not provide an adequate number of ephemeral ports for Couchbase Server clusters.
Without the correct number of open ephemeral ports, you can experience errors during rebalance, timeouts on clients, and failed backups.
+
The Couchbase Server installer will automatically check for your current port setting and adjust it if needed.
See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/196271[Microsoft KB-196271].

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Server uses the Microsoft C++ redistributable package, which is automatically downloaded during installation.
However, if another application on your machine is already using the package, your installation process can fail.
To make sure that your installation process completes successfully, shut down all other running applications during installation.
For Windows 2008, you must upgrade your Windows Server 2008 R2 installation with Service Pack 1 installed before running Couchbase Server.
You can obtain Service Pack 1 from https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff817647(v=ws.10).aspx[Microsoft TechNet].

== Downloading on Windows Systems

You can download Couchbase Server directly using the [.cmd]`wget.exe` command for Windows or Powershell scripting.

The basic syntax of the [.cmd]`wget` command is:

 $ wget [option]... [url]...

For example, the following command downloads a version of Couchbase Server and that runs on Windows Server 2012 R2:

 $ wget.exe --no-check-certificate http://packages.couchbase.com/releases/version/couchbase-server-enterprise-version-windows_amd64.exe
