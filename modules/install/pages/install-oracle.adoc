== Before You Install

Couchbase Server works out-of-the-box on most Oracle Linux configurations.
However, you should review the following material before installing, especially if you're deploying Couchbase into production:

* Ensure that you've met the xref:plan-for-production.adoc[minimum system requirements] and that your operating system version is xref:install-platforms.adoc[supported].
* Follow the xref:install-production-deployment.adoc[deployment guidelines] to ensure that your systems and environment are properly sized and configured.
* Only the Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK) is supported.
The Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) is not supported.

== Basic Installation

You must be logged in as root (superuser) or use `sudo` to run the installation commands.

=== Install Using `.rpm` Package

Install Couchbase Server on Oracle Linux using the full `.rpm` package that you downloaded from Couchbase.

. Download the appropriate package for your operating system from the Couchbase https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[downloads page^].

. Install Couchbase Server.
+
[source,console]
----
rpm -install couchbase-server-*.rpm
----
+
...where `*` is the edition and version of the downloaded package.

Once installation is complete, Couchbase Server will start automatically (and will continue to start automatically at run levels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and explicitly shut down at run levels 0, 1, and 6).
You can use the `systemctl` command (`service` on older operating systems) to start and stop the Couchbase Server service, as well as check the current status.
