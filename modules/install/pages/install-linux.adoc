Couchbase Server runs on several Linux systems: Red Hat, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, SuSE Enterprise, and Oracle Enterprise.

You can download Couchbase Server for your OS directly from https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[^].

Links to the distribution-specific installation instructions for Linux can be found below:

* xref:ubuntu-debian-install.adoc[Ubuntu and Debian]
* xref:install_suse.adoc[SUSE Enterprise Linux]
* xref:install-oracle.adoc[Oracle Enterprise Linux]
* xref:amazon-linux2-install.adoc[Amazon Linux 2] (Requires Couchbase Server 6.0.1+)

For information on installing Couchbase Server on IPv6 systems, see xref:ipv6-setup.adoc[IP Version 6: Set-Up Procedures].

IMPORTANT: RHEL6 and other newer Linux distributions are known to have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) feature enabled by default.
THP can cause issues in database software, including Couchbase Server.
THP can cause nodes to lose cluster heartbeats, resulting in erroneous automatic failovers.
xref:thp-disable.adoc[Disabling THP] prior to installing Couchbase Server is strongly encouraged.
