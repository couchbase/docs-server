Couchbase Server runs on several Linux systems: Red Hat, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, SuSE Enterprise, Oracle Enterprise, and Amazon Linux.

You can download Couchbase Server for your OS directly from https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[^].

[IMPORTANT]
====
RHEL6 and other newer Linux distributions are known to have Transparent Huge Pages (THP) feature enabled by default.
THP can cause issues in database software, including Couchbase Server.
THP can cause nodes to lose cluster heartbeats, resulting in erroneous automatic failovers.
xref:thp-disable.adoc[Disabling THP] prior to installing Couchbase Server is strongly encouraged.

RHEL8 does not include a Python installation by default. + 
For  Couchbase Server *6.0.2*, *6.0.3*, or *6.0.4* installed on RHEL8, ensure that Python2 is installed, set on the PATH and aliased as `python`.
