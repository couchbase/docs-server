{description}

The pages in this section each provide step-by-step instructions for the upgrade of a Couchbase-Server cluster.
Each procedure addresses a specific context and its associated dependencies: for information on how to select the appropriate procedure, see the information provided in xref:install:upgrade-strategies.adoc[Upgrade Procedure-Selection].

To perform any of these procedures, the administrator must have the *Full Admin* or the *Cluster Admin* role.
For information, see xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].



The procedures are presented as follows:

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc[Upgrade an Offline Cluster].
This is the simplest procedure for the upgrade of a multi-node cluster.
Note, however, that it requires cluster-downtime.

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online.adoc[Upgrade an Online Cluster].
This allows the cluster to continue serving data, for the duration of the upgrade.
Two options are provided:

** xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc[Upgrade at Reduced Capacity].
If no additional nodes are available to facilitate the upgrade-procedure, the procedure can be completed with the existing cluster-nodes, provided that it is acceptable for the cluster to serve data, during the upgrade, at reduced capacity.

** xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-full-capacity.adoc[Upgrade at Full Capacity].
If additional nodes are available to facilitate the upgrade-procedure, the procedure can be completed with the cluster continuing to serve data at full capacity.

* xref:install:upgrade-to-ipv6.adoc[Upgrade an IPv6 Cluster].
Special instructions are provided for the upgrade of IPv6 clusters.
