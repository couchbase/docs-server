{description}

This section provides step-by-step instructions for the upgrade of multi-node Couchbase-Server clusters.
Each procedure addresses a specific context and its associated dependencies: for information on how to select the appropriate procedure, see the information provided in xref:install:upgrade-procedure-selection.adoc[Upgrade Procedure-Selection].

Additionally provided on this page is guidance for xref:install:upgrade-procedures.adoc#upgrading-developer-clusters[Upgrading Developer Clusters] &#8212; which are frequently _single-node_ clusters.

[#upgrading-multi-node-clusters]
== Upgrading Multi-Node Clusters

The procedures for upgrading multi-node clusters are presented as follows:

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc[Upgrade an Offline Cluster].
This is the simplest procedure for the upgrade of a multi-node cluster.
Note, however, that it requires cluster-downtime.

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online.adoc[Upgrade an Online Cluster].
This allows the cluster to continue serving data, for the duration of the upgrade.
Two options are provided:

** xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc[Upgrade a Reduced-Capacity, Online Cluster].
If no additional nodes are available to facilitate the upgrade-procedure, the procedure can be completed with the existing cluster-nodes, provided that it is acceptable for the cluster to serve data, during the upgrade, at reduced capacity.

** xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-full-capacity.adoc[Upgrade a Full-Capacity, Online Cluster].
If additional nodes are available to facilitate the upgrade-procedure, the procedure can be completed with the cluster continuing to serve data at full capacity.

* xref:install:upgrade-ipv6-cluster.adoc[Upgrade an IPv6 Cluster].
Special instructions are provided for the upgrade of IPv6 clusters.

[#upgrading-developer-clusters]
== Upgrading Developer Clusters

Clusters are frequently established for development purposes.
When these are _multi-node_, the upgrade procedures listed above, in xref:install:upgrade-procedures.adoc#upgrading-multi-node-clusters[Upgrading Multi-Node Clusters], can be followed.

However, clusters established for development purposes are frequently _single-node_ clusters.
Single-node clusters are _unsupported_: nevertheless, they can be upgraded by following subsets of the instructions provided for multi-node clusters; as described below.
Before following these procedures, developers should become familiar with the xref:install:upgrade.adoc#supported-upgrade-paths[Upgrade Paths]; and, if appropriate, with the information provided in xref:install:upgrade-to-ipv6.adoc[Upgrade an IPv6 Cluster].

Note, however, that since offline upgrade for Windows is no longer supported in 7.2, no procedure is available for the upgrade of a single-node Windows cluster.
(Install, uninstall, and repair for Windows continue to be supported in 7.2.)

[#upgrading-linux-and-windows-based-single-node-clusters]
=== Upgrading Linux- and Windows-Based Single-Node Clusters

The cluster should be taken _offline_ (such that no application access is possible) for the duration of the upgrade process.
Therefore, the step-by-step procedure provided in xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc[Upgrade an Offline Cluster] can be followed.
Note that when following the steps in the stage named xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#upgrade-each-individual-node[Upgrade Each Individual Node], the final step can be omitted (since only one node needs to be upgraded).

[#upgrading-macos-based-single-node-clusters]
=== Upgrading MacOS-Based Clusters

Command-line expressions for _upgrade_ are not supported for MacOS: therefore, a MacOS-based cluster must be upgraded by means of _install_ command-line expressions.
As with Linux- and Windows-based single-node clusters, a MacOS-based single-node cluster should remain offline for the duration of the upgrade process.

Therefore, to upgrade a MacOS-based single-node cluster, proceed as follows:

. Follow the instructions provided for offline multi-node clusters, in xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#prepare-the-cluster[Stage One: Prepare the Cluster] (which is part of the procedure xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc[Upgrade an Offline Cluster]).

. Follow the instructions provided for online multi-node clusters, in xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc#upgrade-the-removed-node[Stage Three: Upgrade the Removed Node] (which is part of the procedure xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc[Upgrade a Reduced-Capacity, Online Cluster]).

. Follow the instructions provided for offline multi-node clusters, in xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#bring-the-cluster-back-online[Stage Three: Bring the Cluster Back Online] (which is part of the procedure xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc[Upgrade an Offline Cluster]).

This concludes the upgrade procedure.
