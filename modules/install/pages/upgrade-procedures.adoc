{description}

The pages in this section each provide step-by-step instructions for the upgrade of a Couchbase-Server cluster.
Each procedure addresses a specific context and its associated dependencies: for information on how to select the appropriate procedure, see the upgrade overview-information provided in xref:install:upgrade-strategies.adoc[Upgrade Options].

The procedures are presented as follows:

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc[Upgrade Cluster Online, with Reduced Capacity].
If additional nodes are not available, the procedure can be completed with no more than the existing cluster-nodes, provided that the cluster can function, during the upgrade, at reduced capacity.
