{description}

The pages in this section each provide step-by-step instructions for the upgrade of a Couchbase-Server cluster.
Each procedure addresses a specific context and its associated dependencies: for information on how to select the appropriate procedure, see the information provided in xref:install:upgrade-strategies.adoc[Upgrade Procedure-Selection].

To perform any of these procedures, the administrator must have the *Full Admin* or the *Cluster Admin* role.
For information, see xref:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].

Note that information specific to the upgrade of IPv6 clusters is provided in xref:install:upgrade-to-ipv6.adoc[Upgrade IPv6 Clusters].

The procedures are presented as follows:

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-reduced-capacity.adoc[Upgrade Cluster Online, with Reduced Capacity].
If additional nodes are not available, the procedure can be completed with no more than the existing cluster-nodes, provided that the cluster can function, during the upgrade, at reduced capacity.

* xref:install:upgrade-cluster-online-full-capacity.adoc[Upgrade Cluster Online, with Full Capacity].
If additional nodes are available, the procedure can be completed with the cluster continuing to serve data at full capacity.
