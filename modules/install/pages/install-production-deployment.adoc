.Couchbase Server Deployment Guidelines
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Guideline | Description

| *Sizing*
| Evaluate the overall performance and capacity requirements of your deployment, and determine the hardware and other resources.

xref:sizing-general.adoc[Sizing Guidelines]

xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services]

| *Time keeping*
| Keeping accurate time is essential to a properly-functioning database.
Ensure that you follow the guidelines for synchronizing each Couchbase node using Network Time Protocol (NTP).

xref:synchronize-clocks-using-ntp.adoc[Clock Sync with NTP]

| *Disable Transparent Huge Pages*
| You must disable the THP memory management system on each node that runs Couchbase Server.

xref:thp-disable.adoc[Disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)]

| *Set kernel swappiness*
| The [.term]_kernel swappiness_ setting defines how aggressively the kernel will swap memory pages versus dropping pages from the page cache.
You need to set the swappiness setting to 0, or at most 1, for optimal Couchbase Server operation.

xref:install-swap-space.adoc[Swap Space and Kernel Swappiness]

| *Couchbase client deployment*
| When you deploy Couchbase Server, you need to plan how clients will access and interact with the cluster.

xref:install-client-server.adoc[Couchbase Client Deployment Strategies]

| *Security*
| Couchbase Server provides security features that allow administrators to implement various security controls to ensure secure deployment.
You should take Couchbase security best practices into consideration before, during, and after deployment.

xref:install:server-processes.adoc[Couchbase Server Processes]

| *Virtualized and containerized deployments*
| Certain considerations must be made when you're deploying Couchbase Server on a virtual machine or container.

xref:best-practices-vm.adoc[Deployment Considerations for Virtual Machines and Containers]

| *Clusters with less than three nodes*
| Couchbase Server clusters with less than three nodes are not recommended in production.
However, you might find a need to have a smaller deployment for test and development purposes.
