= Installing Multiple Instances on Linux Platforms
:description: Multiple instances of Couchbase Server can be installed on one physical machine for the Linux operating system.

[abstract]
{description}

IMPORTANT: This installation method is intended for development purposes only and not supported in production.

The number of Couchbase Server instances running on a single machine depends on its physical capacity.

== Requirements

Make sure that a minimum of 4Gb RAM and 8 Core CPUs are available for each Couchbase Server instance.
When installing multiple instances on a physical machine, install as one of these two users:

* sudo user
* non-root, non-sudo user

NOTE: Refer to the lists of the reserved Couchbase Server network ports and user-defined ports before creating any new user-defined ports.

NOTE: The number of Couchbase Servers that can be installed on a physical machine depends on the available RAM and CPU capacities.

== Setting up Multiple Instances

To set up multiple instances running on a physical machine:

. Install Couchbase Server as a sudo user or as a non-root, non-sudo user.
See xref:install:non-root.adoc[Non-Root Install and Upgrade], for instructions on non-root install.

. Create user-defined ports in the file [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_.
. In the [.path]_/etc/security/limits.conf_ file, make sure that the hard and soft limits for the `nofile` parameter are set to a value greater than 10240.
. Change the `short_name` parameter that identifies the instance (default: ns_1), to a different `short_name` in the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ file.
 ** The `short_name` value must be different for each instance that resides on the same physical server.
. Change the two occurrences of `short_name` in the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-server_ file.
For example, use the `sed` utility.
 ** {empty}

----
sed -i ‘s/ns_1/ns_inst1/g’ bin/couchbase-server
----
. Start the Couchbase Server instance.
. Repeat the steps to install other instances.

IMPORTANT: While creating a cluster,  make sure that the `perServer` RAM quota is calculated looking at the number of instances to be installed on that machine.
When configuring a cluster instance, Couchbase Server provides a default value for the perServer RAM quota.
This default value is based on the total RAM quota available on the physical machine.
Modify this value as needed.

== Troubleshooting

If any bucket created on the nodes appear to be in a pending state, or if rebalance fails with an error

....
not_all_nodes_are_ready_yet
....

there could be a mismatch of the `short_name` value in the following files:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-server
/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config
----

== Limitations

Following are some of the limitations for running multiple instance of Couchbase Server on a single machine:

* Some of the Couchbase Server tools will be unavailable to run on the customized ports for multiple Couchbase instances:
 ** [.cmd]`cbrecovery`
 ** [.cmd]`cbworkloadgen`
* Offline upgrade for multiple instances is unavailable.
* If a bucket is created on a dedicated port, some of the operations can result in the error `could not listen on port xxx`, even though the operation still succeeds.
This error is logged regardless of the port that is used.
