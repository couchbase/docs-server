= Single node upgrade

[abstract]
To upgrade a single Couchbase Server node, first back up your data and then install the upgrade software package.

Use the xref:cli:cbbackup-tool.adoc#cbbackup-tool[cbbackup tool] to back up your data.

NOTE: Steps for upgrading a Couchbase Server node explained in this section are identical for an online upgrade (for a node that has been removed from the cluster) or an offline upgrade (for a node that has not yet been added to the cluster).

. Download the Couchbase Server package.
. Back up the cluster data.
. Back up the server-specific configuration files.
While the upgrade scripts perform a backup of the configuration and data files, make your own backup of these files as best practice.
The configuration files are found in [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/ _by default.
. Stop the Couchbase Server service.
. Check your hostname configuration.
If you have deployed Couchbase Server in a cloud service, or if you are using hostnames rather than IP addresses, you must verify that the hostname has been configured correctly and is resolvable before performing the upgrade.
. Perform the upgrade installation for your platform; see the xref:installation.adoc#topic_o2n_51k_5s[Installing Couchbase Server]section appropriate for your platform for detailed installation instructions.
