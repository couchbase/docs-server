{description}

Use the instructions on this page to install Couchbase Server on macOS platforms using Couchbase-provided application packages.
The instructions support both Enterprise and Community https://www.couchbase.com/products/editions[editions^].

If you're upgrading an existing installation of Couchbase Server, refer to xref:upgrade.adoc[Upgrading Couchbase Server].

== Before You Install

Couchbase Server works out-of-the-box with most OS configurations.
However, the procedures on this page assume the following:

* Your system meets the xref:pre-install.adoc[minimum requirements] and that your operating system version is xref:install-platforms.adoc[supported].
* You're working from a clean system and that you've xref:install-uninstalling.adoc[uninstalled] any previous versions of Couchbase Server.
+
If you're upgrading an existing installation of Couchbase Server, refer to xref:upgrade.adoc[Upgrading Couchbase Server].

Although macOS is not supported for production deployments, you should still review the xref:install-production-deployment.adoc[deployment guidelines] for more information about best practices.

== Basic Installation

. Download the appropriate package from the Couchbase https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[downloads page^].
+
Couchbase Server for macOS is packaged as a standalone application in a compressed disk image.

. Mount the the downloaded `.dmg` file.
+
Locate the downloaded Couchbase Server `.dmg` file (typically located in the default `~/Downloads` folder) and double-click it.
Opening the file will automatically mount a volume in Finder containing the `Couchbase Server.app` application file.
+

//Removed this statement since it seems a little over-the-top for development systems that can easily be re-installed.
[NOTE]
====
Be sure to use `Archive Utility.app`, the default archive file handler in macOS, to unpack the Couchbase Server ZIP file.
(You only have to worry about this if you've changed the default archive utility on your Mac.)
It is more difficult to diagnose non-functioning or damaged installations when using other archive extraction tools.
====
////
. Drag-and-drop the `Couchbase Server.app` file into the system `/Applications` folder.
+
[NOTE]
====
macOS has a security policy that requires downloaded software to be run directly from the `/Applications` folder.
Attempting to open `Couchbase Server.app` from any other folder or sub-folder will result in a "Problem Running Couchbase" error.

==== 

. Double-click `Couchbase Server.app` to start Couchbase Server.
+
A macOS Gatekeeper https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491[dialogue^] will appear asking if you want to open `Couchbase Server.app`.
Click [.ui]*Open* to continue.
+
Couchbase Server runs as a background application.
When Couchbase Server starts, the Couchbase Server icon image:macos-menu-bar-icon-light.png[Couchbase Server menu bar icon,20] will appear in the menu bar.

. Open a web browser and access the Couchbase Web Console to xref:testing.adoc[verify] that the installation was successful and the node is available.
+
You can open the Couchbase Web Console by clicking image:macos-menu-bar-icon-light.png[Couchbase Server menu bar icon,20] and then selecting *Open Admin Console*.

Although the Couchbase Server software resides in the `/Applications` folder, the Couchbase data files are stored in other folders.
For more information, refer to xref:install-uninstalling.adoc[Uninstalling Couchbase Server].

=== Terminal-based Installation

As an alternative to the UI-based installation, you can install Couchbase Server using the Terminal.

. Copy the `Couchbase Server.app` file into the system `/Applications` folder.
+
[source,console,subs=+quotes]
----
cp -R /Volumes/[.var]_volume-name_/Couchbase\ Server.app /Applications

For more information, refer to xref:install-uninstalling.adoc[Uninstalling Couchbase Server].

== Accessing the CLI Tools

On macOS, the Couchbase Server command line interface (CLI) tools are included in the `Couchbase Server.app` application directory:
----
/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin
----
To browse the commands in Finder, right-click on `Couchbase Server.app`, select *Show Package Contents*, and then go to `/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin`.

== Next Steps

Following installation and start-up of Couchbase Server, a node must be _initialized_ and _provisioned_.

* If it is the first node in a deployment, initialization and provisioning happens all at once when you create a _cluster of one_.
+
Refer to xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[Create a Cluster]

* If you already have an existing cluster, the node is initialized and provisioned when you add it to the cluster.
+
Refer to xref:manage:manage-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node and Rebalance]
+
* Optionally, initialization can be performed explicitly and independently of provisioning, as a prior process, in order to establish certain configurations, such as custom disk-paths.
+
