= Using user-defined ports

[abstract]
You can install and run Couchbase Server with user-defined ports rather than with the default ports.

To run Couchbase server on user-defined ports, make sure that the minimum RAM and CPU are available for the Couchbase instance.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run Couchbase Server on user-defined ports and with multiple instances running on a single machine, you have to keep in mind that the standard RPM installation for Linux doesnâ€™t allow you to specify separate installation paths needed for separate multiple instances.
Therefore, you must perform multiple non-root (sudo or non-sudo) installations instead.

== Setting up Couchbase Server with user-defined ports

. Install Couchbase Server
 ** If Couchbase Server is already installed and running, stop it.
. Add the new user-defined ports to the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ file.
 ** The [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ is the location from where the Couchbase Server picks up the configuration parameters.
 ** If port numbers are not specified, default ports are used.
 ** To override some or all default ports, append the user-defined ports to the file.
. (Optional) CAPI port (default 8092) can be edited in the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/default.d/capi.ini_ file by replacing 8092 with the new port name.
. If the Couchbase Server was previously configured, delete the [.path]_opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat_ file to remove the old configuration.
. Start Couchbase Server.

== Ports to change

The following are the user-defined ports to add, replace, or append to the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ file.

{rest_port, 9000}.                                   
{mccouch_port, 8999}.                         
{memcached_port, 12000}.
{memcached_dedicated_port, 11999}.
{moxi_port, 12001}.
{short_name, "ns_1"}.
{ssl_rest_port,11000}.                       
{ssl_capi_port,11001}.
{ssl_proxy_downstream_port,11002}.
{ssl_proxy_upstream_port,11003}.
----

NOTE: If the newly configured ports overlap with ports used by other running applications, Couchbase Server fails to start.
If the newly configured ports overlap with ports used by Couchbase buckets, Erlang crash notifications appear in the log file.

NOTE: In order to set up multiple nodes per machine, you need to assign unique values to these ports.
