= Testing with [.cmd]`telnet`

[abstract]
The simplest method to determine whether Couchbase Server is running is to use [.cmd]`Telnet` to connect to the server with the memcached text protocol.

[.cmd]`Telnet` must be installed on your server to connect to Couchbase Server using this method.
It is supplied as standard on most platforms, or can be obtained as a separate package and installed via your operating system's standard package manager.

NOTE: You do not need to use the [.cmd]`Telnet` method for communicating with your server within your application.
Instead, use one of the Couchbase Server SDKs.

Connect to the server (connecting to the legacy memcached protocol using Moxi):

----
> telnet localhost1 11211
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
Escape character is '^]'.
----

Make sure it is responding (stats is a great way to check basic health):

----
stats
STAT delete_misses 0
STAT ep_io_num_write 0
STAT rejected_conns 0
...
STAT time 1286678223
...
STAT curr_items_tot 0
...
STAT threads 4
STAT pid 23871
...
END
----

Put a key in:

----
set test_key 0 0 1
a
STORED
----

Retrieve the key:

----
get test_key
VALUE test_key 0 1
a
END
----

Disconnect:

----
quit
Connection closed by foreign host.
>
----

All of the memcached protocols commands will work through [.cmd]`Telnet`.
