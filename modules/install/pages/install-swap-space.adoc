= Swap Space and Kernel Swappiness

For optimal Couchbase Server performance on most Linux systems, you should set swappiness to 0.

Couchbase Server efficiently uses available RAM for your working set data; ideally, sufficient RAM remains available to the operating system above and beyond your cluster’s configured server RAM quota.
It's always a good idea to configure a reasonable amount of virtual memory or swap space on Linux-based nodes. (There are no recommended virtual memory optimizations for Windows-based nodes.)
Sufficient virtual memory helps prevent Couchbase Server processes from being killed by the OS, such as by the Linux out of memory (OOM) killer.

The Linux kernel's _swappiness_ setting defines how aggressively the kernel will swap memory pages versus dropping pages from the page cache.
A higher value increases swap aggressiveness, while a lower value tells the kernel to swap as little as possible to disk and favor RAM.
The swappiness range is from 0 to 100, and most Linux distributions have swappiness set to 60 by default.

Couchbase Server is optimized with its managed cache to use RAM, and is capable of managing what should be in RAM and what shouldn't be.
Allowing the OS to have too much control over what memory pages are in RAM is likely to lower Couchbase Server’s performance.
Therefore, it is recommended that you set swappiness  to zero.



== Changing Swappiness Setting

The Linux kernel's swappiness setting tells the virtual memory subsystem how much it should attempt to swap to disk.
Linux operating systems often default to a setting of 60, which can cause the OS to swap out items from memory even when there is plenty of RAM available.
This behavior is undesirable given Couchbase Server's memory-first architecture.

. Verify your current system's swappiness setting.
+
[source,console]
----
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
----
+
Proceed to the next step if the output isn't zero.

. Change the swappiness setting.
+
.. Set the value for the running system.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness'
----
+
.. Backup `sysctl.conf`.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo cp -p /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.conf.`date +%Y%m%d-%H:%M`
----
+
.. Set the value in `/etc/sysctl.conf` so it stays after reboot.
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sh -c 'echo "" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
----
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sh -c 'echo "#Set swappiness to 0 to minimize swapping" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'
----
+
[source,console]
----
sudo sh -c 'echo "vm.swappiness = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf'

Setting swappiness needs to be a part of the build process for any new Couchbase node.
Make sure to modify any continuous deployment process that builds the OS.
This also applies to golden master OS images and configuration automation systems.
It is especially critical for public/private clouds where it is easy to bring up new instances.

// <p>To change the swappiness configuration:</p>
// <ol>
// <li>Execute <codeblock>cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness </codeblock>on each node to determine the
// current swappiness configuration.</li>
// <li>Execute <codeblock>sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=0</codeblock>to change the swap configuration
// immediately.</li>
// <li>To ensure that this setting persists through the server restarts: <ol>
// <li>Use <codeph>sudo</codeph> or <codeph>root</codeph> user privileges to edit the kernel
// parameters configuration file <filepath>/etc/sysctl.conf</filepath>, so that the change is
// always in effect.</li>
// <li>Append the following to the file:<codeblock>vm.swappiness = 0</codeblock></li>
// <li>Reboot your system.</li>
// </ol></li>
// </ol>
