[abstract]
Install Couchbase Server on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).
Root and non-root installations are supported.

Use the instructions on this page to install Couchbase Server on SLES using the officially-supported `.rpm` packages provided by Couchbase.
The instructions support both Enterprise and Community editions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation procedures assume that you're working from a clean system and that you've xref:install-uninstalling.adoc[uninstalled] any previous installations of Couchbase Server.

If you're upgrading an existing installation of Couchbase Server, refer to xref:upgrade.adoc[Upgrading Couchbase Server].
====

== Before You Install

Couchbase Server works out-of-the-box on most SLES configurations.
However, you should review the following material before installing, especially if you're deploying Couchbase into production:

* Ensure that you've met the xref:plan-for-production.adoc[minimum system requirements] and that your operating system version is xref:install-platforms.adoc[supported].
* Follow the xref:install-production-deployment.adoc[deployment guidelines] to ensure that your systems and environment are properly sized and configured.

== Basic Installation

You must be logged in as root (superuser) or use `sudo` to run the installation commands.

=== Install Using YaST

The SUSE package manager (`yast`) provides the simplest and most comprehensive way to install Couchbase on SUSE platforms.
This method involves downloading and installing a small meta package from Couchbase, which `yast` can then use to automatically download and install Couchbase Server and all of its dependencies.

. Download and install the `.rpm` meta package.
+
[source,console]
----
curl -O https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-6-x86_64.rpm
----
+
[source,console]
----
sudo rpm -i ./couchbase-release-1.0-6-x86_64.rpm
----
+
The meta package installs the necessary information for `yast` to retrieve all of the necessary packages.

. Install Couchbase Server.
