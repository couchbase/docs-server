== Understanding Feature Availability

The process of upgrading a cluster involves upgrading each node individually, from a lower version of Couchbase Server to a higher.
Node-upgrades occur sequentially.
Consequently, during the overall cluster-upgrade process, the cluster runs in _mixed mode_; meaning that some nodes are running the lower version, and others the higher.

Since a higher version of Couchbase Server always introduces features not provided by a lower, such features should not be used during the upgrade process, unless such use is explicitly supported in mixed-mode conditions.
When cluster-upgrade is complete, all the features of the higher version of Couchbase Server can be used.

The following table summarizes the new features in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition Version 7.0, and indicates whether or not they can be used in the mixed-mode conditions that exist during the cluster-upgrade process.
_Usable in Mixed Mode_ indicates that the feature can be used as long as one node is running the higher version.
_Not Usable in Mixed Mode_ indicates that cluster-upgrade must be fully completed, before the feature can be used.
