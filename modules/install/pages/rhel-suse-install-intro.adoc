= Red Hat and CentOS Installation

[abstract]
Couchbase Server supports Red Hat (RHEL) and RHEL-based operating systems such as CentOS.

Before you start with the installation, ensure that dependency checking tool [.cmd]`pkgconfig` is installed.
The Couchbase Server package requires this package to verify certain package dependencies have been met.

== Check OpenSSL Dependency

The Couchbase Server RPM performs dependency checks using `pkgconfig` for RHEL.
Verify that `pkgconfig` is installed, and install it if necessary:

----
sudo yum install -y pkgconfig
----

Upon successful installation, the following output appears:

----
Loaded plugins .... Installed: pkgconfig.x86_64 1:0.21-2.el5 Complete!
----

IMPORTANT: Please ensure that you are running OpenSSL v1.0.1g or higher.
On Monday, April 7th, 2014, an OpenSSL vulnerability was disclosed which has been called one of the worst security holes in recent internet history.
The bug, called the Heartbleed bug, was introduced in OpenSSL version 1.0.1.
It has been in the wild since March of 2012 and is patched with OpenSSL version 1.0.1g released on April 7th, 2014.
The problem, tagged CVE-2014-0160, is described in detail in this https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160[NIST article].

For CentOS systems, you can query the version of the OpenSSL package installed on your system by typing:

----
 rpm -q -a | grep "openssl"
----

You should receive output that looks like this:

----
 openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5.7.x86_64
----

If you are on one of the supported distros, ensure that your OpenSSL version is up-to-date.
If your distribution is not supported anymore, it is highly recommended that you transition to a supported operating system due to this bug's severity.
