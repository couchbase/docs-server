= Installing as non-root, non-sudo

[abstract]
Installing on RHEL as a non-root, non-sudo user on a single machine.

IMPORTANT: This installation method is intended only for development purposes and is not supported in production.

A non-sudo, non-root installation still runs Couchbase Server and all Couchbase command-line tools.

. After downloading the Couchbase Server RPM, go to the directory where it is located and extract it:
+
----
rpm2cpio couchbase-server-enterprise_version.rpm 
| cpio --extract --make-directories --no-absolute-filenames
----
+
In the directory where the files were extracted, the `opt` and `etc` subdirectories are available.

. If you need to separately provide `openssl098e`, put the contents of this library into [.path]_/opt/couchbase/lib_:
 ** Download `openssl098e-0.9.8e-17.el6.centos.2.x86_64.rpm`.
 ** Go to the directory where you extracted the Couchbase Server:
+
----
cd opt/couchbase.
----

 ** Extract `openssl098e` RPM:
+
----
rpm2cpio openssl098e-0.9.8e-17.el6.centos.2.x86_64.rpm 
| cpio --extract --make-directories --no-absolute-filenames
----

 ** Move the extracted files to the [.path]_/lib_ directory for Couchbase Server:
+
----
 mv /usr/lib64/* lib/
----
. After you extract the Couchbase Server installation files, go to the subdirectory:

----
cd opt/couchbase
----

. Run the following script to relocate the Couchbase Server installation to the present working directory (PWD):

----
 ./bin/install/reloc.sh `pwd`
----

This enables you to continue the installation as a non-root, non-sudo user.

. To run the server, use

----
 ./bin/couchbase-server \-- -noinput -detached
----

. To stop the server, use

----
./bin/couchbase-server -k
----
