= Deploy a Multi-Node Cluster with ARM

[abstract]
With the new Azure Resource Manager (ARM), you can deploy a multi-node Couchbase Server cluster to Azure cloud.

Deploying a multi-node Couchbase Server cluster for the first time on many of the public cloud platforms could require a long array of operations that must be followed carefully.

With the new Azure Resource Manager (ARM), you can deploy a multi-node Couchbase Server cluster with a simple but powerful template.

http://www.fullscale180.com/[Full Scale 180^] worked with Microsoft to develop some of the templates for deploying close to real life examples of common solutions in the market.
Those templates can be found at https://github.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/[github.com^].

The https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/couchbase-on-ubuntu[Couchbase Server cluster template^] is one of the templates.
It allows Azure users to deploy clusters, using different VM sizes, implementing Azure and Couchbase Server best practices.
