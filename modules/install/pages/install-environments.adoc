[abstract]
Depending on your local configuration, some components of Couchbase Server may have additional system requirements.

== Java Runtime Environment (JRE) — Analytics Service Only

The Analytics service requires a Java Runtime Environment to be installed.
The Oracle JRE version 8 is installed by default when you install Couchbase Server — you do not need to install any additional prerequisites to use the Analytics service.
Starting with version 6.0.1, Oracle Java JRE version 8 has been replaced by *OpenJDK version 11*.
However, if necessary, you can specify an alternative JRE for the Analytics service when you xref:init-setup.adoc[initialize a cluster].
If you plan to use an alternative JRE for the Analytics service, note that the following versions are supported.
