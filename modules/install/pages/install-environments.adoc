== Java Runtime Environment (JRE) — Analytics Service Only

The Analytics Service requires a Java Runtime Environment to be installed. Only https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/[HotSpot-based JVMs], which includes the ones provided by OpenJDK and Oracle's JDK, are supported.

OpenJDK 11 is installed when you install Couchbase Server — you do not need to install any additional prerequisites to use the Analytics service.

However, if necessary, you can specify an alternative JRE for the Analytics Service when you xref:manage:manage-nodes/create-cluster.adoc[initialize a node].
If you plan to use an alternative JRE for the Analytics service, note that the following versions are supported.
