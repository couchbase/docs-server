[abstract]
Depending on your local configuration, some components of Couchbase Server have additional system requirements.

== Java Runtime Environment (JRE) — Analytics Service Only

The Analytics service requires a Java Runtime Environment to be installed.
The Oracle JRE version 8 is bundled with Couchbase Server, and is installed when you install Couchbase Server.
You do not have to install any additional prerequisites to use the Analytics service.
However, if required, you can specify a different JRE for the Analytics service when you xref:init-setup.adoc[initialize a cluster].
If you plan to use a different JRE for the Analytics service, note that the following versions are supported.
