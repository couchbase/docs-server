= Upgrade an Offline, Multi-Node Cluster

:description: A multi-node cluster can most simply be upgraded when entirely offline; meaning that it is not serving data.

== Understanding Offline Cluster-Upgrade

Offline cluster-upgrade can occur when the cluster is not required to serve data for some period of time.
All application-access to the cluster is stopped, and each node in turn is upgraded.
Then, the cluster is brought back online, and application-access to it is restored.
The page provides step-by-step instructions for upgrading an offline _multi-node_ cluster.

== Perform an Offline, Multi-Node Cluster-Upgrade

The procedure is presented in three stages; which are xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#prepare-the-cluster[Prepare the Cluster], xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#upgrade-each-individual-node[Upgrade Each Individual Node], and xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#bring-the-cluster-back-online[Bring the Cluster Back Online].

[#prepare-the-cluster]
=== Stage One: Prepare the Cluster

. Stop all applications that access the cluster.
Monitor the _disk-write queue_ on each node, to ensure that all data has been persisted to disk.
A command of the following form can be used:
+
----
curl -s -u '${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}' ${NODE_HOSTNAME}:${NODE_MANGEMENT_PORT}/pools/default/buckets/${BUCKET}/stats | jq ".op.samples.disk_write_queue[-1]"
----
+
When this command returns `0`, all data has been persisted to disk.

. Back up the cluster's user-data.
Backup can be performed either with xref:backup-restore:enterprise-backup-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr] or with the xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/backup-service.adoc[Backup Service]; and should be a _full_ (rather than an incremental) backup.
+
For example, to use `cbbackupmgr` to configure an archive and repository for the backup, a command of the following form should be entered:
+
[source,bash]
----
cbbackupmgr config --archive ${ABS_PATH_TO_ARCHIVE} --repo ${REPO_NAME}
----
+
Here, `ABS_PATH_TO_ARCHIVE` is an absolute path to a filesystem location that will serve as the archive within which the backed up data will reside.
The `REPO_NAME` is the name of the repository that will be associated with the location.
+
Once the archive and repository have been created, a command such as the following performs a full backup:
+
[source,bash]
----
cbbackupmgr backup --archive ${ABS_PATH_TO_ARCHIVE} --repo ${REPO_NAME} --cluster ${CLUSTER_ADDRESS} --username ${USERNAME} --password ${PASSWORD} --full-backup
----
+
Here, the `CLUSTER_ADDRESS` is the IP address or domain name of the cluster.
The `full-backup` flag ensures that the backup is indeed a _full_ backup.
+
For the equivalent procedure as performed by the Backup Service, see xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#run-an-immediate-backup[Run an Immediate Backup].
+
In the event of node-upgrade failing, the backed-up data can be restored by means of xref:backup-restore:cbbackupmgr-restore.adoc[cbbackupmgr restore] or xref:cli:cbtools/cbrecovery.adoc[cbrecovery]; or by means of the Backup Service (see xref:manage:manage-backup-and-restore/manage-backup-and-restore.adoc#restore-backups[Restore Backups]).

. Disable auto-failover (to prevent auto-failover from occuring when individual nodes stop communicating with the rest of the cluster, during their upgrade).
Disablement is performed by means of the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc[General Settings] screen, by means of the xref:manage:manage-settings/general-settings.adoc#node-availability[Node Availability] panel.
This needs to be done only once, on one node.
+
For example, enter a command of the following form:
+
----
couchbase-cli setting-autofailover -c ${NODE_HOSTNAME} -u ${USERNAME} -p ${PASSWORD} --enable-auto-failover 0
----

[#upgrade-each-individual-node]
=== Stage Two: Upgrade each Individual Node

Each individual node must now be upgraded in turn.
Therefore, for each node, proceed as follows:

. Stop the `couchbase-server.service` service, on the first node that is to be upgraded.
Enter the following command:
+
----
systemctl stop couchbase-server.service
----
+
This _stops_ the service; and so allows it to be restarted after reboot.
Note that, optionally, at this point, the service can also be _disabled_; which prevents it from restarting after reboot.
This may be useful if additional tasks, such as OS upgrade, need to be performed.
If such disabling is desired, enter the following command:
+
----
systemctl disable --now couchbase-server.service
----
+
Note that to disable and/or stop Couchbase Server Community Edition, in these commands, `couchbase-server-community` should be substituted for `couchbase-server`.

. Manually back up the node's configuration files.
These files reside in `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config`.
It is recommended that the path to the backup-location for these files contain the node's domain name or IP address, to ensure accurate recovery.
It is also recommended that the backup-location be on a separate machine.
+
Enter a command such as the following;
+
----
cp -r /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config ${PATH_TO_A_SAFE_LOCATION}/${NODE_IP}_config_files
----

. If using Couchbase-provided repositories/PPAs, the Couchbase-Server version should be _unpinned_, to allow it to be upgraded.
Proceed as follows, for the appropriate platform:
+
[{tabs}]
====
RedHat & Centos::
+
--

Move the reference to the `couchbase-server` (or `couchbase-server-community`, if using Community Edition) package to the `exclude` section of the `yum.conf` file, located in `/etc/yum/yum.conf`.

--

Ubuntu & Debian::
+
--

Run the following command (specifying, if using Community Edition, `couchbase-server-community`, rather than `couchbase-server`):

----
apt-mark unhold couchbase-server
----

--
====

. Upgrade the Couchbase Server package, using the package manager from the distribution currently running on the cluster.
+
If using a Couchbase-provided `yum` repository, enter the following:
+
----
yum update couchbase-server
----
+
If Using a Couchbase-provided PPA, enter the following:
+
----
apt --only-upgrade install couchbase-server
----
+
If using a downloaded package-archive, enter the command appropriate for the platform, as follows:
+
[{tabs}]
====
RedHat & Centos::
+
--
----
yum install ${PATH_TO_RPM_PACKAGE}
----
--

Ubuntu & Debian::
+
--
----
dpkg -i ${PATH_TO_DEB_PACKAGE}
----
--
====

. Enable and start the `couchbase-server` (or `couchbase-server-community`) service.
(The package installer may already have performed enablement: however, explicit enablement is nevertheless recommended.)
+
Enter the following commands (substituting, if using Community Edition, `couchbase-server-community` for `couchbase-server`).
+
----
systemctl enable couchbase-server.service

systemctl is-active --quiet couchbase-server.service || systemctl start couchbase-server.service
----

. _Repin_ (or _hold_) future package-upgrades for Couchbase Server, so that none occurs before the administrator's next, elective, manually driven upgrade.
Proceed as follows for the appropriate platform:
+
[{tabs}]
====
RedHat & Centos::
+
--
Add the `couchbase-server` (or `couchbase-server-community`) package to the `exclude` section of `/etc/yum/yum.conf`.
The line appears as follows:

----
exclude=couchbase-server
----
--

Ubuntu & Debian::
+
--
Run the following command (substituting, if running Community Edition, `couchbase-server-community` for `couchbase-server`):

----
apt-mark hold couchbase-server
----

--
====

. Repeat all prior steps in this section, xref:install:upgrade-cluster-offline.adoc#upgrade-each-individual-node[Upgrade Each Individual Node], for every other node in the cluster.

[#bring-the-cluster-back-online]
=== Stage Three: Bring the Cluster Back Online

Proceed as follows:

. Wait for the completion of _warmup_, for all _Couchbase_ buckets.
Note that this may take some time, if the buckets contain large amounts of data.
+
The status of warmup can be checked for each node as follows:
+
----
cbstats ${NODE_ADDRESS}:${NODE_KV_PORT} -u ${USERNAME} -p ${PASSWORD} -b ${BUCKET} warmup | grep state
----
+
For example:
+
----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats localhost:11210 -u Administrator -p password -b travel-sample warmup | grep state
----
+
When warmup is complete, the command returns the following:
+
----
ep_warmup_state:                 done
----
+
Note that _Ephemeral_ buckets do not require warmup.
If an Ephemeral bucket is specified in this command, an error is returned.

. Following warmup, bring the cluster back online, restarting applications.

This concludes the upgrade process for the offline, multi-node cluster.
