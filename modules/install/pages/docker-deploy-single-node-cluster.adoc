= Deploying a Single Node Cluster with Docker

[abstract]
To run a single node cluster, you need to deploy a single Couchbase Server container representing the single node.

For deployments with Couchbase Server containers, use the Couchbase Docker images available on https://hub.docker.com/_/couchbase/[Docker Hub].

NOTE: Before you begin, review the container requirements section for prerequisites and resource requirements for the containers.

. Start the Couchbase Server container, db, using the following command:
+
----
docker run -d --name db -p 8091-8096:8091-8096 -p 11210-11211:11210-11211 couchbase
----
+
This command downloads and runs the container tagged "latest" from the Couchbase repo on Docker Hub.
+
Check the Docker logs to verify that the container has started:
+
----
docker logs db
----
+
If the container is started, it should return the following output:
+
----
Starting Couchbase Server -- Web UI available at http://<ip>:8091
----
+
NOTE: If Couchbase Server is running locally on the machine without containers, the port mappings specified using the `-p` option may fail.
Ensure that you stop your local instance of Couchbase Server before running the above command.

. From the browser, access the Web Console using [.path]_\http://localhost:8091_.
If the container is up and running, you should see the Couchbase Server Setup Screen.

. Set up Couchbase Server.
Walk through the Setup wizard and accept default values.
+
You may need to lower the RAM allocated to various services to fit within the bounds of the resource for the containers.
Enable the `travel-sample` and `beer-sample` buckets to load some sample data.

This is all that is needed for a single node deployment of Couchbase Server.
If you want to add nodes to your cluster, see xref:docker-deploy-multi-node-cluster.adoc[Deploying a Multi-node Cluster with Docker].

== Running a N1QL Query

Open the Web Console at [.path]_\http://localhost:8091_ and switch to the Query tab.
Run the following N1QL query:

----
SELECT name FROM `beer-sample` WHERE  brewery_id ="mishawaka_brewing";
----

To run a query from command line query tool:

. Run the interactive shell on the container:
+
----
bash -c "clear && docker exec -it db sh"
----

. Navigate to the [.path]_bin_ directory:
+
----
# cd /opt/couchbase/bin
----

. Run the [.cmd]`cbq` command line tool:
+
----
# ./cbq
----

. Execute a N1QL query on the `beer-sample` bucket:
+
----
cbq> SELECT name FROM `beer-sample` WHERE  brewery_id ="mishawaka_brewing";
----

For more query samples, see xref:getting-started:first-n1ql-query.adoc[Running Your First N1QL Query].

== Connect via SDK

Simply run your application through the Couchbase Server SDKs on the host and point it to [.path]_\http://localhost:8091/pools_ to connect to the container.

For information on deploying a sample application to a container, see xref:java-sdk:common:sample-application.adoc[Sample Application].
