= Testing Couchbase Server

[abstract]
Testing the connection to the Couchbase Server can be performed in a number of different ways.

Connecting to the node using a web client to connect to Couchbase Web Console provides basic confirmation that your node is available.
Using the `couchbase-cli` command to query your Couchbase Server node will confirm that the node is available.

NOTE: Couchbase Web Console uses the same port number as clients use when communicated with Couchbase Server.
If you can connect to the Couchbase Web Console, administration and database clients can connect to the core cluster port and perform operations.
Couchbase Web Console will also warn if the console loses connectivity to the node.

To verify that your installation works for clients, you can use either the [.cmd]`cbworkloadgen` command, or [.cmd]`telnet`.

The [.cmd]`cbworkloadgen` command uses the Python Client SDK to communicate with the cluster, checking both the cluster administration port and data update ports.

Using [.cmd]`telnet` only checks the memcached compatibility ports and the memcached text-only protocol.
