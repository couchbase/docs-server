= Amazon Linux 2 Installation
:page-edition: enterprise

[abstract]
Couchbase Server version 6.0.1 adds support for the Amazon Linux 2 platform.

[amzn-lnx2-install-rpm]
== Installing Using [.cmd]`rpm`

Install Couchbase Server on Amazon Linux 2 using the [.cmd]`rpm` command-line tool with the downloaded RPM package.

See xref:install-platforms.adoc[Supported Operating Systems] for details.

*Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)*

Newer Linux distributions are known to have the Transparent Huge Pages (THP) feature enabled by default.
THP can cause issues in database software, including Couchbase Server.
THP can cause nodes to lose cluster heartbeats, resulting in erroneous automatic fail overs.
xref:thp-disable.adoc[Disabling Transparent Huge Pages (THP)] prior to installing Couchbase Server is strongly encouraged.

*Complete the Installation*

You must be logged in as `root` (superuser) or use the [.cmd]`sudo` command to complete the installation.
Use the following command to install the Couchbase Server package:

[source,bash]
----
rpm --install couchbase-server-enterprise-version-amzn2.x86_64.rpm
----

where [.var]`version` is the version number of the downloaded package.

After the [.cmd]`rpm` command completes, the Couchbase Server service starts automatically.

After installation is completed, the installation process displays a message similar to the following:

----
    Minimum RAM required : 4 GB
    System RAM configured : 8174464 kilobytes
    Minimum number of processors required :  4 cores
    Number of processors on the system : 4 cores

[#amzn-lnx2-nonroot-nonsudo-]
== Installing as non-root, non-sudo

Installing on Amazon Linux 2 as a non-root, non-sudo user on a single machine.

A non-sudo, non-root installation still runs Couchbase Server and all Couchbase command-line tools.

. After downloading the Couchbase Server RPM, go to the directory where it is located and extract it:
+
[source,bash]
----
rpm2cpio couchbase-server-enterprise-version-amzn2.x86_64.rpm | cpio --extract --make-directories --no-absolute-filenames
----
+
In the directory where the files were extracted, the `opt` and `etc` sub-directories are available.

. After you extract the Couchbase Server installation files, go to the sub-directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd opt/couchbase
----

. Run the following script to relocate the Couchbase Server installation to the present working directory (`pwd`):
+
[source,bash]
----
./bin/install/reloc.sh `pwd`
----
+
This enables you to continue the installation as a non-root, non-sudo user.

. To run the server, use
+
[source,bash]
----
./bin/couchbase-server \-- -noinput -detached
----

. To stop the server, use
+
[source,bash]
----
./bin/couchbase-server -k
----
