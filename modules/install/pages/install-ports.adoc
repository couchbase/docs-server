= Network Configuration

[abstract]
Couchbase Server uses specific network ports for communication between server components and with the clients accessing the data stored in the Couchbase Server cluster.

The ports listed in the following table must be open on the host for Couchbase Server to operate correctly.
Couchbase Server configures these ports automatically, but you must verify that any firewall configuration allows communication on the specified ports for each usage type.
If this is not done, the node can experience difficulty in joining a cluster, including acting as a cluster of one node rather than joining the intended cluster.

The following table lists the ports used for different types of Couchbase Server network communication:

Node-to-node::
Couchbase Server uses these ports for communication between all nodes within the cluster.
These ports must be open to enable nodes to communicate with each other.

Node-to-client:: These ports should be open between each node within the cluster and any client nodes accessing data within the cluster.

Cluster administration:: Couchbase Server uses these ports for administration via the REST API, command-line clients, and web browsers.

XDCR:: These ports are used for XDCR (Cross Datacenter Replication) communication between all nodes in both the source and destination clusters.

* bi-directional

** This port has to be open for GOXDCR to connect to target memcached.

NOTE: Port 11213 is an internal port used on the local host for memcached and triggering manual compaction.
The port is not used for communication between cluster nodes.
For firewall purposes, you do not need to take port 11213 into consideration.
However, if another service is listening on this port, the Couchbase Server service will not start.
