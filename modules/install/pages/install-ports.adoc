= Network Configuration

[abstract]
Couchbase Server uses a variety of network ports for communication between server components and with the clients accessing the data stored in the Couchbase Server cluster.

The ports listed below must be open on each host for Couchbase Server to operate correctly.
In addition, certain ports must be available (i.e.
not blocked by a firewall or other such mechanism) between each node of a cluster, between nodes of multiple clusters connected via XDCR, between application servers and nodes, and for administrative access.

IMPORTANT: If any port numbers are already in use by other running applications, Couchbase Server will not function properly and may fail to start.

The following is a list of port numbers grouped by category of communication path:

Node-local: Only connected to over localhost, needs to be open on the node but not available externally.:: 11213, 6060, 9998

Node-to-node: Between all nodes within a single cluster.:: 4369, 8091-8094, 9100-9105, 9999, 11209, 11210, 21100-21299

Client-to-node: Between any clients/app-servers/SDKs and all nodes of each cluster they require access to.:: Unencrypted*: 8091-8094, 11210, 11211
Encrypted: 18091-18094, 11207

Cluster administration: Administration traffic via the REST API, command-line, and Web UI.:: Unencrypted*: 8091
Encrypted: 18091
*Note:* certain support/diagnostic requests may run against ports other than 8091.
These are expected to execute locally on a node and so do not require external access.

XDCR: Between all source and destination nodes of an XDCR replication stream.:: *v1 (CAPI)*
8091, 8092
*v2 (XMEM)*
Unencrypted*: 8091, 8092, 11210
Encrypted: 8091, 11207, 18091, 18092

*  If enforcing encryption (SSL/TLS), these ports may be blocked outside of a Couchbase Server cluster but need to remain open between nodes.

== Custom Port Mapping

IMPORTANT: Changing the port mappings will require a reset and reconfiguration of any Couchbase Server node.

*Setting up Couchbase Server with Custom Ports*

. Install Couchbase Server (If already running, stop it.
. Add the new user-defined ports to the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ file [this will be at wherever you put [.path]_<path to> /couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ for multiple node installations].
 ** Example, to change the REST API port from 8091 to 9000, add this line:
+
----
{rest_port, 9000}
----

 ** Any ports not listed will be assigned their defaults as listed above
. (Optional) CAPI port (default 8092) can be edited in the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/default.d/capi.ini_ file by replacing 8092 with the new port number.
. If the Couchbase Server was previously configured, delete the [.path]_opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat_ file to remove the old configuration.
. Start Couchbase Server.
