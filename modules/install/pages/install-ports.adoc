[abstract]
Couchbase Server uses multiple TCP ports to facilitate communication between server components, as well as with Couchbase clients.
These ports must be open for Couchbase Server to operate correctly.

== Ports Overview

This page describes the TCP ports that are used by Couchbase Server for network communication.
Some ports, such as those used for cluster management, are required to be open on every node because they are essential to how Couchbase Server communicates with itself. 
Other ports are used by individual xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Couchbase Services], and are only required to be open on the nodes where those services are running.

Couchbase Server uses a default set of port numbers for all ports that it requires.
The xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Couchbase Cluster Manager] on each node is responsible for port management, and will open and close these ports on the host as necessary, as well as automatically switch to using encrypted ports if the cluster is configured to use TLS.
Most port numbers can be <<map-custom-ports,remapped>> to fit the requirements of your network environment, but some port numbers cannot be changed.

IMPORTANT: If other software on the same host is using any of the ports that are required by Couchbase Server, then Couchbase Server will not function properly and may fail to start. 

=== Couchbase Server Communication Paths

Couchbase Server components and services connect to each port over one or more _communication paths_.
These paths are defined as:

* _Node-local_: A Couchbase service running on a node connects to the port on localhost, and communication happens entirely within the node itself.

* _Node-to-node_: A Couchbase service connects to the port on other nodes in the cluster.

* _Client-to-node_: A Couchbase client, such as an application using the Couchbase SDK, connects to the port on the node that it requires access to.

* _XDCR (cluster-to-cluster)_: A source node connects to the port on a destination node of another cluster as part of an xref:manage:manage-xdcr/prepare-for-xdcr.adoc[XDCR replication stream]. 
(This is very similar to the client-to-node communication path.)
+
There are two versions of XDCR that each use their own protocol: Version 1 (CAPI), which uses the REST protocol, and Version 2 (XMEM), which uses the Memcached Binary protocol.
The default is Version 2, and it should be noted that each version requires a different set of ports.
Refer to xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc[XDCR Advanced Settings] for more information about XDCR versions.

Each communication path used by a required port must remain open and unblocked by firewalls or other such mechanisms.

== Ports Listed by Communication Path

NOTE: If enforcing TLS encryption, these ports may be blocked outside of a Couchbase Server cluster but need to remain open between nodes.
|===

NOTE: Certain support and diagnostic requests may run against ports other than the administration port (8091).
These are expected to execute locally on a node and so do not require external access.

[#map-custom-ports]
== Custom Port Mapping

Most, but not all, port numbers used by Couchbase Server can be remapped from their defaults to fit the requirements of your network environment.
Refer to <<table-ports-detailed>> for details about default ports and whether or not they can be remapped.

Changing the port mappings will require a reset and reconfiguration of any Couchbase Server node.

.To Change Port Mapping
. xref:install-intro.adoc[Install Couchbase Server].
. xref:startup-shutdown.adoc[Stop the Couchbase Server service].
. For most ports, you'll need to edit the Couchbase Server [.path]_static_config_ file.
(This will be wherever you put the path to [.path]_/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ in multi-node installations.)
+
[source,console]
----
vi /opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config
----
+
If you're remapping the CAPI port (8092 / 18092) you'll need to edit the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/default.d/capi.ini_ file and replace 8092 with the new port number.
. Add each custom port map entry on its own line, using the following format:
+
[source,console,subs=+quotes]
----
{[.var]_port-name_, [.var]_port-number_}
----
+
For example, to change the REST API port from 8091 to 9000, you would add the following line:
+
[source,console]
----
{rest_port, 9000}
----
+
Once you've added all of your custom port mappings, save the file and close your text editor.
. If Couchbase Server was previously configured, you'll need to delete the [.path]_opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat_ file to remove the old configuration.
+
[source,console]
----
rm -rf opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat
----
. xref:startup-shutdown.adoc[Start Couchbase Server].

Any ports not given a custom mapping in the [.path]_static_config_ file will continue to be assigned their defaults, which are listed in <<table-ports-detailed>>.
