These ports must be open for Couchbase Server to operate correctly.

== Ports Overview

This page describes the TCP ports that are used by Couchbase Server for network communication.
Some ports, such as those used for cluster management, are required to be open on every node because they are essential to how Couchbase Server communicates with itself.
Other ports are used by individual xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Couchbase Services], and are only required to be open on the nodes where those services are running.

Couchbase Server uses a default set of port numbers for all ports that it requires.
The xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Couchbase Cluster Manager] on each node is responsible for port management, and will open and close these ports on the host as necessary, as well as automatically switch to using encrypted ports if the cluster is configured to use TLS.
Most port numbers can be <<map-custom-ports,remapped>> to fit the requirements of your network environment, but some port numbers cannot be changed.

IMPORTANT: If other software on the same host is using any of the ports that are required by Couchbase Server, then Couchbase Server will not function properly and may fail to start.
Refer to <<port-availability>> below.

=== Ephemeral Ports

An _ephemeral_ port is one temporarily allocated by a server's operating system, as the source for an outgoing communication.
Each operating system provides a default range of port numbers that can be assigned to ephemeral ports, when necessary.
For Linux distributions, the typical range is 32768-61000.
Couchbase Server relies on the _full_ default range provided by each operating system: therefore, the default range should _not_ be reduced by the administrator; since the resulting lack of ephemeral ports may result in outgoing communications using _well-known_ ports instead (for example, _8091_); thereby preventing Couchbase-Server processes from binding to the well-known ports to which they are assigned.

=== Couchbase Server Communication Paths

Couchbase Server components and services connect to each port over one or more _communication paths_.
These paths are defined as:

* _Node-local_: A Couchbase service running on a node connects to the port on localhost, and communication happens entirely within the node itself.

* _Node-to-node_: A Couchbase service connects to the port on other nodes in the cluster.

* _Client-to-node_: A Couchbase client, such as an application using the Couchbase SDK, connects to the port on the node that it requires access to.

* _XDCR (cluster-to-cluster)_: A source node connects to the port on a destination node of another cluster as part of an xref:manage:manage-xdcr/prepare-for-xdcr.adoc[XDCR replication stream].
(This is very similar to the client-to-node communication path.)
+
As of Couchbase Server Version 7.0, the XDCR protocol Version 2 (_XMEM_), which uses the Memcached Binary protocol, is the only XDCR protocol supported.
Version 1 (_CAPI_), which used the REST protocol, is no longer supported.
Refer to xref:xdcr-reference:xdcr-advanced-settings.adoc[XDCR Advanced Settings] for information about the XDCR protocol version and other advanced settings.

Each communication path used by a required port must remain open and unblocked by firewalls or other such mechanisms.

[[port-availability]]
=== Port Availability

Neither the xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/cluster-manager.adoc[Cluster Manager] nor any of the Couchbase xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/services.adoc[Services] will start if unable to listen on all required ports.
Note that the cluster manager and all services attempt to bind to required ports using the IP address family  that the Couchbase Server cluster is configured to use (see xref:manage:manage-nodes/manage-address-families.adoc[Manage Address Families]).
Therefore, if the Couchbase Server cluster is configured to use IPv6, the cluster manager and all services attempt to bind to required ports using IPv6; and if the cluster is configured to use IPv4, the cluster manager and all services attempt to bind to required ports using IPv4.
If the cluster manager or service is unable to bind to one or more required ports using the configured IP address family, it will not start.

Refer to the xref:install:install-ports.adoc#detailed-port-description[Detailed Port Description], below, for a list of the ports required by each service.

NOTE: If enforcing TLS encryption, these ports may be blocked outside of a Couchbase Server cluster but need to remain open between nodes.
|===

NOTE: Certain support and diagnostic requests may run against ports other than the administration port (8091).
These are expected to execute locally on a node and so do not require external access.

[#map-custom-ports]
== Custom Port Mapping

Most, but not all, port numbers used by Couchbase Server can be remapped from their defaults to fit the requirements of your network environment.
Refer to <<table-ports-detailed>> for details about default ports and whether or not they can be remapped.

Changing the port mappings will require a reset and reconfiguration of any Couchbase Server node.

WARNING: Changing port mappings should only be done at the time of initial node/cluster setup as the required reset and reconfiguration will also purge all data on the node.

.To Change Port Mapping
. xref:install-intro.adoc[Install Couchbase Server].
. xref:startup-shutdown.adoc[Stop the Couchbase Server service].
. For most ports, you'll need to edit the Couchbase Server [.path]_static_config_ file.
(This will be wherever you put the path to [.path]_/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config_ in multi-node installations.)
+
[source,console]
----
vi /opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config
----
+
If you're remapping the CAPI port (8092 / 18092) you'll need to edit the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/etc/couchdb/default.d/capi.ini_ file and replace 8092 with the new port number.
. Add each custom port map entry on its own line, using the following format (enclosed in braces and terminated by a period):
+
[source,console,subs=+quotes]
----
{[.var]_port-name_, [.var]_port-number_}.
----
+
For example, to change the REST API port from 8091 to 9000, you would add the following line:
+
[source,console]
----
{rest_port, 9000}.
----
+
Once you've added all of your custom port mappings, save the file and close your text editor.
. If Couchbase Server was previously configured, you'll need to delete the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat_ file and files in the [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/chronicle/_ directory to remove the old configuration.
+
[source,console]
----
rm -rf /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat
rm -rf /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/chronicle/*
----
. xref:startup-shutdown.adoc[Start Couchbase Server].

Any ports not given a custom mapping in the [.path]_static_config_ file will continue to be assigned their defaults, which are listed in <<table-ports-detailed>>.
