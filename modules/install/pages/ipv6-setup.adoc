= Using IPv6 With Couchbase

[abstract]
Couchbase Server supports IP version 6 (IPv6).
Set-up is required for each platform.

[caption=Attention]
IMPORTANT: IPv6 support is only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

[#ipv6-overview]
== IPv6 Overview

By default, when Couchbase Server starts up it uses IPv4.
To enable IPv6, set-up is required for each platform, as described in the sections below.
Note that the steps for Linux and macOS are to be performed _after_ the basic Couchbase Server installation is complete, and the steps for Windows are integrated into the basic installation procedure itself.

NOTE: In a clustered setup, IPv6 is enabled only when IPv6 is enabled on all of the nodes.

See xref:install-intro.adoc[Installing the Couchbase Server Cluster] for more information about installation procedures.

== IPv6 Set-Up for Linux

After the Couchbase Server package has been installed, the `couchbase` service is started by default.
To enable IPv6, proceed as follows:

. Stop the `couchbase-server` service.
. In `/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config`, set `ipv6` to `true`.
. Delete `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat`.
. Restart the `couchbase-server` service (this starts Couchbase Server in IPv6 mode).
To check, point a supported web browser to  `http://[::1]:8091`, which is the IPv6 address and port number on which Couchbase Server should be running.

== IPv6 Set-Up for Windows

IPv6 set-up requirements are incorporated into the InstallShield wizard itself.
During installation of the Couchbase package, a check box is available to enable IPv6 mode.
(Note that after installation, any subsequent mode-change requires re-installation.)

[#macos-ipv6-setup]
== IPv6 Set-Up for macOS

After you install the Couchbase Server application, proceed as follows:

. Ensure that the `couchbase-server` service is stopped.
(Quit the Couchbase Server application if it is running.)
. In `/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/etc/couchbase/static_config.in`, set `ipv6` to `true`.
. Delete `~/Library/Application\ Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/config/config.dat`.
. Restart the `couchbase-server` service (this starts Couchbase Server in IPv6 mode).
To check, point a supported web browser to  `http://[::1]:8091`, which is the IPv6 address and port number on which Couchbase Server should be running.
