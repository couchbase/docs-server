Couchbase Server is designed to run in the most popular container environments.
Use this topic to explore the different ways that you can deploy Couchbase in containers.

With the xref:operator::overview.adoc[Couchbase Autonomous Operator], you can easily automate the deployment of Couchbase Server on container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.
