= Start-up and shutdown on Linux

[abstract]
Start-up and shutdown scripts are used to manually start up or shut down Couchbase Server.

On Linux, Couchbase Server is installed as a standalone application with support for running as a background (daemon) process during start-up through the use of a standard control script, which is located in [.path]_ /etc/init.d/couchbase-server_.

The startup script is automatically installed during installation from one of the Linux packaged releases (Debian/Ubuntu or Red Hat/CentOS).
By default, Couchbase Server is configured to be started automatically at run levels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and explicitly shut down at run levels 0, 1 and 6.

To manually start Couchbase Server using the startup/shutdown script:

----
> sudo /etc/init.d/couchbase-server start
----

To manually stop Couchbase Server using the startup/shutdown script:

----
> sudo /etc/init.d/couchbase-server stop
----
