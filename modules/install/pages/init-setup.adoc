= Initialize the Cluster

[abstract]
After completing the installation, your next step is to initialize the cluster.
You can initialize the cluster using the Couchbase Web Console, CLI, or REST API.
Only Full Administrators can perform the initial Couchbase Server setup.

[#initialize-cluster-web-console]
== Initialize the Cluster Using the Web Console

TIP: Clear your browser's cache before starting the setup process.
You can find notes and tips on how to do this for different browsers and platforms on www.wikihow.com.

On all platforms you can access the Couchbase Web Console by connecting to the embedded web server on port 8091.
For example, if your server can be identified on your network as `servera`, you can access the Couchbase Web Console by opening `http://servera:8091/`.
You can also use an IP address or, if you are on the same machine, `http://localhost:8091`.
If you set up Couchbase Server on a port other than `8091`, go to that specified port.

To set up Couchbase Server with the Couchbase Web Console, click on [.uicontrol]*Setup*.

*Step 1: Configure Server*

As a default, the first setup screen will provide you with a choice to ether start a new cluster or join an existing one.

. *Start a new cluster*
+
Stay on the default screen to set up a new cluster.
Since the same setting applies to the whole cluster, the same amount of memory will be allocated on each node.
Therefore, specify a value that can be supported by all nodes.
+
The default value is 60% of your total free RAM and is calculated to provide a RAM capacity for use by the operating system caching layer when accessing and using views.
+
[#image_ac2_2tf_x5]

+
For a new cluster, the following setup fields are displayed:
[#ul_yqx_w5m_zv]
 ** RAM Available
 ** Services: Select one of the service types for the production environment; select one to three service types for the development environment.
 ** Data RAM Quota: 256 MB or more.
 ** Full Text RAM Quota: 256 MB more.
 ** Index RAM Quota: 256 MB or more.
 ** Total Per Server: RAM quota per server represents total RAM used by the data and index services.
 ** Index Storage Setting: choose between Standard and Memory-Optimized Global Secondary Indexes.

If, however, you are joining an existing cluster, click on the radio button [.uicontrol]*Join a cluster now*.

*Join a cluster now*

[#image_r3t_htm_zv]
image::admin/picts/cluster-setup-01-join.png[,720,align=left]

If you are joining a cluster, the following setup fields will be displayed:
 ** The IP address of the cluster you are joining.
 ** The username of the Couchbase Server administrator who is managing this cluster.
 ** The password of the Couchbase Server administrator who is managing this cluster.
 ** Services: Select one of the service types for the production environment; select one to three service types for the development environment.

. [.uicontrol]*Configure Disk Storage*

For both setup options, configure the disk storage as follows:
 ** Database Path: Shows the default location where the database files will be stored:
+
[.path]_/Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data_.
+
and points to the current amount of free space for this location.

 ** Indices Path: Shows the default locations where indices will be stored:
+
[.path]_/Users/user_name/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data _
+
and points to the current amount of free space for this location.

NOTE: For the production environment, it is recommended to use different file locations.

. [.uicontrol]*Configure Server Hostname*.
 ** Provide a node IP or a hostname.
The provided hostname survives node restart.
+
For more details about hostnames, see xref:hostnames.adoc#topic_ggq_hfy_p4[Using Hostnames].
. [.uicontrol]*Join Cluster/Start new Cluster* The [.uicontrol]*Configure Server Memory* section sets the amount of physical RAM that will be allocated by the Couchbase Server for storage.

If you are creating a new cluster, this is the amount of memory that is allocated on each node within your Couchbase Server cluster.
The same amount of memory is allocated to each node in the cluster.
Since the same setting applies to the whole cluster, specify a value that can be supported by all nodes.
The default value is 60% of your total free RAM and is calculated to provide a RAM capacity for use by the operating system caching layer when accessing and using views.
 ** [.uicontrol]*Start a new cluster*
+
If you select this option, the following setup fields will be displayed:
  *** RAM Available
  *** Services: Select one of the service types for the production environment; select one or more service types for the development environment.
  *** Data RAM Quota: 256 MB or more.
  *** Index RAM Quota: 256 MB or more.
  *** Full Text RAM Quota: 256 MB or more
  *** Total Per Server: RAM quota per server represents total RAM used by the data and index services.
  *** Index Storage Setting: Select one of settings: Global Index (`default`) or Memory-Optimized Global Index (`memopt`)

 ** [.uicontrol]*Join a cluster now*:

If you select this option, the following setup fields will be displayed:
  *** The IP address of the cluster you are joining.
  *** The username of the Couchbase Server administrator who is managing this cluster.
  *** The password of the Couchbase Server administrator who is managing this cluster.
  *** Services: Select one of the service types for the production environment; select one to three service types for the development environment.

 ** [.uicontrol]*Configure Server Hostname*

For both setup options, configure the hostnames as follows:
  *** Provide a node IP or a hostname.
The provided hostname survives node restart.
+
For more details about hostnames, see xref:hostnames.adoc#topic_ggq_hfy_p4[Using Hostnames].

 ** Click [.uicontrol]*Next*.

*Step 2: Install Sample Buckets*

A screen appears where you can select the sample data buckets you want to install.

[#image_f4x_rpy_dt]
image::setup-02.png[,720,align=left]

. Click the names of sample buckets to load to the Couchbase Server.
These data sets demonstrate Couchbase Server's features and help you understand and develop views.
If you decide to install sample data, the installer creates one Couchbase bucket for each set of sample data you choose.
. Click [.uicontrol]*Next*.

*Step 3: Create default bucket*

For the default bucket, look also at the [.uicontrol]*What's this?* pop-ups and configure the following:

Bucket Settings:: Bucket Name: The name of the Default bucket is pre-set.
Bucket Type: Couchbase (preset) or Memcached

Memory Size:: Per Node RAM Quota
Total bucket size
Cache Metadata: Value Ejection (preset) or Full Ejection

Replicas:: Enable (preset): select the number of replica backup copies.
View index replicas

Disk I/O Optimization:: Set the bucket disk I/O priority: Low (the default) or High.

Flush:: Enable

Click [.uicontrol]*Next*.

*Step 4: Notifications*

[#image_xnp_bry_dt]
image::setup-04.png[,720,align=left]

Update Notifications::
Select [.uicontrol]*Update Notifications*.
The Couchbase Web Console communicates with Couchbase Server nodes and confirms the version numbers of each node.

[#initialize-cluster-cli]
== Initialize the Cluster Using the CLI

The following CLI syntax is used to initially set up a single-node Couchbase Server cluster, administrative credentials, port number, add all services, set the RAM quota separately for Data, Index, and Search services,  and set the index storage option to memory-optimized global indexes:

----
couchbase-cli cluster-init OPTIONS:
          --cluster-username=USER //new admin username
          --cluster-password=PASSWORD //new admin password
          --cluster-port=PORT //new cluster REST/http port
          --services=data,index,query,fts //services that server runs 
          --cluster-ramsize=RAMSIZEMB //per node data service ram quota in MB
          --cluster-index-ramsize=RAMSIZEMB //per node index service ram quota in MB
