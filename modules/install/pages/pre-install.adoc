*_You can reduce the CPU and RAM resources below the Minimum Specifications for development and testing purposes.
Resources can be as low as 1 GB of free RAM beyond operating system requirements, and a single CPU core.
However, you must adhere to the Minimum Specifications for production._

**_The Recommended Specifications don't take into account your intended workload.
You should follow the xref:sizing-general.adoc[sizing guidelines] when determining system specifications for your Couchbase Server deployment._
