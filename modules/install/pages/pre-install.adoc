= System Resource Requirements

[abstract]
Although resource requirements will largely depend on the size and resource demands of your Couchbase deployment, there are some minimum and recommended specifications that you should follow.

TIP: You can reduce the CPU and RAM resources below the minimum requirements for development and testing purposes.
Resources can be as low as 1GB of free RAM beyond operating system requirements, and a single CPU core.
However, you must use at least the minimum system requirements for production.

The recommended specifications do not take into account your intended workload.
You should follow the sizing guidelines detailed in xref:sizing-general.adoc[Sizing Guidelines] when deciding on machine specifications to run Couchbase Server.
