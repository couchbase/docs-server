[abstract]
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of web services that make up a cloud-computing platform.

The recommended and often easiest way to get started is to use the Couchbase Server Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

AMIs provides the information required to launch an instance of a virtual server in the cloud and are available within the AWS Marketplace.

NOTE: In this guide, command line examples that begin with $ are run in a standard Linux shell.
