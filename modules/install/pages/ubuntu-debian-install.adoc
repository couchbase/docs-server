= Ubuntu/Debian Installation

[abstract]
This installation information applies both to Ubuntu and Debian platforms.

Only 64 bit systems are supported.

You need to be logged in as root (superuser) to complete the installation.

On modern versions of Debian (Debian 8+) and Ubuntu (Ubuntu 14.04+), the "apt" command simplifies the installation greatly.

. Download and install the appropriate meta package from the https://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-4-amd64.deb[package download location^].
This will install the package source and the Couchbase public keys:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -O http://packages.couchbase.com/releases/couchbase-release/couchbase-release-1.0-4-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i couchbase-release-1.0-4-amd64.deb
----

. Run the following commands to automatically download and install Couchbase along with the appropriate `libssl` and Python dependencies.
+
----
apt-get update
apt install ./couchbase-server.deb
----
+
NOTE: The "./" in the command is necessary as the command expects a path.
Otherwise the apt command handles it like a package name.

. On earlier versions of Debian, run the following commands to install Couchbase Server:
+
----
apt-get update
dpkg -i ./couchbase-server.deb
apt-get -f install
----
+
Couchbase Server starts automatically and is configured to automatically start during boot under the 2, 3, 4, and 5 run levels.
+
Refer to the Ubuntu documentation for more information about installing packages using the Debian package manager.
+
After installation is completed, the installation process displays a message similar to the following:
+
