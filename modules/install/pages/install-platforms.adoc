= Supported Operating Systems

[abstract]
Couchbase Server is supported on several popular operating systems and virtual environments.

Make sure that your chosen operating system is listed in one of the following tables before you install Couchbase Server.
See the xref:release-notes:relnotes.adoc[release notes] for information about platform support changes, including deprecated platforms.
