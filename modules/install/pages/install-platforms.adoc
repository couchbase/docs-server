*Certified*: Couchbase has performed an extensive testing and review process to make sure that Couchbase Server runs well out of the box on the specified platform.

*Supported*: Couchbase believes that Couchbase Server will run well out of the box on the specified platform, but extensive testing has not been performed.
Couchbase will make a best effort to investigate issues on a Supported platform version, but it is recommended that you run Couchbase on a Certified platform version.

Nodes in a Couchbase cluster should all be running on the same OS, and every effort should be made to apply the same OS patches across the entire cluster.
