== Supported Operating Systems

Make sure that your chosen operating system is listed below, before you install Couchbase Server.

Note that Couchbase clusters on mixed platforms are not supported.
Nodes in a Couchbase cluster should all be running on the same OS, and every effort should be made to apply the same OS patches across the entire cluster.

ARM64 support requires ARMv8 CPUs, such as the Amazon Graviton series.
