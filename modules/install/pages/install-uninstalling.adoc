{description}

Uninstalling Couchbase Server from a system involves removing the Couchbase Server application along with any directories containing Couchbase configuration files, data, and logs.

This page describes how to uninstall Couchbase Server from Linux, Windows, and MacOS systems; and assumes that a standard _package-based_ install has previously been performed.
For information on uninstalling Couchbase Server after a _non-root_ install has been performed, see the non-root xref:install:non-root.adoc#uninstall-non-root-couchbase-server[Uninstall] information.

== Before You Uninstall

If the system is a part of an active Couchbase cluster, you'll need to xref:manage:manage-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc[remove it and rebalance the cluster] to take the node out of the configuration.
You'll also need to update Couchbase clients to point to an available node within the active cluster.

[WARNING]
====
The instructions on this page will completely remove Couchbase Server, and all configuration and database files.
Ensure that your configuration and data are backed up before proceeding, as this process cannot be undone.
