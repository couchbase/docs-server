= Post-installation

[abstract]
Post-installation activities includes initializing the cluster and testing the server connections.

TIP: Clear your browser's cache before starting the setup process.
You can find notes and tips on how to do this for different browsers and platforms on www.wikihow.com.

On all platforms you can access the Couchbase Web Console by connecting to the embedded web server on port 8091.
For example, if your server can be identified on your network as `servera`, you can access the Couchbase Web Console by opening `+http://servera:8091/+`.
You can also use an IP address or, if you are on the same machine, `+http://localhost:8091+`.
If you set up Couchbase Server on a port other than `8091`, go to that specified port.
