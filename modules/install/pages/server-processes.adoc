= Couchbase Server Processes
:description: Couchbase Server spawns a number of different processes on each node.

[abstract]
{description}
These processes vary in type and number depending on which Couchbase services are running on a particular node.

Couchbase Server spawns processes from a set of binaries that get installed by the Couchbase installer.
Some of these processes support the basic functions of Couchbase Server, and run on every node in the Couchbase cluster (Core).
Other processes, however, support the various Couchbase services, and only run on the nodes that happen to run a particular Couchbase service (Data, Query, Index, Search, Analytics, and Eventing).

The tables on this page list out all of the Couchbase processes, along with the specific Couchbase services that will invoke them.
If a particular Couchbase service is not running on a node, then the processes associated with that service will not run.

It's important that each of these processes is allowed to run and access files on the nodes that are enabled for the Couchbase services that they support.
Otherwise, Couchbase Server will not function properly.
Depending on your security environment, you may need to explicitly approve these processes and their binary directories in your security policy.

== Linux

The following table lists the Couchbase processes that run on Linux platforms.
