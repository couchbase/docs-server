= Migrating from Relational Databases
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Migration guidelines for relational database users.
In this section, we use MySQL as an example relational database.

When migrating from MySQL to Couchbase Server, there are several things that you might want to think about, starting with the data model, data types, and feature set differences.

== Data Model – Mapping from MySQL to Couchbase Server

Data modeling for RDBMS has been a well-defined discipline for many years.
Professionals, including novice users, have been practicing techniques such as logical to physical mapping and normalization / de-normalization.
However, the old-school RDBMS data modeling techniques still play a meaningful role for those who are new to the NoSQL technology.

== Feature Set

Like MySQL, Couchbase Server offers a rich set of features and functionality far beyond those offered in simple key-value stores.

With Couchbase Server, you also get an expressive SQL-like query language and query engine called xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[N1QL], which is combined with a new powerful indexing mechanism – xref:learn:services-and-indexes/indexes/global-secondary-indexes.adoc[Global Secondary Indexes].

. The result is set in JSON instead of rows and columns.
. NEST, UNNEST
. Operations on datetime fields require datetime functions in N1QL.
. JSON-induced functions in N1QL: JSON, Object, and array functions.
. Type and comparison functions.
. JOIN, sub-query format differences.
. `USING KEYS` and ON KEYS functions

== ETL Tools

You might have a spectrum of relational, operational, and analytical data sources in your environment.
You might also need more sophistication applied to a data movement situation, such as more than just simple extract-load.
Various tools are available, but the most common use cases are best served by combining our xref:connectors:odbc-jdbc-drivers.html[JDBC drivers] with our xref:java-sdk:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Java SDK].
