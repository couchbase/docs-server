= Starting and Stopping Couchbase Server

[abstract]
Start and stop the Couchbase Server service.

== Linux

On Linux, Couchbase Server is installed as a standalone application with support for running as a background (daemon) process during startup.
The startup script is automatically installed when you use any of the packaged releases of Couchbase Server for Linux.
By default, Couchbase Server is configured to start automatically at run levels 2, 3, 4, and 5, and explicitly shut down at run levels 0, 1, and 6.

.Start and Stop Couchbase Server
[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl start couchbase-server
----
[source,console]
----
sudo systemctl stop couchbase-server
----

=== Legacy Linux

The instructions in the previous section are meant to be used on modern versions of Linux that use systemd for init processing.
For versions of Linux that use SysV for init processing, you need to use the `service` command for starting and stopping Couchbase Server.

.Start and Stop Couchbase Server (Legacy)
[source,console]
----
sudo service couchbase-server start
----
[source,console]
----
sudo service couchbase-server stop
----

////
//Removed because it likely doesn't apply to any OS configuration that is still supported by Couchbase.
[NOTE]
====
On CentOS, you may see a failure when trying to run `service couchbase-server start` as a root user:

[source,console]
----
Failed to start couchbase-server.service: Access denied
----

This failure could be caused by https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1224211[a bug^] in `systemd`.
It's recommended that you try using the suggested workaround of running `systemctl daemon-reexec` before running `service couchbase-server start` again.

== Windows

On Windows, Couchbase Server is installed as a Windows service.
By default, the Couchbase Server service automatically starts when the system boots.

You can manage the service using the Windows Services app, the `net` command, or with Couchbase-supplied batch scripts.
You need to be logged into a user account that has administrator privileges, or one that has separately granted rights to manage the Couchbase Server service.

.Start and Stop Couchbase Server with the Windows Services App
. Open the Services app.
+
You can search for `services.msc` in Windows to find the app quickly.

. Find *CouchbaseServer* in the list of services and right-click on it.
+

+
You can start and stop the service from this menu, or select menu:[Properties] to configure how the service runs, such as whether it starts at system boot.
+
NOTE: If *CouchbaseServer* isn't in the list, then you should attempt to start the service using the batch script method below.

.Start and Stop Couchbase Server with the `net` Command
----
net start CouchbaseServer
----
----
net stop CouchbaseServer
----

.Start and Stop Couchbase Server with Batch Scripts
. In File Explorer, go to `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\install\`.
+
The scripts are named something similar to `cb_winsvc_start_<version>.bat`.

. Right-click on the script that you want to use and select menu:[Run as administrator].
+
A User Account Control prompt may ask for your permission to run Windows Command Processor.
Click *Yes*.
+
A terminal window will open and display the Couchbase Server startup and shutdown progress.
The window will automatically close if the process is successful.

== macOS

On macOS, Couchbase Server is installed as a standard application that resides in the system Applications folder.

To start Couchbase Server, go to the Applications folder and double-click on `Couchbase Server.app`.
Couchbase Server runs as a background application, and when it starts, the Couchbase Server icon image:macos-menu-bar-icon-light.png[Couchbase Server menu bar icon,16] will appear in the menu bar.

To stop Couchbase Server, click image:macos-menu-bar-icon-light.png[Couchbase Server menu bar icon,16] and select menu:[Quit Couchbase Server].
The menu bar icon will disappear when Couchbase Server shuts down.
