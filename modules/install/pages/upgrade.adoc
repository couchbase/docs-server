== Understanding Upgrade

To _upgrade_ a Couchbase-Server cluster means to revise upwards the version of the server that is running on every node.
For example, a cluster each of whose nodes has been running Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition Version 6.6 is modified; such that each of its nodes subsequently runs Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition Version 7.0.

An _upgrade procedure_, like an install procedure, involves both preparation routines and specific upgrade commands that are performed on each individual node.
To be upgraded, a cluster must have each of its nodes individually upgraded in turn; and the upgrade procedure for the cluster must therefore be selected with regards to whether the cluster is required to continue serving data, or to cease serving data, during the course of the cluster-upgrade.
A review of the factors that determine the appropriateness of an upgrade-procedure is provided in xref:install:upgrade-procedure-selection.adoc[Upgrade Procedure-Selection].

[#supported-upgrade-paths]
== Upgrade Paths

An upgrade _path_ declares that the upgrade of one version of Couchbase Server to another is _supported_.
The tables in the following subsections list upgrade paths for Enterprise and Community Edition, respectively.
Each instance of the sign -> declares support for the upgrade of the server-version on the left of the sign to the server-version on the right.
Note that upgrade between non-adjacent version-numbers is frequently _not_ supported: for example, to upgrade from 5.5.0+ to 7.0, upgrade must be performed _twice_; first from 5.5.0+ to 6.6, and secondly from 6.6 to 7.0.

All supported upgrades can be performed with the cluster either _offline_ or _online_.

[#upgrade-community-enterprise]
== Upgrade from Community Edition to Enterprise

To upgrade a cluster running Community Edition to a cluster running Enterprise Edition, the version-number of the Enterprise Edition must be identical to that of the Community Edition.
Therefore, if the target version-number of the Enterprise Edition is higher, the cluster should first be upgraded to the Enterprise version-number that is identical to the Community Edition version-number, then upgraded to the higher Enterprise Edition version-number, according to the paths described above, in xref:install:upgrade.adoc#supported-upgrade-paths[Supported Upgrade Paths].

See xref:install:upgrade-procedure-selection.adoc[Upgrade Procedure-Selection], for a list of procedures that can be used when upgrading from Community Edition to Enterprise.
Note, however, that _Graceful Failover_ for Data Service nodes, with _Delta Recovery_, is _not_ supported for such upgrades: instead, _removal_, _addition_, and _swap rebalance_ should be used; for all nodes.

[#downgrade]
== Downgrade

Once an upgrade of a Couchbase-Server cluster has started, _downgrade_ to the earlier version of Couchbase Server can be performed, as long as one node is still running the earlier version.
Once all nodes are running the later version, downgrade cannot be performed: therefore, should application-support require the earlier version, a new cluster must be created.
