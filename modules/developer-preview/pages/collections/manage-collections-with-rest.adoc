_Collections_ can be managed by means of the Couchbase REST API.

[#Using the REST API]
== Using the REST API

The following sequence of REST API commands demonstrates how to create, examine, and delete scopes and collections.
It assumes that Couchbase Server has been installed, initialized, and provisioned on a _Ubuntu_ system.
Note, however, that the sequence should work identically on other Linux systems; as well as on MacOS and Windows systems.

At the command-line prompt, proceed as follows:

. Create a bucket, named `testBucket`, using the `/pools/default/buckets` REST method:
+
----
curl -X POST -u Administrator:password \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets \
-d name=testBucket \
-d ramQuotaMB=100
----
+
For information on this REST call and its parameters, see xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-create.adoc[Creating and Editing Buckets].

. Create a scope. This is a POST operation, using the `/pools/default/buckets/_<bucket>_/collections` endpoint, and specifying the `-name` parameter.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections \
-d name=my_scope
----
+
If successful, the command returns a _uid_ for the action (this is principally for internal use, and need not be tracked by the user):
+
----
{"uid":1}
----
+
Now, examine the collections _manifest_ for the specified bucket.
This is a GET operation, using the same endpoint as the previous POST, with no parameter.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
This returns the following output:
+
----
{"uid":"1","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
Formatted, this output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "1",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": []
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This output shows that the bucket now contains two scopes, which are `my_scope` and `_default`.
The `_default` scope contains a single collection, which is also named `_default`.

. Create two collections, within the created scope.
This requires a POST operation, specifying the created scope as endpoint, and using the -name parameter to specify the new collection-name.
For the first collection, enter the following command:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/my_scope \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
If successful, the operation returns a uid.
+
----
{"uid":2}
----
+
Create the second collection as follows:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/my_scope \
-d name=my_collection_in_my_scope_2
----
+
Again, success returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":3}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
The unformatted output is as follows:
+
----
{"uid":"3","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9"},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8"}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
When formatted, the output takes the following appearance:
+
----
{
  "uid": "3",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9"
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that the collections `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` and `my_collection_in_my_scope_2` have been successfully created in `my_scope`.

. Create a collection in the default scope.
This is a POST operation, specifying the `_default` scope as endpoint, and the `-name` parameter to specify the new collection-name.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X POST \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/_default \
-d name=my_collection_in_default_scope
----
+
A uid is returned:
+
----
{"uid":4}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
This returns the following:
+
----
{"uid":"4","scopes":[{"name":"my_scope","uid":"8","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_2","uid":"9"},{"name":"my_collection_in_my_scope_1","uid":"8"}]},{"name":"_default","uid":"0","collections":[{"name":"my_collection_in_default_scope","uid":"a"},{"name":"_default","uid":"0"}]}]}
----
+
When formatted the output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "4",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9"
        },
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_1",
          "uid": "8"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a"
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+
This indicates that the collection `my_collection_in_default_scope` has been successfully created in the `_default` scope, and so appears alongside the `_default` collection.

. Drop a collection from the created scope.
This requires a DELETE operation, and the endpoint that specifies the collection that is to be dropped.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X DELETE \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/\
my_scope/my_collection_in_my_scope_1
----
+
This returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":5}
----
+
Now, re-examine the collections manifest for the bucket.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
The output (here formatted) indicates that the collection `my_collection_in_my_scope_1` has successfully been dropped from my_scope:
+
----
{
  "uid": "5",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "my_scope",
      "uid": "8",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_my_scope_2",
          "uid": "9"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a"
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----


. Drop the created scope, and examine the manifest.
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X DELETE \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections/my_scope
----
+
This returns a uid:
+
----
{"uid":6}
----
+
Examine the manifest:
+
----
curl -u Administrator:password -X GET \
http://localhost:8091/pools/default/buckets/testBucket/collections
----
+
The output (here formatted), the output is as follows:
+
----
{
  "uid": "6",
  "scopes": [
    {
      "name": "_default",
      "uid": "0",
      "collections": [
        {
          "name": "my_collection_in_default_scope",
          "uid": "a"
        },
        {
          "name": "_default",
          "uid": "0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

----
+
This indicates that `my_scope`  has successfully been dropped; and with it, the collection `my_collection_in_my_scope_2`.

This concludes the sequence of commands.
