== Syntax

----
cbstats host:11210 [common options] scopes-details [vbucket-reference]
----

== Description

This command is used to provide low-level details on scopes, for a specified bucket.
This includes details identifying the existing scopes; and vBucket-specific details, which include sequence numbers and item counts.

== Options

The optional `vbucket-reference` parameter is an integer, in the range of `0` to `1023` inclusive, specifying a particular vBucket.
If a vBucket is specified, the only details returned are the vBucket-specific details for that vBucket.
If no vBucket is specified, vBucket-specific details for all vBuckets are returned, as well as details identifying the existing scopes for the bucket.

For common [.cmd]`cbstats` options, see xref:cli:cbstats-intro.adoc[cbstats].

== Examples

The following command retrieves scopes-details on all vBuckets for `testBucket`:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 scopes-details
----

The initial section of the output is as follows:

----
manifest:scopes:                         2
manifest:scopes:0x0:collections:         2
manifest:scopes:0x0:name:                _default
manifest:scopes:0x8:collections:         2
manifest:scopes:0x8:name:                my_scope
manifest:uid:                            4
vb_0:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:0:    0xa
vb_0:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:2:    0x0
vb_0:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:1:    0x9
vb_0:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:3:    0x8
vb_0:manifest:scopes:                    2
vb_0:manifest:scopes:0:                  0x8
vb_0:manifest:scopes:1:                  0x0
vb_1:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:0:    0xa
vb_1:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:2:    0x0
vb_1:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:1:    0x9
vb_1:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:3:    0x8
      .
      .
      .
----

The initial six lines provide information that identifies existing scopes.
A total of `2` are listed, including the `_default` scope.
Each is identified with a hexadecimal number: for example, the `_default` scope is identified as `0x0`.

Subsequent information in the output relates to each vBucket corresponding to `testBucket`.
The vBuckets are numbered, from `0` to `1023`.
For each vBucket, information is provided on sequence numbers and total items.

The following command specifies a `vbucket-reference`, thereby returning information on the specified vBucket only:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/cbstats -u Administrator -p password \
-b testBucket localhost:11210 scopes-details 8
----

Details for vBucket `8` are duly returned:

----
vb_8:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:0: 0xa
vb_8:manifest:scope:0x0:collection:2: 0x0
vb_8:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:1: 0x9
vb_8:manifest:scope:0x8:collection:3: 0x8
vb_8:manifest:scopes:                 2
vb_8:manifest:scopes:0:               0x8
vb_8:manifest:scopes:1:               0x0
