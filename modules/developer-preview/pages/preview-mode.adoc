= Developer Preview Mode and Features
:description: Developer Preview mode (or Preview mode for short), provides early access to features which may be GA in a future release and enables you to play with these features and get a sense of how they work.

[abstract]
{description} Preview mode features are not supported by Couchbase Legal Agreements, may not be functionally complete, and are not intended for production use. They are intended for development and testing purposes only.

Introduced in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition 6.5, Developer Preview mode is disabled by default and requires you to explicitly enable it using the CLI or REST API. It is important to note that when Preview mode is enabled, the cluster is converted to a Developer Preview cluster and cannot be switched back. Preview mode features are under development and as such Couchbase cannot guarantee the stability of these features. Additionally, clusters in Preview mode cannot be upgraded to subsequent releases.

Developer Preview Mode can be enabled using the CLI or REST API, however as noted above, once enabled, it cannot be disabled.

Note that the commands on this page assume a Ubuntu Linux environment. For the appropriate command-paths, see xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI Reference].

== How do I know if my cluster is in Developer Preview mode?

If your cluster is in Developer Preview mode, the Admin console displays the following banner:

You can also verify whether Preview mode has been enabled on your cluster by running the `couchbase-cli enable-developer-preview` command with the `--list` flag, and specifying the cluster-address, and the Full Administrator username and password as shown:

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli enable-developer-preview \
--list -c localhost:8091 -u Administrator -p password
----

If the cluster is not in Preview Mode, the following output is displayed:

----
Cluster is NOT in developer preview mode
----

If the cluster _is_ in Preview Mode, the output is as follows:

----
Cluster is in developer preview mode
----

== How do I enable the Developer Preview mode?

To enable the Developer Preview Mode, run the `couchbase-cli enable-developer-preview` command with the `--enable` flag, and specify the cluster-address, and the Full Administrator username and password as shown below.

----
/opt/couchbase/bin/couchbase-cli enable-developer-preview \
--enable -c localhost:8091 -u Administrator -p password
