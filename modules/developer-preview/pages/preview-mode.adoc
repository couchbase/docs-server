= Developer Preview Mode and Features
:description: Developer Preview mode (“Preview Mode”), provides early access to features which may become generally available (“GA”) in future releases and enables you to play with these features to get a sense of how they work.

[abstract]
{description} Preview Mode features and their use are subject to Couchbase’s “Non-GA Offering Supplemental Terms” set forth in the https://www.couchbase.com/LA08242020[License Agreement]. Preview Mode features may not be functionally complete and are not intended for production use. They are intended for development and testing purposes only.

The Developer Preview Mode is disabled by default. You can enable it using the CLI or REST API.

It is important to note that when Preview Mode is enabled, the cluster is converted to a Developer Preview cluster and cannot be switched back. Preview Mode features are under development and as such Couchbase cannot guarantee the stability of these features. Additionally, clusters in Preview Mode cannot be upgraded to subsequent releases.

Developer Preview Mode can be enabled using the CLI or REST API, however, as noted above, once enabled, it cannot be disabled.

Note that the commands on this page assume a Ubuntu Linux environment. For the appropriate command-paths, see xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc[CLI Reference].

== How do I know if my cluster is in Developer Preview Mode?

If your cluster is in Developer Preview Mode, the Web Console displays the following banner:
