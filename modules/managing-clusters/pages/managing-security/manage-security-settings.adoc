= Manage Security Settings

[abstract]
Couchbase Server security-settings can be managed from Couchbase Web
Console, and by means of the REST API.

[#couchbase-security-settings]
== Couchbase Security Settings
The basic settings for Couchbase security, available to _Full_ and
_Security_ administrators, allow configuration of the following:

* _Users_: Users can be created, given passwords, and assigned roles that
allow them to access specific system resources.

* The _Root Certificate_ for the node, which allows the server to identify
itself to clients.

* _Client Certificate_ settings, which determine whether a client can or
must present a certificate in order to authenticate with the server.

* _Audit_ settings, determining which system events are audited.

* _Log Redaction_ settings, determining what forms of content are to
be considered private, and redacted from system logs.

* _Session_ management, whereby users are logged out of Couchbase Web
Console after a specified period of inactivity.

These areas are described below.

[#access-security-screen]
== Access the Security Screen

To start managing Couchbase Server security-settings, within Couchbase
Web Console, access the *Security* screen, by means of the *Security* tab,
on the left-hand navigation bar:

[#access-security-screen]
image::managing-security/accessSecurityScreen.png[,100,align=left]

This brings up the *Security* screen, which appears as follows:

[#couchbase-security-screen]
image::managing-security/securityView.png[,800,align=left]

Note the tabs that run from left to right, along the upper, horizontal
control-bar. These are *Users*, *Root Certificate*, *Client Certificate*,
*Audit*, *Log Redaction*, and *Session*. To display the corresponding
screen-content for each, left-click on the tab:

[#access-users-panel]
image::managing-security/accessUsersPanel.png[,150,align=left]

[#users-security-screen-display]
=== Users

The *Users* display (shown above) lists users currently registered on
the cluster. Each user has a *username* and (optionally) a *full name*; and
has one or more *roles* associated with them. These roles are associated
with _privileges_ that permit access to specified system-resources. The
*auth domain* for each user can be _Local_ or _External_. To add users and,
in so doing, assign them roles, administrators use the *ADD USER* button, at
the upper right.

A full account of adding and editing users is provided in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-security/manage-users.adoc[Manage Users].

[#root-certificate-security-screen-display]
Root Certificate

This displays the _Root Certificate_ for the cluster:

[#root-certificate-panel]
image::managing-security/rootCertificateDisplay.png[,600,align=left]

Initially, before
any administrator-driven configuration has occurred, this is a _self-signed_
certificate. To increase system-security, a new X.509 certificate should be
created.

See
xref:managing-clusters:managing-security/manage-certificates.adoc[Manage
Certificates], for further information on creating and using certificates for
both server and client.

Note that the procedures for securing _Cross Data Center Replication_ (XDCR)
may involve use of the root certificate: if so, the certificate can be
copied from this screen. See
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/secure-xdcr-replication.adoc[Secure
a Replication] for details.
