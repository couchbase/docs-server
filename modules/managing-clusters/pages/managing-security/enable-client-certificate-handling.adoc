= Enable Client-Certificate Handling

[abstract]
Couchbase Server can be enabled to support certificate-based
authentication by networked clients.

== Enabling x.509 Certificate Based Authentication on the Server

You can enable certificate based authentication on the server using REST API or CLI.

This authentication mechanism is available only for the data service and can be used with SDK/clients as well.
For query and other services, use the other supported authentication mechanisms.

*Using REST API*

. Create a data file containing the payload for your certificate authentication settings.
For example, `cb-certauth-setting.json`:
+
----
{
	"state": "enable",
	"prefixes": [{
			"path": "san.uri",
			"prefix": "www.",
			"delimiter": "."
		},
		{
			"path": "san.email",
			"prefix": "couchbase.",
			"delimiter": "."
		}
	]
}
----

. Run the following command to enable x.509 certificate authentication on the server.
+
----
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @cb-certauth-setting.json http://Administrator:password@127.0.0.1:8091/settings/clientCertAuth
----

To retrieve the client certificate authentication settings, run the following command:

----
curl -X GET  Administrator:password@localhost:8091/settings/clientCertAuth
----

.Result
----
{"state":"enable","prefixes":[{"delimiter":".","path":"san.uri","prefix":"www."},{"delimiter":".","path":"san.email","prefix":"couchbase."}]}
----

*Using CLI*

Use the [.cmd]`couchbase-cli` xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-ssl-manage.adoc#couchbaseclisslmanage1.idm68744912[ssl-manage] command:

----
couchbase-cli ssl-manage <options>
----

[cols="20,20,49"]
|===
| Options | Value | Description

| --set-client-auth-state
| disable {vbar} enable {vbar} mandatory
a|
Enable or disable the SSL client certificate authentication.

* [.param]`disable`: Disables client based certificate authentication.
This is the default value.
* [.param]`enable`:  When enabled, if the client presents a certificate,
then that certificate is used to authenticate.
If authentication fails, then access is denied.
However, if the client does not present a certificate, the certificate based
authentication will be bypassed.
* [.param]`mandatory`: The client must present a valid certificate in order to
gain access to Couchbase buckets.
If using XDCR, *do not* use the [.param]`mandatory` state for X.509 Certificate
Authentication.

| --set-client-auth-path
| subject.cn {vbar} san.uri {vbar} san.dnsname {vbar} san.email
| Set SSL client certificate type value.
This field will be used to extract the user name from the certificate.
Currently, only the fields specified in the values column are supported.

| --set-client-auth-prefix
| set_client_auth_prefix
| Set SSL client certificate prefix value.

| --set-client-auth-delimiter
| set_client_auth_delimiter
| Set SSL client certificate delimiter value.
The delimiter can either be a string or a character.
The parsing of the certificate for the user name ends when the delimiter value
is found.

| --client-auth
|
| Show SSL client certificate authentication value.
|===

After setting up the server side for client authentication, you should also
assign the users to some roles on the server side.
To do so:

. Create a user with authentication source (domain) 'Couchbase'.
. Ensure that this user is an internally managed user with a strong password.
While the password is not used as part of the certificate based authentication,
it is required if the user is trying to access the resources through the web console.

== Upgrade

When upgrading to the current version of Couchbase Server from an
earlier, the cluster will continue to return client-certificate
authentication-settings in the format of the earlier version until the cluster
is completely upgraded.
Once the cluster has been upgraded, any existing client certificate
authentication settings from earlier versions are automatically
transformed into the new format.
