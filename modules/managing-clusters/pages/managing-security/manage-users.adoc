= Manage Users

[abstract]
Couchbase RBAC allows defined _users_ to be assigned roles, which permit access to resources.

== Specifying Names

Both role-names and user-names are _case sensitive_.

== Authentication Domains

Couchbase Server assigns users to different authentication domains, based on whether their definition is local (that is, on Couchbase Server itself) or external (that is, by means of LDAP or PAM).

For information, see xref:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

== Creating Users

Users can be created in the following ways:

* With the Couchbase Web Console: See xref:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with the UI].

* By means of the Couchbase CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-user-manage.adoc[user-manage].

For restrictions on username-design, see xref:security-passwords.adoc[Couchbase Passwords].

== Resetting a User Password

A user's password can be set in the following ways:

* With the Couchbase Web Console.
See xref:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with the UI].

* By means of the Couchbase CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-user-manage.adoc[user-manage].

Note that a default Couchbase password policy is provided: this can be modified by the Full Administrator.
See the Couchbase CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-setting-password-policy.adoc[setting-password-policy].

For best practices for password-definition, see xref:security-passwords.adoc[Couchbase Passwords].

== Viewing Users

Currently defined users can be viewed in the following ways:

* With the Couchbase Web Console.
See xref:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with the UI].

== Granting and Revoking Roles

Roles can be granted and revoked as follows:

* *Granted*: With the N1QL `GRANT ROLE` statement.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/grant.adoc[GRANT].

* *Revoked*: With the N1QL `REVOKE ROLE` statement.
See xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/revoke.adoc[REVOKE].


== Creating and Managing Users with the UI

[abstract]
Using the Couchbase Web Console, you can assign roles to users interactively.

== Authorization for Full Administrators

The administrator who initially performs installation and configuration of Couchbase Server — the _Full Administrator_ — is granted read-write access to the entire system.
The user ID of this administrator can be either locally defined, or remotely; for example, by means of LDAP.

Once basic system-configuration has been completed, the Full Administrator is free to add additional administrators to the system, and assign them roles; thereby specifing their access-privileges.

== Adding Users

As Full Administrator, to add _users_ (each of which might be either an _administrator_ or an _application_) to Couchbase Server, use the Couchbase Web Console.
Access the [.ui]*Dashboard*, and left-click on the [.ui]*Security* tab, on the vertical navigation-bar, at the left.
This brings up the [.ui]*Security* view, as follows:

[#security_view]
image::managing-security/securityView.png[,820,align=left]

The [.ui]*Security* view allows users to be defined, and roles to be allocated to them.
It also allows management of the [.ui]*Root* and [.ui]*Client* certificates; of [.ui]*Audit*-processing; of [.ui]*Log Redaction*; and of [.ui]*Session* timeouts.
To add a user, left-click on the [.ui]*Add User* control, at the upper right.
The [.ui]*Add New User* dialog now appears:

[#manage_user_new]
image::managing-security/manageUserNew.png[,380,align=left]


The [.ui]*Authentication Domain* panel features two checkboxes: one specifying [.ui]*Couchbase*, the other [.ui]*External*.
By default, [.ui]*Couchbase* is checked: this means that the user will be defined locally, and that a user-password must therefore be created, using the [.ui]*Password* fields displayed on the dialog.
To define a user externally (for example, by accessing an LDAP server over the network), check the [.ui]*External* checkbox.
If you do so, no password need be specified, since one is assumed to have been defined elsewhere; and the [.ui]*Password* fields therefore disappear from the dialog.

Define a Couchbase user, by adding appropriate entries into the [.ui]*Username* and [.ui]*Password* fields.
The [.ui]*Full Name* field may be left blank.

For more information on defining users locally and externally, see xref:security-authentication.adoc[Authentication].

== Adding Roles

Roles can be specified by checking checkboxes in the [.ui]*Roles* panel:

[#add_new_user_dialog_roles_panel]
image::managing-security/addNewUserDialogRolesPanel.png[,280,align=left]

Roles are arranged in groups.
The first group, which appears at the top of the panel, is for *Administration & Global Roles*: this roles are either administrative, or involve access to cluster-wide features.
Subsequent groups appear below the first: each consists of roles that are applied _per bucket_.
By default, a single subsequent group is displayed, *All Buckets (*)*.
Each individual bucket on the cluster will be represented below *All Buckets (*)*, with its own hierarchy of roles.
This allows each individual user to be assigned roles either that apply to all buckets defined on the cluster, or to individual buckets.
Left-click on the corresponding right-pointing arrowhead to display a group's contents, scrolling down if necessary:

[#all_buckets_checkboxes]
image::managing-security/allBucketsCheckboxes.png[,280,align=left]

To display roles at lower levels of the *All Buckets (*)* hierarchy, left-click on the right-pointing arrowheads.

To assign roles to the user, simply check the appropriate checkboxes.
Then, left-click on the *Add User* button, at the lower right.

Note that some roles are considered to be _subsets_ of others.
In such cases, manually checking one checkbox may trigger the automated checking of others — indicating that the corresponding roles are also assigned to the user.
To demonstrate this, left-click on the [.ui]*Full Admin* checkbox, near the top.
The [.ui]*Roles* panel now appears as follows:

[#roles_panel_admin_checked]
image::managing-security/rolesPanelAdminChecked.png[,280,align=left]

As illustrated, selecting the [.ui]*Full Admin* role causes all other roles also to become selected: this is because [.ui]*Full Admin* stands at the top of the hierarchy, and is a superset of all other roles.

== Saving and Making Changes

Whenever you have finished allocating roles to a particular user, left-click on [.ui]*Add User*.
The dialog disappears, and the [.ui]*Security* view now displays, on the row of the corresponding [.ui]*username*, the roles you have allocated.
For example, if you have allocated [.ui]*Data Reader* and [.ui]*Data Writer* on [.ui]*travel-sample*, the view is as follows:

[#security_view_with_new_user]
image::managing-security/securityViewWithNewUser.png[,720,align=left]

Note that by left-clicking within the row, you display options for editing:

[#security_view_with_edit_options]
image::managing-security/securityViewWithEditOptions.png[,720,align=left]

By left-clicking on [.ui]*Delete*, you delete the user.
By left-clicking on [.ui]*Edit*, you bring up the [.ui]*Edit testUser* dialog, with the options to redefine username, full name, and roles (the content of this dialog is very similar to that of the [.ui]*Add New User* dialog, examined in detail above).
The btn:[Reset Password] button only appears when the selected user is _locally_ defined.
Left-clicking on the button brings up a dialog that allows redefinition of the user's password:

[#reset_password]
image::managing-security/resetPassword.png[,260,align=left]

For a complete account of the roles you can allocate and their significance, see xref:security-roles.adoc[Roles].

== Role-Based Console Appearance

Role-assignment determines which features of Couchbase Web Console are available to the administrator.
Non-available features are not displayed: therefore, the console's appearance changes, based on which roles have been assigned to the current user.
