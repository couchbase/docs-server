== Settings Overview

The _settings_ for Couchbase Server cover:

* _Memory quotas_, _storage modes_, and _advanced settings_ for the
Index and Query services.

* _Software updates_, whereby periodic email notifications are provided
to the administrator, in relation to software-update availability.

* _Node availability_, whereby automatic failover is configured.

* _Email alerts_, whereby users can be notified of critical system-events.

* _Auto compaction_, whereby data on the server is automatically compacted if
specified thresholds are met.

* _Sample buckets_, whereby buckets pre-populated with documents can be
installed, for the purpose of experimentation and testing.

The following subsections explain how to establish settings by means of
Couchbase Web Console.
