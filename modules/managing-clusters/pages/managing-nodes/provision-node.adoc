= Provision a Node

[abstract]
A new Couchbase Server node can be _provisioned_, to establish
its Full Administrator credentials, its service-assignments, and
its memory quotas.

[#understanding-provisioning]
== Understanding Provisioning

_Provisioning_ establishes the Full Administrator credentials for
the server, and specifies its service-assignments and memory-quota
allocations. Provisioning can occur as part of establishing the
node as either:

* The first in a new cluster. Credentials will apply to all other
node subsequently added, as will memory allocations. Service-assignments are
for this node only.

* A new member of an existing cluster. Credentials and memory allocations
are inherited. Service-assignments are made independently for this node.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-initialization]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to provision the same node, so
that it becomes the first in a new cluster, using the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/provision-node.adoc#provision-a-node-with-the-ui[UI],
the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/provision-node.adoc#provision-a-node-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/initialize-node.adoc#initialize-a-node-with-the-rest-api[REST
API] respectively.

The examples assume that the node has _not_ previously been initialized.

[#provision-a-node-with-the-ui]
== Provision a Node with the UI

The Couchbase Web Console is, by default, available on port 8091.
Therefore, if your machine can be identified on the network as `servera`,
you can access the Couchbase Web Console by opening `+http://servera:8091/+`.
Alternatively, you can use an IP address or, if you are working on the machine
on which installation was performed, `+http://localhost:8091+`.
If you have chosen to run Couchbase Server on a port other than `8091`,
connect on that specific port.

Once you have connected, the [.ui]*Welcome* screen appears:

[#welcome]
image::managing-nodes/welcome.png[,400,align=left]

The [.ui]*Welcome* screen lets you either [.ui]*Setup New Cluster*, or
[.ui]*Join Existing Cluster*.
Information on joining an existing cluster is provided in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a
Cluster and Rebalance].
To set up a new cluster, left-click on [.ui]*Setup New Cluster*.

[#set-up-a-new-cluster]
=== Set Up a New Cluster

The [.ui]*New Cluster* screen now appears, as follows:

[#set_up_new_cluster_01]
image::managing-nodes/setUpNewCluster01.png[,390,align=left]

The fields displayed on the screen are:

* [.ui]*Cluster Name*: Your choice of name for the cluster to be created.

* [.ui]*Create Admin Username*: Your choice of username, for yourself: the
_Full Administrator_ for this cluster.
You will have read-write access to all Couchbase Server resources; including
the ability to create new users with defined roles and corresponding privileges.
+
Note that Couchbase Server prohibits use of the following characters in
usernames: `( ) < > @ , ; : \ " / [ ]  ? = { }`.
Usernames _may not_ be more than 128 UTF-8 characters in length; and it is
recommended that they be no more than 64 UTF-8 characters in length, in order
to ensure successful onscreen display.

* Your choice of password, for yourself: the Full Administrator for this cluster.
The only default format-requirement is that the password be at least 6
characters in length.
However, following cluster-initialization, you can modify (and indeed
strengthen) the default password-policy, by means of the Couchbase CLI
xref:cli:cbcli/setting-password-policy.adoc[setting-password-policy] command.

When you have entered appropriate data into each field, left-click on the
btn:[Next: Accept Terms] button, at the lower right.

[#accept-terms]
=== Accept Terms

The [.ui]*New Cluster* screen now changes, to show the
[.ui]*Terms and Conditions* for the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Server:

[#ts_and_cs_01]
image::managing-nodes/TsAndCs01.png[,390,align=left]

Check the [.ui]*I accept the terms & conditions* checkbox.
Then, to register for updates, left-click on the right-facing arrowhead,
adjacent to the [.ui]*Register for updates* notification.
The screen now expands vertically, as follows:

[#register_for_updates]
image::managing-nodes/registerForUpdates01.png[,390,align=left]

To receive updates, fill out the four newly displayed fields with your
first and last name, company-name, and email-address.
Provided that the current node is connected to the internet, the Couchbase
Server version-numbers corresponding to each node in your cluster will be
anonymously sent to Couchbase: this information is used by Couchbase over
time, to provide you with appropriate updates, and to help with
product-improvement.
Your email-address will be added to the Couchbase community mailing-list,
so that you can periodically receive Couchbase news and product-information.
(You can unsubscribe from the mailing-list at any time using the `Unsubscribe`
link, provided in each newsletter.)

You now have two options for proceeding.
If you left-click on the [.ui]*Finish With Defaults* button,
cluster-initialization is performed with default settings, provided by
Couchbase; the Couchbase Web Console [.ui]*Dashboard* appears, and your
configuration is complete.
However, if you wish to customize those settings, left-click on the
btn:[Configure Disk, Memory, Services] button, and proceed as follows.

[#configure-couchbase-server]
=== Configure Couchbase Server

The [.ui]*Configure* screen now appears, as follows:

[#configure_new_cluster_01]
image::managing-nodes/configureNewCluster01.png[,390,align=left]

The displayed fields are:

* [.ui]*Host Name/IP Address*: Enter the hostname or IP address for the machine
on which you are configuring Couchbase Server.

* [.ui]*Data Disk Path*: Enter the location on the current node where the
database files will be stored.
An OS-specific default is provided: here, for MacOS, this is
`/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data`.
The read-only [.ui]*Free* field shows the current amount of free space
for this location.

* [.ui]*Indexes Disk Path*: Enter the location on the current node where
indexes will be stored.
An OS-specific default is provided: here, for MacOS, this is:
`/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data`.
The read-only [.ui]*Free* field shows the current amount of free space for
this location.
+
Note that for a production environment, it is recommended that data and
indexes should _not_ share the same location.

* [.ui]*Analytics Disk Path*: Enter the location on the current node where
indices will be stored.
An OS-specific default is provided: here, for MacOS, this is `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data`.
The read-only [.ui]*Free* field shows the current amount of free space for this location.
* [.ui]*Service Memory Quotas*: A series of fields that allows you to specify how much memory should be allocated to each service you select for both the current node and for each node you may subsequently add to the cluster.
Each service can be selected by checking a checkbox, and then specifying the total number of megabytes to be assigned to the service.
In each case, a memory quota is suggested, and a minimum quota is required.
The sum of all quotas must be within the total amount of available RAM for the current node.

 ** [.ui]*Data Service*: Since you are starting a new cluster, the Data service (which is essential for the cluster) has been allocated with its checkbox disabled.
If this is a development system, you may add up to three services.
Note that on a production system, it is recommended that only _one_ service ever be allocated per node.

 ** [.ui]*Index Service*: Selection and RAM-allocation to support _Global Secondary Indexes_.
This should be 256 MB or more.
If this service is selected, a default quota is provided.

 ** [.ui]*Search Service*: Selection and RAM-allocation for the Full Text Service.
This should be 256 MB or more.
If this service is selected, a default quota is provided.

 ** [.ui]*Analytics Service*: Selection and RAM-allocation for the Analytics Service.
By default, this service appears unselected.
The memory quota should be 1024 MB or more.
If this service is selected, a default quota is provided.

 ** [.ui]*Query Service*: No RAM-allocation is required for this service.

 ** [.ui]*Eventing Service*: Selection and RAM-allocation for the Eventing Service.
The memory quota should be 256 MB or more.
If this service is selected, a default quota is provided.

+
The total memory quota you have allocated is displayed below these fields, towards the right.
The total RAM available is displayed below this figure, at the center.
If your memory allocation is excessive, a notification warns you, and you must lessen your allocation.

* [.ui]*Index Storage Setting*: If the Index Service has been selected, either [.ui]*Standard Global Secondary Indexes* or [.ui]*Memory-Optimized Global Secondary Indexes* can be chosen here, by means of radio buttons.
See xref:understanding-couchbase:services-and-indexes/indexes/global-secondary-indexes.adoc[Global Secondary Indexes], for details.

When you have finished entering your configuration-details, left-click on the [.ui]*Save & Finish* button, at the lower right.
This configures the server accordingly, and brings up the Couchbase Web Console [.ui]*Dashboard*, for the first time.

[#new-custer-set-up-next-steps]
=== New-Cluster Set-Up: Next Steps

If this is the first server in the cluster, a notification appears, stating that no buckets are currently defined.
A _bucket_ is the principal unit of data-storage used by Couchbase Server.
In order to save and subsequently access documents and other objects, you must create one or more buckets.

As specified by the notification, you can go to *Buckets*, and begin bucket-creation; or add a *sample bucket*: left-click on the links provided.
A description of how to create, edit, flush, and delete buckets can be found in the section xref:clustersetup:bucket-setup.adoc[Setting Up Buckets].
An architectural description of buckets can be found in the section xref:understanding-couchbase:buckets-memory-and-storage/buckets.adoc[Buckets].
(There are three different kinds of bucket, so you may wish to familiarize yourself with their properties, before you start bucket-creation.) Note that _sample_ buckets already contain data, and so are ready for your immediate experimentation and testing.

The buckets that you create must be accessed securely: therefore, Couchbase Server provides a system of _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC), which must be used by administrators and applications that wish to access buckets.
Each administrator and application is considered to be a _user_, and must perform bucket-access by passing a username and password.
For information on how to set up RBAC users so that they can access the buckets you create, see xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].

[#provision-a-node-with-the-cli]
== Provision a Node with the CLI

To provision a node with the CLI, use the `cluster-init` command.

The following CLI syntax can be used for initial set-up of a single-node Couchbase Server-cluster.
It allows the establishing of administrative credentials, and of port number.
It adds Data, Index, Query, and Search services; sets separate RAM quotas for
Data, Index, and
Search services, and sets the index
storage-option (the default being to support memory-optimized global indexes):

[source,bash]
----
couchbase-cli cluster-init OPTIONS:
      --cluster-username=USER           // new admin username
      --cluster-password=PASSWORD       // new admin password
      --cluster-port=PORT               // new cluster REST/http port
      --services=data,index,query,fts   // services that server runs
      --cluster-ramsize=RAMSIZEMB       // per node data service ram quota in MB
      --cluster-index-ramsize=RAMSIZEMB // per node index service ram quota in MB
      --cluster-fts-ramsize=RAMSIZEMB   // per node index service ram quota in MB
      --index-storage-setting=SETTING   // index storage type [default, memopt]
----


[#provision-a-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Provision a Node with the REST API

 To provision a node with the REST API, use the

The following REST API examples are used to set up a single-node
Couchbase Server cluster with three services, administrative credentials, and
a RAM quota. Three endpoints are used:

* `/node/controller/setupServices`: Allows services to be assigned, by means
of the `services` flag. Values can be `kv` (Data Service), `index` (Index
Service), `n1ql` (Query Service), `fts` (Search Service), and `cbas` (Analytics
Service).

* `/pools/default`: Allows Full Administrator username and password to
be specified. Also allows memory quotas to be specified. 

*

Set up your administrator-username and password:

[source,bash]
----
curl -v -X POST http://[localhost]:8091/settings/web
  -d password=[password]
  -d username=[admin-name]
  -d port=[desired-rest-api-port|SAME]
----

Set up the index RAM quota (to be applied across the entire cluster):

[source,bash]
----
curl -u username=[admin-name]&password=[password]
  -X POST http://[localhost]:8091/pools/default
  -d memoryQuota=[value] -d indexMemoryQuota=[value]
----

*Examples:*

[source,bash]
----
// Set up services. (Note that %2C is the ASCII Hex mapping to the comma character.)

curl -u Administrator:password -v -X POST http://192.168.42.101:8091/node/controller/setupServices \
-d 'services=kv%2Cn1ql%2Cindex%2Cfts'
----

[source,bash]
----
// Initialize a node. (Note that %2F is the ASCII Hex mapping to the forward-slash
// character.)

curl -v -X POST http://192.168.42.101:8091/nodes/self/controller/settings \
-d 'path=%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fdata&index_path= \
%2Fopt%2Fcouchbase%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fcouchbase%2Fdata'
----

[source,bash]
----
// Set up your administrator-username and password.

curl -v -X POST http://192.168.42.101:8091/settings/web \
-d 'password=password&username=Administrator&port=SAME'
----

[source,bash]
----
// Set up the index RAM quota (to be applied across the entire cluster).

curl -u Administrator:password -X POST  http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default \
-d 'memoryQuota=5000' -d 'indexMemoryQuota=269'
----
