is a system running an instance of Couchbase Server.

== Managing Nodes

A Couchbase Server _node_ is a physical or virtual machine that hosts a
single instance of Couchbase Server. A conceptual overview is provided in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/nodes.adoc[Nodes].
The current section provides step-by-step procedures for node-management.
This includes:

* _Adding_ and _removing_ nodes from clusters.
* Performing _failover_ on nodes, when they need to be removed from
the cluster.
* _Rebalancing_ the cluster, after a node has been removed for scheduled or
otherwise planned maintenance.
