= Remove a Node and Rebalance

[abstract]
Couchbase Server allows a cluster node to be removed, and the remaining
nodes rebalanced.

[#understanding-rebalance]
== Understanding Rebalance

The _rebalance_ operation distributes active and replica vBuckets across
available cluster nodes in optimal fashion. This allows the best possible
data-availability to be maintained after nodes have been added or removed.
Examples of using rebalance after node-addition have already been provided, in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/add-node-and-rebalance.adoc[Add a Node
and Rebalance] and
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/join-cluster-and-rebalance.adoc[Join a
Cluster and Rebalance]. In particular, reference was made in both locations
to the data initially resident on a single node being replicated and distributed,
across two nodes, following node-addition.

Nodes can also be rebalanced following removal: this is demonstrated in
the current section.

[#examples-on-this-page-node-removal]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to remove the same
node from the same two-node cluster; using the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-ui[UI],
the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/remove-node-and-rebalance.adoc#remove-a-node-with-the-rest-api[REST
API] respectively. The examples assume:

* A two-node cluster already exists; as at the conclusion of
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc[List
Cluster Nodes].

* The cluster has the Full Administrator username of
`Administrator`, and password of `password`.

[#remove-a-node-with-the-ui]
== Remove a Node with the UI

Proceed as follows:

. Access the *Servers* screen of Couchbase Web Console, by means of the
*Servers* tab in the left-hand navigation bar. The screen appears as
follows:
+
[#servers-screen-with-node-added-after-rebalance]
image::managing-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalanceCompressedView.png[,800,align=middle]

. Left-click on the row for node `10.142.181.102`. The row expands vertically,
as follows:
+
[#two-node-cluster-after-rebalance-expanded]
image::managing-nodes/twoNodeClusterAfterRebalance.png[,800,align=middle]

. To initiate removal, left-click on the *Remove* button, at the lower left of
the row:
+
[#remove-button]
image::managing-nodes/removeButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
The *Confirm Server Removal* dialog appears:
+
[#confirm-server-removal]
image::managing-nodes/confirmServerRemoval.png[,400,align=middle]
+
Left-click on the *Remove Server* confirmation button. The *Servers*
screen reappears as
follows:
+
[#folowing-removal]
image::managing-nodes/twoNodeClusterFollowingRemoval.png[,800,align=middle]
+
This indicates that node `10.142.181.102` has been `flagged for removal`, and
is `still taking traffic`. A rebalance must be performed to complete removal.

. Left-click on the *Rebalance* button, at the upper right:
+
[#rebalance-button]
image::managing-nodes/rebalanceButton.png[,140,align=middle]
+
Rebalancing now occurs. A progress bar is provided towards the top,
summarizing overall progress. Each row also has its own progress bar,
indicating the workload accomplished by each node:
+
[#rebalance-progress-following-removal]
image::managing-nodes/rebalanceProgressBarFollowingRemoval.png[,800,align=middle]
+
Following the rebalance, the *Servers* screen confirms that a single node
remains:
+
[#single-node-cluster-before-add-node]
image::managing-nodes/singleNodeClusterBeforeAddNode.png[,800,align=middle]
+
Note that all 31.1 K of *Items* (from the `travel-sample` bucket) are
again solely located on `10.142.181.101`, with no replicas (since at least
two nodes are required for replication to occur).

[#remove-a-node-with-the-cli]
== Remove a Node with the CLI

To remove a node from a cluster and perform the necessary rebalance, use
the `rebalance` command with the `--server-remove` option:

----
couchbase-cli rebalance -c 10.142.181.102:8091 \
--username Administrator \
--password password --server-remove 10.142.180.102:8091
----

This initiates the rebalance process. As it continues, progress is
shown as console output:

----
Rebalancing
Bucket: 01/01 (travel-sample)             0 docs remaining
[================================                 ] 31.67%
----

For more information, see the command reference for
xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-rebalance.adoc[rebalance].

[#remove-a-node-with-the-rest-api]
== Remove a Node with the REST API

To remove a node from a cluster with the REST API, and rebalance the
remaining nodes, use the `/controller/rebalance` URI. This requires that
all known nodes be specified, and that the nodes to be ejected also be
specified:

----
curl  -u Administrator:password -v -X POST \
http://10.142.181.101:8091/controller/rebalance \
-d 'ejectedNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.102' \
-d 'knownNodes=ns_1%4010.142.181.101%2Cns_1%4010.142.181.102'
----

The command returns no output.

[#next-steps-after-remove-nodes]
== Next Steps

Nodes can be _failed over_, so that an unhealthy or responsive node can
be removed from the cluster without application-access being affected. See
xref:managing-clusters:managing-nodes/fail-nodes-over.adoc[Fail Nodes Over].
