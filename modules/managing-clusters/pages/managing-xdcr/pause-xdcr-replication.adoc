= Pause a Replication

[abstract]
Pausing an XDCR _replication_ temporarily suspends the replication of data
from the source bucket to the target.

== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to pause the same
replication; using the UI,
the CLI, and the REST API respectively. As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/create-xdcr-replication.adoc[Create a
Replication].

== Pause an XDCR Replication with the UI

*Step 1*: Access Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the
right-hand navigation menu.

This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel, entitled *Remote Clusters*, currently
has the following appearance:

[#ongoing-replications-with-replication]

This shows the single replication that is in progress. Note that the *status*
column displays a status of `Replicating`, immediately adjacent to which is
a pause symbol. To pause replication, simply left-click on this symbol:
