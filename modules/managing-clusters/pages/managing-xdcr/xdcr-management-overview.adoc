= XDCR Management Overview

[abstract]
Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR) provides an easy way to replicate data
from one cluster to another.

[#xdcr-summary]
== What is XDCR?
Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR) replicates data between clusters: this
provides protection against data center failure, and also provides
high-performance data-access for globally distributed, mission-critical
applications.

XDCR replicates data from a specific bucket on the source cluster to a
specific bucket on the target cluster. Data from the source bucket is pushed
to the target bucket by means of an XDCR agent, running on the source cluster,
using the Database Change Protocol. Any bucket (Couchbase or Ephemeral) on any
cluster can be specified as a source or a target for one or more
XDCR definitions.

A complete architectural description of XDCR is provided in
xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/xdcr-overview.adoc[Cross Data Center
Replication (XDCR)]. You may wish to familiarize yourself with
the information provided
there, before performing the routines provided in this section.

== What XDCR Tasks Can Be Performed?

Management of XDCR involves the following:

* _Preparation_: Make sure that you have appropriate permissions for
managing XDCR. Check platform sizes, configurations, and ports. Details
are provided in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/prepare-for-xdcr.adoc[Prepare for XDCR].

* _Reference_ management: Remote clusters must be registered as targets for
XDCR. This requires appropriate administration credentials for the remote
cluster, and the existence on that cluster of one or more buckets that can
be specified as recipients of replicated data. Information on establishing
references is provided in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a
Reference]; and
information on deleting them in
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Delete a
Reference].
