= Monitor a Replication

[abstract]
Statistical information on an XDCR _replication_ can be gathered in real time.

[#examples-on-this-page-monitor-replication]
== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to _fully_ secure a
replication; using the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-ui[UI],
the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-cli[CLI],
and the
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/enable-full-secure-replication.adoc#enable-fully-secure-replications-with-the-rest-api[REST
API] respectively. As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a
Replication].

== Monitor an XDCR Replication with the UI

Information on current XDCR replications is provided by Couchbase
Web Console _per bucket_. Therefore, to check status, access the
*Buckets* screen (rather than the *XDCR* screen).

[#access-buckets-statistics]
==== Access Statistics for Source Bucket

Proceeds as follows:

. Ascertain the name of the XDCR source bucket to be examined.

. In the left-hand navigation panel for the source cluster, left-click on
the *Buckets* tab:
+
[#left_click_on_buckets_tab]
image::managing-xdcr/left-click-on-buckets-tab.png[,100,align=middle]
+
This displays the *Buckets* screen. A single bucket is displayed,
`travel-sample` which is the source for replication.
+
[#xdcr-buckets-row-with-bucket]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-buckets-row-with-bucket.png[,800,align=middle]

. Left-click on the `Statistics` tab, which is located at the right-hand side
of the row for the bucket:
+
[#xdcr-bucket-statistics-tab]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-bucket-statistics-tab.png[,220,align=middle]
+
The *Statistics* screen is now displayed:
+
[#xdcr-buckets-statistics-screen-initial]
