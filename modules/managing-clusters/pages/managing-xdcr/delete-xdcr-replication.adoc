= Delete a Replication

[abstract]
Deleting an XDCR _replication_ stops the replication of data, and removes
the defined replication from Couchbase Server.

== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to delete a
replication; using the UI,
the CLI, and the REST API respectively. As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/resume-xdcr-replication.adoc[Resume a
Replication].

== Delete an XDCR Replication with the UI

*Step 1*: Access Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the
right-hand navigation menu.

This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel, entitled *Remote Clusters*, features
and *Ongoing Replications* panel that currently
has the following appearance:

[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-with-replication]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-ongoing-replications-with-replication.png[,800,align=left]

This features information on a single, currently defined replication.
In the `status` column, this replication is shown to be `Replicating`.

*Step 2*: To delete the replication, left-click on the `Delete` tab, which
appears near the right-hand side of the row:

[#left-click-on-delete-replication-tab]
image::managing-xdcr/left-click-on-delete-replication-tab.png[,180,align=middle]

The following confirmation dialog is now displayed:

[#xdcr-confirm-delete]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-confirm-delete.png[,240,align=middle]

Left-click to confirm deletion. The *Ongoing Replications* panel now
reappears, showing no replications:

[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-after-deletion]

The replication has now been deleted.
