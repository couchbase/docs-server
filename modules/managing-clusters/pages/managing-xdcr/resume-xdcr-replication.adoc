= Resume a Replication

[abstract]
After an XDCR replication has been paused, resuming it restarts the
replication of data
from the source bucket to the target.

== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to resume a
replication; using the UI,
the CLI, and the REST API respectively. As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/pause-xdcr-replication.adoc[Pause a
Replication].

== Resume an XDCR Replication with the UI

*Step 1*: Access Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the
right-hand navigation menu.

This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen.
The lower part of the main panel, entitled *Remote Clusters*, features
and *Ongoing Replications* panel that currently
has the following appearance:

[#xdcr-ongoing-replications-panel-replication-paused]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-ongoing-replications-panel-replication-paused.png[,800,align=left]

This features information on a single, currently defined replication.
In the `status` column, this replication is shown to be `Paused`.

*Step 2*: To
resume the replication, left-click on the start symbol provided:

[#xdcr-left-click-on-resume-replication-button-before]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-left-click-on-resume-replication-button-before.png[,220,align=left]

The start symbol changes back to a pause symbol, and the word `Paused` changes
to `Replicating`:

[#xdcr-resume-replication-button-after]
image::managing-xdcr/xdcr-resume-replication-button-after.png[,220,align=left]

Replication has now been resumed.
