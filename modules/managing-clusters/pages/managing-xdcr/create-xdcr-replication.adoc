= Create a Replication

[abstract]
An XDCR replication allows
data to be replicated continuously from a specified bucket on the source
cluster to a specified bucket on the target.

== Understanding Replications

An XDCR replication is created on the cluster that is to be the source of
the data-replication. Each replication uses a single _reference_, which has
already been created. (See
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a
Reference].) To create the replication, you specify:

* The local, source bucket from which data is to be replicated.

* The remote cluster to which data is to be replicated. This cluster must
already be registered on the local cluster as a _reference_.

* The bucket on the remote cluster to which data is to be replicated.

* The XDCR protocol to be used.

* Whether _filtering_ should be used in replication, and if so, according to
what regular expression.

* Other _Advanced Settings_, which can be used to optimize
replication-performance.

== Examples on This Page

The examples in the subsections below show how to create the same
replication; using the UI,
the CLI, and the REST API respectively. As their starting-point, the
examples assume the scenario that concluded the page
xref:managing-clusters:managing-xdcr/create-xdcr-reference.adoc[Create a
Reference], this being:

* Two clusters already exist; each containing a single node. These are
named after their IP addresses: `10.142.180.101` and `10.142.180.102`.

* Each cluster contains a single bucket, which is the `travel-sample`
bucket.

* Each cluster has the Full Administrator username of
`Administrator`, and password of `password`.

* Cluster `10.142.180.101` now has a reference that specifies its own
`travel-sample` bucket as a source, and the `travel-sample` bucket on
`10.142.180.102` as a target.

== Create an XDCR Replication with the UI

*Step 1*: Access Couchbase Web Console. Left-click on the *XDCR* tab, in the
right-hand navigation menu.

[#left_click_on_xdcr_tab]
image::managing-xdcr/left-click-on-xdcr-tab.png[,120,align=middle]

This displays the *XDCR Replications* screen, the lower part of the main panel
of which is entitled *Ongoing Replications*:

[#xdcr-screen-ongoing-replications-initial]
image::managing-xdcr/ongoing-replications-initial.png[,720,align=left]

The list,
which is designed to show the name and IP address or hostname of each
existing replication, is currently empty, and so bears the
notification `There are no replications currently in progress`.

*Step 2*: To start creating a replication, left-click on the
*Add Replication* button:
