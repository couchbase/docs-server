= Data Bucket Setup

[abstract]
Buckets are used to distribute data across the system.

Couchbase Server optionally creates a [.term]_default bucket_ as part of the installation process.

You can test the system using the default and sample buckets.
However, since these buckets have no password protection you need to remove them in production.

After installing and testing the system, create a new bucket named appropriately and with the specific configuration for your application and then remove the default and sample buckets.
