= Bucket Setup

[abstract]
Buckets are used to distribute data across the system.

Couchbase Server creates a [.term]_default bucket_ as part of the installation process.

While testing with this bucket is fine, it is recommended that you create a new bucket named appropriately and with the specific configuration for your application and then remove the default bucket to save resources.
