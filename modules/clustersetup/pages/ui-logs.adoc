[abstract]
The Log tab  provides a built-in event log and diagnostics collection section.

From the main Couchbase Web Console screen select the Log tab.
Two sub-tabs are available: Logs and Collect Information.

== Logs

The Logs tab displays available logs by the Event, Module Code, Server Node, and Time.
It enables you to identify activity and errors within the Couchbase cluster.

== Collect Information

The Collection Information tab enables you to collect logs and diagnostic information from either all nodes or selected nodes in a cluster.
You can also upload the collected logs directly to Couchbase Support with your data (customer name, ticket number) for easy tracking.
