| Field | Description

| Per Node RAM Quota
| The amount of RAM allocated per-node to this bucket.
If lowering this setting, the provided value can't be lower than the amount of memory currently used by the bucket on any of the nodes in your cluster.
This setting takes effect immediately.

| Cache Metadata Ejection Policy

IMPORTANT: Changing the ejection policy will invoke a bucket restart, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.
| The ejection policy used by a bucket, the two different policies are discussed in xref:architecture:db-engine-architecture.adoc#full-ejection[Tunable Memory with Ejection Policy].



| Access Control
| The authentication policy used by a bucket, if changing this setting you should ensure that all client applications are aware of the new authentication credentials.

| Number of Replicas
| The replication factor of a bucket can be changed at any time, although a rebalance will be required after changing this setting to redistribute the correct number of replica items across the cluster.

| Disk I/O Optimization

IMPORTANT: Changing the I/O priority will invoke a bucket restart, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.
| The xref:architecture:db-engine-architecture.adoc#disk-priority[I/O workload priority] of a bucket can be changed at any time after the bucket has been created.



| Auto-Compaction
| The auto-compaction settings to override the cluster-wide settings as discussed in xref:settings:configure-compact-settings.adoc[Auto-compaction Settings].

| Flush
| This setting enables or disables the xref:bucket-flush.adoc[Flush] command for this bucket, can be changed at any time.

After the bucket creation, you cannot change the following settings:

[#ul_xm5_xwj_yx]
* Bucket Name - Once created, the bucket name cannot be changed.
* Bucket Type - Once a `memcached` or `couchbase` bucket has been created, its type cannot be changed.
* View index replicas - xref:indexes:mapreduce-view-replication.adoc[View index replicas] cannot be enabled/disabled once a bucket has been created.

You can also change bucket settings using the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-edit.adoc#reference_hhk_gmn_ls[bucket-edit] or the xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-parameters.adoc#rest-bucket-change[bucket REST api].
