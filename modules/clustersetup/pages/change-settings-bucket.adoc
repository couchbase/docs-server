The ejection policy used by a bucket, the two different policies are discussed in xref:architecture:db-engine-architecture.adoc#full-ejection[Tunable Memory with Ejection Policy].

The xref:architecture:db-engine-architecture.adoc#disk-priority[I/O workload priority] of a bucket can be changed at any time after the bucket has been created.

IMPORTANT: Changing the I/O priority will invoke a bucket restart, resulting in temporary inaccessibility of data while the bucket warms up.

After the bucket creation, you cannot change the following settings:

* Bucket Name - Once created, the bucket name cannot be changed.
* Bucket Type - Once a `memcached` or `couchbase` bucket has been created, its type cannot be changed.
* View index replicas - View index replicas cannot be enabled/disabled once a bucket has been created.

You can also change bucket settings using the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-edit.adoc[bucket-edit] or the xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-parameters.adoc[bucket REST api].
