= Managing Server Groups

[abstract]
Nodes can be assigned to _groups_, in order to protect a cluster from large-scale infrastructure failure.

[caption=Attention]
IMPORTANT: Server groups and the Server Group Awareness feature are only available in Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

== Creating and Maintaining Groups

_Groups_ can be administrator-defined to contain a number of the nodes within a Couchbase Cluster, and thereby protect the cluster against large-scale infrastructure failure.
An explanation of _Server Group Awareness_, and the effect it has on the distribution of vBucket replicas throughout a cluster, is provided in xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc#groups[Server Group Awareness].

NOTE: When you initialize a new Couchbase Server cluster, the first node is automatically placed in a server group named Group 1.
Once you create additional server groups, the [.uicontrol]*Assign Group* field becomes available when adding new server nodes to the cluster.

To manage groups, left-click on the *Servers* tab, in the left-hand navigation bar.
This brings up the *Servers* screen.
Now left-click on the *Groups* tab, at the upper right:

[#groups_tab]
image::groupsTab.png[,72,align=left]

This brings up the *Server Groups* screen, which might initially appear as follows:

[#groups_server_groups_screen]
image::groupsServerGroupsScreen.png[,820,align=left]

This display indicates that the cluster currently contains three servers.
Note that the list of servers is headed by the name *Group 1*: this is because by default, Couchbase Server puts each new server into a group with this name.
To change the name, left-click on the *edit name* tab, adjacent to the name:

[#groups_edit_group_name_tab]
image::groupsEditGroupNameTab.png[,140,align=left]

This brings up the *Edit Group Name* dialog:

[#groups_edit_group_name_dialog]
image::groupsEditGroupNameDialog.png[,260,align=left]

If you wish to change the group name, edit it within the interactive text-field, and then left-click on the *Rename Group* button.

== Add a Group

To add a new group, proceed as follows:

[#server-grp]
. Left-click on the *Add Group* tab, which is located at the upper right of the *Server Groups* screen:
+
[#groups_add_group_tab]
image::groupsAddGroupTab.png[,120,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
This brings up the *Add Group* dialog:
+
{blank}
+
[#groups_add_group_dialog]
image::groupsAddGroupDialog.png[,260,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

. Access the interactive text-field of the *Add Group* dialog, and enter an appropriate name for the new group.
Then, left-click on the *Add Group* button, to the lower right of the dialog.
The new group is added, the dialog disappears, and the *Server Groups* screen is now displayed as follows:
+
[#groups_server_groups_new_group_added]
image::groupsServerGroupsNewGroupAdded.png[,820,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

Once the information is entered successfully, a new group is added in the [.uicontrol]*Server Groups* page.

== Move a Server Between Groups

Proceed as follows:

[#move-server-grp]
. On the *Server Groups* screen, access the *move to* tab at the right-hand side of the row for the server you wish to move.
A pop-up menu appears, listing the available groups to which the server can be moved.
+
[#groups_access_move_server_tab]
image::groupsAccessMoveServerTab.png[,740,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
In this case, there is only one available group to which the server can be moved, which is Group 2.
Select this group.
A *pending move* notification now appears.
+
{blank}
+
[#groups_pending_move_notification]
image::groupsPendingMoveNotification.png[,740,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

. Toward the upper right of the *Server Groups* screen a *Reset* tab and an *Apply Changes* button have become available.
If you left-click on the *Reset* tab, the pending move is cancelled, and the selected server remains in its current group.
Left-click on the *Apply Changes* button to complete the move.
+
[#groups_reset_and_apply_changes_buttons]
image::groupsResetAndApplyChangesButtons.png[,220,align=left]

. Return to the *Servers* screen.
Note that a rebalance is now recommended, due to the change you have made:
+
[#groups_rebalance_following_move]
image::groupsRebalanceFollowingMove.png[,820,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
Left-click on the *Rebalance* button, to start the rebalance.

== Delete a Group

To delete a group, first remove all nodes from the group â€” either by moving them to other groups, or by removing them entirely from the cluster.
Then, delete the group.
To delete a group by removing servers, proceed as follows.

. Access the *Servers* screen, and left-click on the row for each server you need to remove, in order to delete their group.
This expands the row-display.
The *Remove* button appears at the lower right:
+
[#groups_screen_with_open_group]
image::groupsScreenWithOpenGroup.png[,820,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

. Left-click on the *Remove* button, to remove the server.
A confirmation notification appears:
+
[#groups_confirm_server_removal_notice]
image::groupsConfirmServerRemovalNotice.png[,340,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
Left-click on the *Remove Server* button, to confirm.
+
{blank}
+
A *REMOVAL pending rebalance* notification now appears on the row.
A *Cancel Remove* button is also provided, to allow cancellation:
+
{blank}
+
[#groups_removal_pending_notification]
image::groupsRemovalPendingNotification.png[,740,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

. Left-click on the *Rebalance* button to perform a rebalance, and thereby complete the server-removal process:
+
[#groups_rebalance_button]
image::groupsRebalanceButton.png[,100,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
At the conclusion of the rebalance, the server has been removed.
+
{blank}
+
[#groups_following_server_removal]
image::groupsFollowingServerRemoval.png[,740,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
Perform server-removal in this way for every server in the group to be deleted, until the group contains no servers.

. Access the *Server Groups* screen, by left-clicking the *Groups* button, located at the upper right of the *Servers* screen.
The group that now contains no servers is represented by a row that displays a notification:
+
[#groups_empty_group]
image::groupsEmptyGroup.png[,740,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

. Left-click on the *delete group* tab:
+
[#groups_delete_group]
image::groupsDeleteGroup.png[,100,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
A confirmation dialog now appears:
+
{blank}
+
[#groups_delete_group_confirmation]
image::groupsDeleteGroupConfirmation.png[,260,align=left]
+
{blank}
+
Left-click on the *Delete Group* button.
The group is deleted, and now longer appears as a row on the *Server Groups* screen.
+
{blank}
+
{blank}

== Assign a Group when Adding a Server

When a server is added to a cluster, the server can be assigned to an existing group.
The *Add Server Dialog* appears as follows:

[#groups_select_from_add_server_dialog]
image::groupsSelectFromAddServerDialog.png[,340,align=left]

Select one of the existing groups from the controls that are located at the right of the *Assign Group* field.
