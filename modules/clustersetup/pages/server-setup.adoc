= Cluster Operations

[abstract]
Cluster operations include starting, stopping, adding nodes, and removing the server from the cluster.

WARNING: Never stop or restart Couchbase Server before you first remove that node from a cluster.

The [.ui]*Servers* menu indicates overall server information for the cluster.
Click the server name (IP address) to view the server details such as uptime, operating system, Couchbase Server version, data storage path, and Index Storage path.

* To search through the server list, click [.ui]*Filter* and enter the server name in the field.
* To manage server groups, click [.ui]*Groups*.
For more information, see xref:manage-groups.adoc#mangage-server-groups[Managing Server Groups].
* To add a new server, click [.ui]*Add Server*.
For more information, see xref:adding-nodes.adoc[Adding a Node].

== Limits

Couchbase Server specifies limits and limitations that may affect server usage and implementation.
Depending on the size of the documents passed to the view engine, the performance of Couchbase Server may be affected.

[cols="64,50,139"]
|===
| Limit | Default Value | Description

| Max key length
| 250 bytes
| The maximum length of the document ID (key).

| Max value size
| 20 MB
| The maximum size of the JSON document.

| Max buckets per cluster
| 10
| The maximum number of buckets in a cluster.
See section for information on how to update the maximum number of buckets in a cluster.

| Max view key size
| 4096 bytes
| The maximum size of the key (first attribute) in the [.api]`emit()` function.

| Max doc size for indexing
| 20 MB
| The maximum size of a document that can be indexed.
The default value is set to 20 MB to ensure that all documents get indexed.

In Couchbase Server version 2.x and earlier, the view engine enforced a limit of 1MB on documents that can be indexed.
As a result, when the size of a document exceeded the limit, the view engine (in version 2.x) did not index that document.

| Max key-value size per document
| 1 MB
| The maximum byte size allowed to be emitted for a single document and per view.
This value is the sum of the sizes of all emitted keys and values.

If a document emits a key-value pair that exceeds the specified maximum key-value size per document, an error is logged and that document is not indexed.

| Function timeout
| 1000 ms
| The maximum duration (in milliseconds) to execute all the MapReduce functions in a design document against a single document (map function) or against a list of map values or reductions (reduce or rereduce function).
If the execution time for a document exceeds the specified value, the execution is aborted and that document is not indexed.

| Sub-document path length
| 1024 bytes
| The maximum length of a sub-document path that may be used in one of the xref:java-sdk:common/subdocument-operations.adoc[sub-document] operations.

| Sub-document path nesting level
| 32
| The maximum number of _levels_ a path may reference in xref:java-sdk:common:subdocument-operations.adoc[sub-document] operations.
