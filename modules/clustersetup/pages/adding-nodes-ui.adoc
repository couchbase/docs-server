Install and configure Couchbase Server as per the normal setup procedures.

Using the same method, you can add a server that was previously part of this or another cluster.
During this process, Couchbase Server must be running.

Fill in the requested information:

Server IP Address::
The IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the server that you want to add.
It is preferred that you use FQDNs, especially in a cloud hosting environment.

Username:: The username of the administrator account of the node to be added.

Password:: The password of the administrator account of the node to be added.

Services:: By checking all appropriate check boxes (Data, Query, and Index), you can define what kind of xref:architecture:services-archi-multi-dimensional-scaling.adoc#concept_v4w_zmj_vs[services] will be provided on the
server node that's been added.
You can add one, two, or all three services.

A warning will appear indicating that the operation is destructive on the destination server.
Any data currently stored on the server will be deleted, and if the server is currently part of another cluster, it will be removed and marked as failed over in that cluster.

Once the information has been entered successfully, the node will be marked as ready to be added to the cluster, and the cluster's pending rebalance count will be updated.

IMPORTANT: Once a node is added with a specific service, you cannot change the type of service(s) on that node.
You must remove the node,  rebalance, and then add it back to the cluster with the service(s) of your choice.
