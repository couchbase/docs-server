= Using Automatic Failover

[abstract]
A node or group can be failed over automatically, when it either becomes unavailable or experiences continuous disk-access problems.

== Understanding Automatic Failover

_Automatic Failover_ — or _auto-failover_ — can be configured to fail over a node or group automatically: no immediate administrator intervention is required.
Specifically, the Cluster Manager autonomously detects and verifies that the node or group is unavailable, and then initiates the _hard_ failover process.
Auto-failover does not fix or identify problems that may have occurred.
Once appropriate fixes have been applied to the cluster by the administrator, a rebalance is required.

== Failover Events

Auto-failover occurs in response to failover events.
Events are of three kinds:

* _Node failure_.
A server-node within the cluster is unavailable (perhaps due to a network failure, out-of-memory problem, or other node-specific issue).
+
{blank}

* _Disk read/write failure_.
Attempts to read from or write to disk on a particular node have resulted in a significant rate of failure for longer than a specified time-period.
The node is removed by auto-failover, even though the node continues to be contactable.
+
{blank}

* _Group failure_.
An administrator-defined group of server-nodes within the cluster is unavailable (perhaps due to a network or power failure that has affected an individual, physical rack of machines, or a specific subnet).
+
{blank}

== Auto-Failover Constraints

Couchbase Server applies the following constraints to auto-failover’s handling of events:

* Auto-failover occurs only on the occurrence of one event at a time.
If multiple events occur concurrently, or if a second event follows the first prior to auto-failover’s completion, auto-failover is not triggered.
+
{blank}

* Auto-failover occurs sequentially up to an administrator-specified maximum number of events.
After this maximum number of auto-failovers has been triggered, no further auto-failover occurs, until the count is manually reset by the administrator.
+
{blank}

* Auto-failover is never triggered by Couchbase Server when data-loss might result.
Therefore, even a single event may not be responded to; and an administrator-specified maximum number of events may not be reached.
+
{blank}

* Auto-failover is never triggered when the resulting number of available nodes within the cluster would not constitute a majority of the number available before the problem-occurrence.
For example, if one of three nodes or groups were to go offline, auto-failover could be triggered; but if one of two nodes or groups were to go offline, auto-failover could not be triggered.
(This prevents the situation where functioning nodes or groups, finding they cannot intercommunicate, fail each other over, and then attempt to continue independently of one another, each representing itself as the cluster.)
+
{blank}

Auto-failover can be enabled only when the cluster contains a minimum of three nodes; and should be configured for groups only when a minimum of three groups have been defined.
Additionally, auto-failover should be configured only when the cluster contains sufficient resources to handle all possible results: workload-intensity on remaining nodes may increase significantly.
Auto-failover is for intra-cluster use only: it does not work with Cross Datacenter Replication.

Auto-failover may take significantly longer if the non-available node is that on which the _orchestrator_ is running: _time-outs_ must occur before available nodes can elect a new orchestrator-node and thereby continue.

See xref:settings:configure-alerts.adoc[Email Alerts], for details on configuring email alerts related to failover.

See xref:understanding-couchbase:clusters-and-availability/groups.adoc#groups[Server Group Awareness], for information on server groups and group failover.

== Configuring Auto-Failover

Auto-failover is configured by means of parameters that include the following.

* _Timeout_.
The number of seconds that must elapse after a node or group has become unavailable before auto-failover is triggered.
The default is 120.
+
{blank}

* _Count_.
The maximum number of failover events that can occur sequentially and be handled by auto-failover.
The -allowed value is 3, the default is 1.
+
{blank}

* _Disk Issue Timeout_.
The number of seconds that is the length of a constantly recurring time-bracket against which the rate of read/write failures on a particular node is evaluated.
If 60% of checks during any occurrence of the time-bracket report failures, auto-failover can be triggered.
The default is 120.
+
{blank}

* _Group failover enablement_.
Whether or not groups should be failed over.
A group failover is considered to be a single event, even if many nodes are included in the group.
