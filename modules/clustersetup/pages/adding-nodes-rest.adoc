= Add nodes via REST API

[abstract]
With the REST API, you can add nodes to the cluster by providing the IP address, administrator username, and password as part of the data payload.

Use the [.cmd]`curl` command to add a new node.
If you are adding another service than data, which is the default, specify that service index or n1ql:

----
> curl -u cluster-username:cluster-password localhost:8091/controller/addNode\
      -d "hostname=192.168.0.68&user=node-username&password=node-password&services=n1ql"
----
