= Logging

[abstract]
The _Logging_ facility allows a record to be maintained of important events that occur on Couchbase Server.

[#logging_overview]
== Logging Overview

The Couchbase Logging facility records important events, and saves the details to log files, on disk.
Additionally, subsets of information are provided on the *Logs* screen, in Couchbase Web Console.
This may appear as follows:

[#welcome]
image::loggingScreenBasic.png[,720,align=left]

By default, log files are saved in the following directories:

* *On Linux systems*: `/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`.
* *On MacOSP*: `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs`.
* *On Windows*: `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\logs`.

[#collecting_information]
== Collecting Information

On each node within a Couchbase Server-cluster, logging is performed continuously.
_A subset_ of the results can be reviewed in the Couchbase Web Console *Logs* screen; while _all_ details are saved to the `logs` directory, as described above.
(Note that the  `logs` directory may include `audit.log`.
This is a special log file, used to manage cluster-security, and is handled separately from the other log files.
The information provided throughout the remainder of this page — on collecting, uploading, and redacting — _does not_ apply to `audit.log`.
For information on `audit.log`, see xref:security:security-auditing.adoc[Auditing].)

Additionally, _explicit logging_ can be performed by the user.
This allows comprehensive and fully updated information to be generated as required.
The output includes everything currently on disk, together with additional data that is gathered in real time.
Explicit logging can either be performed for all nodes in the cluster, or for one or more individual nodes.
The results are saved as zip files: each zip file contains the log-data generated for an individual node.

Explicit logging can be performed by means of the Couchbase CLI utility `cbcollect_info`.
The documentation for this utility, provided xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[here], includes a complete list of the log files that can be created, and a description of the contents of each.

Explicit logging can also be performed by means of Couchbase Web Console: on the *Logs* page, left-click on the [.ui]*Collect Information* tab, located near the top.

[#collect_info]
image::collectInfo.png[,248,align=left]

This brings up the *Collect Information* screen:

[#collect_info_screen]
image::collectInformationScreen.png[,720,align=left]

This allows logs and diagnostic information to be collected either from all or from selected nodes within the cluster.
It also allows a *Log Redaction Level* to be specified (this is described in xref:logging.adoc#applying_redaction[Applying Redaction], below).
The *Specify custom temp directory* checkbox can be checked to specify the absolute pathname of a directory into which data is temporarily saved, during the collection process.
The *Specify custom destination directory* can be checked to specify the absolute pathname of a directory into which the competed zip files are saved.

The *Upload to Couchbase* checkbox is described in xref:logging.adoc#uploading_log_files[Uploading Log Files], below.

To start the collection-process, left-click on the [.ui]*Start Collection* button.
A notification is displayed, indicating that the collection-process is running.
When the process has completed, the following information is displayed:

[#collect_info_complete]
image::collectInformationComplete.png[,720,align=left]

As this indicates, a set of log files has been created for each node in the cluster.
Each file is saved as a zip file in the stated temporary location.

[#uploading_log_files]
== Uploading Log Files

Log files can be uploaded to Couchbase, for inspection by Couchbase Support.

For information on performing upload at the command-prompt, see xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[cbcollect_info].
To upload by means of Couchbase Web Console, before starting the collection-process, check the [.ui]*Upload to Couchbase* checkbox:

[#upload_to_couchbase_checkbox]
image::uploadToCouchbaseCheckbox.png[,218,align=left]

The display changes to the following:

[#upload_to_couchbase_dialog_basic]
image::uploadToCouchbaseDialogBasic.png[,302,align=left]

The dialog now features an *Upload to Host* field, which contains the server-location to which the customer-data is uploaded.
Fields are also provided for *Customer Name* (required) and *Ticket Number* (optional).
The *Upload Proxy* field optionally takes the hostname of a remote system, which contains the directory specified by the pathname.

Left-click on the *Start Collection* button.
When collection is complete, a notification provides the URL of the uploaded zip file.

[#understanding_redaction]
== Understanding Redaction

Optionally, log files can be _redacted_.
This means that user-data, considered to be private, is removed.
Such data includes:

* Key/value pairs in JSON documents
* Usernames
* Query-fields that reference key/value pairs and/or usernames
* Names and email addresses retrieved during product registration
* Extended attributes

This redaction of user-data is referred to as _partial_ redaction.
(_Full_ redaction, which will be available in a forthcoming version of Couchbase Server, additionally redacts _meta-data_.)

In each modified log file, encrypted text (achieved with SHA1) is substituted for redacted text.
For example, the following log-file fragment displays private data — a Couchbase username:

[source,bash]
----
0ms [I0] {2506} [INFO] (instance - L:421) Effective connection string:
couchbase://127.0.0.1?username=Administrator&console_log_level=5&;.
Bucket=default
----

The redacted version of the log file might appear as follows:

[source,bash]
----
0ms [I0] {2506} [INFO] (instance - L:421) Effective connection string:
<UD>e07a9ca6d84189c1d91dfefacb832a6491431e95</UD>.
Bucket=<UD>e16d86f91f9fd0b110be28ad00e348664b435e9e</UD>
----

Note that redaction may eliminate some parameters containing non-private data, as well as all parameters containing private.

Note also that redaction of log files may have one or both of the following consequences:

* Logged issues will be found harder to diagnose, by both the user and Couchbase Support.
* Log-collection is significantly more time-consumptive, since redaction is performed at collection-time.

[#applying_redaction]
== Applying Redaction

Redaction of log files saved on the cluster can be applied as required, when performing _explicit logging_, by means of either `cbcollect_info` or the *Logs* facility of Couchbase Web Console.

For information on performing explicit logging with redaction at the command-prompt, see xref:cli:cbcollect-info-tool.adoc[cbcollect_info].

To perform explicit logging with redaction by means of Couchbase Web Console, before starting the collection-process, access the *Log Redaction Level* panel, on the *Collect Information* screen.
This features two radio-buttons, labelled *None* and *Partial Redaction*.
Make sure the [.ui]*Partial Redaction* radio-button is selected.
Guidance on redaction is displayed below it:

[#partial_redaction_selection]
image::partialRedactionSelection.png[,682,align=left]

Left-click on the btn:[Start Collection] button.
A notification explains that the collection-process is now running.
When the process has completed, a further notification appears, specifying the location (local or remote) of each created zip file.
Note that, when redaction has been specified, two zip files are provided for each node: one file containing redacted data, the other unredacted data.

[#redacting-log-files-outside-the-cluster]
== Redacting Log Files Outside the Cluster

Certain Couchbase technologies — such as `cbbackupmgr`, the SDK, connectors, and Mobile — create log files saved outside the Couchbase Cluster.
These can be redacted by means of the command-line tool `cblogredaction`.
Multiple log files can be specified simultaneously.
Each file must be specified as plain text.
Optionally, the salt to be used in encryption can be automatically generated.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ cblogredaction /Users/username/testlog.log -g -o /Users/username -vv
2018/07/17T11:27:06 WARNING: Automatically generating salt. This will make it difficult to cross reference logs
2018/07/17T11:27:07 DEBUG: /Users/username/testlog.log - Starting redaction file size is 19034284 bytes
2018/07/17T11:27:07 DEBUG: /Users/usernae/testlog.log - Log redacted using salt: <ud>COeAtexHB69hGEf3</ud>

----

For more information, see the corresponding man page, or run the command with the `--h` (help) option.
