= Delete a bucket

[abstract]
Deleting a bucket and then recreating it is sometimes faster than deleting all objects in an existing bucket.

To delete a bucket using the Couchbase Web Console:

. Go to the [.uicontrol]*Data Buckets* tab and click the blue triangle next to the bucket name.

. The standard bucket editing screen will appear and in the lower left corner (you may have to scroll down) there is the Delete button in red.
+
Click on it and confirm the deletion.

You can also use the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-delete.adoc#reference_yg2_2mn_ls[bucket-delete] or REST API command xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc#rest-bucket-delete[rest-bucket-delete].
