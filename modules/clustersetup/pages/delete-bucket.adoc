. Click on the btn:[Edit] button.

image::admin/picts/deletebucket2.png[,640,align=left]

. The standard bucket editing screen will appear and in the lower left corner (you may have to scroll down) there is the Delete button in red.
. Click on [.uicontrol]*Delete* and confirm the deletion.

You can also use the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/bucket-delete.adoc#reference_yg2_2mn_ls[bucket-delete] or REST API command xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc#rest-bucket-delete[rest-bucket-delete].
