= Delete a Bucket

[abstract]
Full and Cluster Administrators can delete a bucket.

== Performing Deletion

Bucket-deletion may be appropriate either when an existing bucket is no longer needed; or when all items within an existing bucket need to be replaced â€” and bucket-deletion (followed by bucket-recreation) is determined to constitute a faster process than the deletion of each individual item.

To delete a bucket using the Couchbase Web Console: access the console, and left-click on the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* tab, in the vertical navigation-bar at the left-hand side.

[#access_bucket_tab]

The [.uicontrol]*Buckets* screen now appears, showing the buckets that have already been defined for your system:

[#new_bucket_display]
image::newBucketDisplay.png[,880,align=left]

To delete a particular bucket, left-click on the bucket's row in the UI; then, when the btn:[Delete] button appears, left-click on it:

[#access_delete_button]
image::accessDeleteButton.png[,260,align=left]

A confirmation-dialog is now provided, by means of which you can now either cancel bucket-deletion, or elect to proceed:

[#delete_bucket_warning]
image::deleteBucketWarning.png[,320,align=left]

If you elect to proceed, by left-clicking on the btn:[Delete Bucket] button, the bucket and all its data are deleted from the system; and the bucket is no longer represented within the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* screen of the Couchbase Web Console.

== Using the CLI and REST API

You can also delete a bucket by using the CLI command xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-bucket-delete.adoc[bucket-delete], or the REST API method xref:rest-api:rest-bucket-delete.adoc#rest-bucket-delete[rest-bucket-delete].

== Bucket-Deletion and RBAC

User-access to buckets is controlled by _Role-Based Access Control_ (RBAC).
See xref:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization] for details.

Note that roles assigned to users may contain privileges for accessing specfic buckets by name.
If such a bucket is deleted, all role-assignments to that resource are deleted from the cluster.
