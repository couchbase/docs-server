= Delta node recovery failure scenarios

[abstract]
There are conditions where delta node recovery either defaults to full recovery or is not available.

The following are conditions for delta node recovery failures:

* If topology changes occur while a node is pending delta recovery, delta node recovery is impacted.
For example, another node is added, a node is removed, or a node is swapped.
* If a down node is hard failed over and is marked for removal.
* If rebalance-in-out operations are performed where the number of in and out nodes do not match (swap rebalance works in this case).
* If certain bucket operations are performed while a node is pending delta recovery, delta node recovery is impacted.
For example, a new bucket is added, a bucket's replica configuration is changed, or a bucket is flushed.

The following describes scenarios where delta node recovery either defaults to full recovery or is not available.

Node 1 is in delta recovery and Node 2, an active server node, crashes.::
. Node 1 is failed over and delta recovery is specified.
Now, Node 1 is pending delta recovery.
. Node 2, an active server, goes down.
+
NOTE: The rebalance operation is not available.

. Fail over Node 2.
. Cancel the pending delta recovery, specify full recovery, and rebalance.
. Repair Node 2, add the server to the cluster, and rebalance.

Node 1 is in delta recovery and Node 1 crashes during rebalance.::
. Node 1 is failed over, delta recovery is specified, and the rebalance operation is started.
. Node 1 crashes and the rebalance operation fails.
. Repair Node 1, re-start the server node, and rebalance.
Node1 is added back to the cluster using full recovery.

Node 1 is in delta recovery and a bucket operation is performed.:: The bucket operations that cause rebalance to fail are adding bucket, changing replica configuration, or flushing bucket
. Node 1 is failed over, delta recovery is specified, and then a bucket operation is performed.
. Rebalance is performed and fails.

. Cancel the pending delta recovery, specify full recovery, and rebalance.
+
NOTE: Bucket deletion does not lead to delta recovery failure.

Node 1 and Node 2 are in delta node recovery and Node 2 crashes.::
. Both Node 1 and Node 2 are failed over, delta recovery is specified.
. Node 2 crashes.
. Rebalance is performed and fails.
