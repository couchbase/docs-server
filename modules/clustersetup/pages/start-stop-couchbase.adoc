= Starting and stopping Couchbase Server

[abstract]
Start-up and shutdown scripts are used to manually start up or shut down Couchbase Server.

== Starting and stopping on Linux

Couchbase Server is installed as a standalone application that has a support for running as a background (daemon) process during startup by using a standard control script.
The script is located in [.path]_/etc/init.d/couchbase-server_.

The startup script is automatically installed during installation from one of the Linux packaged releases (Debian/Ubuntu or Red Hat/CentOS).

To manually start Couchbase Server using the startup/shutdown script:

[#ul_ork_dxk_5s]
* For RHEL 6:
+
----
 # sudo service couchbase-server start
----

* For RHEL 7:
+
----
# sudo systemctl start couchbase-server
----

To manually stop Couchbase Server using the startup/shutdown script:

[#ul_bsk_dxk_5s]
* For RHEL 6:
+
----
# sudo service /etc/init.d/couchbase-server stop
----

* For RHEL 7:
+
----
# sudo systemctl stop couchbase-server
----
