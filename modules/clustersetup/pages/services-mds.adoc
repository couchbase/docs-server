= Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)

[abstract]
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) improves performance and throughput for mission-critical systems by enabling independent scaling of data, query and indexing workloads.

== #Anonymous Section#

Historically scale-out and scale-up have been the scalability model for databases.
Both models are useful, and Couchbase and other products take advantage of both models.
However, there are unique ways to combine and mix these models in a single cluster to maximize throughput and latencies.
With MDS, admins can achieve both the existing homogenous scalability model and the new independent scalability model.

== Homogenous scaling model

This model is available through MDS and is simple to implement but has a few drawbacks:

* Components processing core data operations (inserts, updates, deletes), index maintenance or executing queries compete and interfere with each other.
* It is impossible to fine-tune each component because each of them has different demands on hardware resources.
While the core data operations can benefit greatly from scale-out with smaller commodity nodes, many low latency queries do not always benefit from wider fan-out.

== Independent scaling model

Each service zone within a cluster (data, query, and index services) can now scale independently so that the best computational capacity is provided for each of them.
