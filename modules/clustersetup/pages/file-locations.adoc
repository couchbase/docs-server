= File Locations

[abstract]
By default, Couchbase Server stores _data-files_ (supporting _data_, _views_, and _secondary indexes_) in `var/lib/couchbase/data`; with the location of `var` varying on a per-platform basis.
The default data-file path should typically be modified before use in a production-deployment.

== Default File Paths

The full default path for each supported platform is shown in the following table:

.Default paths for data-files
[#table_uyf_wld_dt,cols="1,2"]
|===
| Platform | Default directory

| Linux
| [.path]_/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data_

| Windows
| [.path]_C:\Program Files\couchbase\server\var\lib\couchbase\data_

| Mac OS X
| [.path]_~/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data_
|===

Note that once it has been specified, the data-file path location should not be used to store any data other than that allocated by Couchbase Server; since all such additional data will be deleted.

== Changing the Data-File Path

The data-file path cannot be spontaneously changed on a node that is active within a cluster: therefore, you should ideally apply the correct, permanent data-file path at configuration-time, prior to the node's addition to the cluster.
For this purpose, you can use the [.ui]*Configure Server* screen of the xref:install:init-setup.adoc[Couchbase Web Console], the xref:rest-api:rest-node-index-path.adoc#reference_ywl_gkf_q4[REST API], or the xref:cli:cbcli/couchbase-cli-node-init.adoc[CLI].

If you _do_ need to change the data-file path of a node that is already active within a cluster, select one of the following options:

*Substitute a newly configured node:*

. Configure a new node, with the correct, new data-file path.

. Rebalance the new node into the existing cluster, and the old node out.

*Reconfigure the existing node:*

. Rebalance the node out of the cluster.

. Use the REST API or the CLI to change the data file-path of the removed node.
Note that this permanently deletes all previously stored data.
Not also that the REST API allows data-file and index-file path-settings to be individually changed, whereas the CLI does not.

. Rebalance the reconfigured node back into the cluster.

You are recommended to use the node-substitution procedure, rather than the node-reconfiguration: since node-substitution ensures that cluster-performance is not temporarily degraded.

To change the data-file path on multiple nodes within a cluster, repeat your chosen procedure for each node.
