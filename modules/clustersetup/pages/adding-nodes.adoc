= Adding a server

[abstract]
Add nodes to a cluster via the UI, CLI, or REST API interface.

There are several methods for adding a node to a cluster.
In each case, one or more nodes are marked to be added to the cluster, but it doesn't become an active member of the cluster until you rebalance the cluster.

In a CLI call, the rebalance can optionally be done while adding the new nodes.
When using the UI, rebalancing requires an extra click.

When setting up a new Couchbase Server installation, you have the option to join the new node to an existing cluster.

During the first step, select the [.uicontrol]*Join a cluster now* radio button, as shown in the figure below:

You are prompted to add the following information:

IP Address:: The IP address or hostname of an existing node within the cluster you want to join.

Username:: The username of the administrator of the target cluster.

Password:: The password of the administrator of the target cluster.

The node will be created as a new cluster, but the pending status of the node within the new cluster will be indicated on the [.uicontrol]*Cluster Overview* page, as shown in the example below:
