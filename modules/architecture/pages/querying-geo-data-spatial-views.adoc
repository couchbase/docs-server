= Querying geographic data with spatial views

[abstract]
Spatial views operate in a similar way as incremental MapReduce views.
The request handling, load balancing, and partitioning works the same way as views, and the same staleness parameters are supported as views.

For more information on Spatial views, see xref:querying-data-with-views.adoc[Querying data with views].
