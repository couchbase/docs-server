= Spatial Views

[abstract]
Spatial views are indexed in a similar way as the incremental MapReduce view indexes.
However, spatial views build an R-tree that enables processing of geographic data with multidimensional bounding box type queries.

The architectures of spatial and MapReduce views are similar.
See xref:incremental-map-reduce-views.adoc[Incremental MapReduce Views] for details about the architecture.
