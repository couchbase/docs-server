[#topic16695]
= Monitoring Statistics

[abstract]
Within the [.uicontrol]*Data Bucket* tab, information and statistics about buckets and nodes is displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster.
The information is aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected bucket.

The following functionality is available through this display, and is common to all the graphs and statistics display within the web console.

* `Bucket Selection`

The `Data Buckets` selection list lets you select which of the buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph display.
The statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected bucket.

* `Server Selection`

The `Server Selection` option enables you to limit the display to an individual server or entire cluster.
The individual node selection displays information for the node.
The all server nodes selection displays information for the entire cluster.

* `Interval Selection`

The `Interval Selection` at the top of the main graph changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page.
For example, selecting `Minute` shows information for the last minute, continuously updating.

As the selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long your cluster has been running.

* `Statistic Selection`

All of the graphs within the display update simultaneously.
Clicking on any of the smaller graphs will promote that graph to be displayed as the main graph for the page.

* `Individual Server Selection`

== Individual Bucket Monitoring

Bucket monitoring within the Couchbase Web Console has been updated to show additional detailed information.
The following statistic groups are available for Couchbase bucket types.

* <<summary_stats,Summary>> - The summary section provides a quick overview of the cluster activity.

* <<vbucket_stats,vBucket Resources>> - This section provides detailed information on the vBucket resources across the cluster, including the active, replica and pending operations.

* <<disk_stats,Disk Queues>> - Disk queues show the activity on the backend disk storage used for persistence within a data bucket.
The information displayed shows the active, replica and pending activity.

* <<tap_stats,TAP Queues>> - This section provides information on the activity within the TAP queues across replication, rebalancing and client activity.
* <<dcp_stats,DCP Queues>> - This section provides show information about the DCP connections activity for the bucket.

[#vbucket_stats]
== Monitoring vBucket Resources

The vBucket statistics provide information for all vBucket types within the cluster across three different states.
Within the statistic display the table of statistics is organized in four columns, showing the Active, Replica and Pending states for each individual statistic.
The last column provides the total value for each statistic.

The *Active* column displays the information for vBuckets within the Active state.
The *Replica* column displays the statistics for vBuckets within the Replica state (that is currently being replicated).
The *Pending* columns shows statistics for vBuckets in the Pending state, that is while data is being exchanged during rebalancing.

These states are shared across all the following statistics.
For example, the graph *new items per sec* within the *Active* state column displays the number of new items per second created within the vBuckets that are in the active state.

The individual statistics, one for each state, shown are:

[#outgoing_xdcr_stats]
== Monitoring Outgoing XDCR

The Outgoing XDCR shows the XDCR operations that are supporting cross datacenter replication from the current cluster to a destination cluster.

You can monitor the current status for all active replications in the *Ongoing Replications* section under the *XDCR* tab:

The *Ongoing Replications* section shows the following information:

|===
| Column | Description

| Bucket
| The source bucket on the current cluster that is being replicated.

| From
| Source cluster name.

| To
| Destination cluster name.

| Status
| Current status of replications.

| When
| Indicates when replication occurs.
|===

The `Status` column indicates the current state of the replication configuration.
Possible include:

* *Starting Up*

The replication process has just started, and the clusters are determining what data needs to be sent from the originating cluster to the destination cluster.

* *Replicating*

The bucket is currently being replicated and changes to the data stored on the originating cluster are being sent to the destination cluster.

* *Failed*

Replication to the destination cluster has failed.
The destination cluster cannot be reached.
The replication configuration may need to be deleted and recreated.

Under the `Data Buckets` tab you can click on a named Couchbase bucket and find more statistics about replication for that bucket.
Couchbase Web Console displays statistics for the particular bucket; on this page you can find two drop-down areas called in the `Outgoing XDCR` and `Incoming XDCR Operations`.
Both provides statistics about ongoing replication for the particular bucket.
Under the `Outgoing XDCR` panel if you have multiple replication streams you will see statistics for each stream.

The statistics shown are:

| active vb reps
| Number of parallel, active vBucket replicators.
Each vBucket has one replicator which can be active or waiting.
By default you can only have 32 parallel active replicators at once per node.
Once an active replicator finishes, it will pass a token to a waiting replicator.

| Number of vBucket replicators that are waiting for a token to replicate.

| secs in replicating
| Total seconds elapsed for data replication for all vBuckets in a cluster.

This can happen due to timeouts, due to network issues or if a destination cluster cannot persist quickly enough.

| mutations in queue
| Number of document mutations waiting in replication queue.

| XDCR queue size
| Amount of memory used by mutations waiting in replication queue.
In bytes.

| mutation replication rate
| Number of mutations replicated to destination cluster per second.
