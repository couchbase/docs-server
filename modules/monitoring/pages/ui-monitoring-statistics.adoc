[#topic16695]
= Monitoring Statistics

[abstract]
From the [.uicontrol]*Data Bucket* menu, information and statistics about buckets and nodes is displayed for the entire Couchbase Server cluster.
The information is aggregated from all the server nodes within the configured cluster for the selected bucket.

From the [.uicontrol]*Couchbase Web Console > Buckets* menu, click the [.uicontrol]*Statistics* link for each bucket.
Each bucket page shows different graphs and statistics as explained below:

* *Bucket Selection* - The [.uicontrol]*Buckets* selection list lets you select which of the buckets configured on your cluster is to be used as the basis for the graph display.
The statistics shown are aggregated over the whole cluster for the selected bucket.

* *Server Selection* - The [.uicontrol]*All Server Nodes* selection option enables you to limit the display to an individual server or entire cluster.
The individual node selection displays information for the node.
The all server nodes selection displays information for the entire cluster.

* *Interval Selection* - The [.uicontrol]*Interval* selection at the top of the main graph changes interval display for all graphs displayed on the page.
For example, selecting [.uicontrol]*Minute* shows information for the last minute, continuously updating.
+
As the selected interval increases, the amount of statistical data displayed will depend on how long your cluster has been running.

* *Statistic Selection* - All of the graphs within the display update simultaneously.
Clicking on any of the smaller graphs will promote that graph to be displayed as the main graph for the page.

== Individual Bucket Monitoring

Bucket monitoring within the Couchbase Web Console has been updated to show additional detailed information.
The following statistic groups are available for Couchbase bucket types.

* <<summary_stats,Summary>> - The summary section provides a quick overview of the cluster activity.
* <<server_stats,Server Resources>> - This section provides information on the server resources across the cluster.

* <<vbucket_stats,vBucket Resources>> - This section provides detailed information on the vBucket resources across the cluster, including the active, replica and pending operations.

* <<disk_stats,Disk Queues>> - Disk queues show the activity on the backend disk storage used for persistence within a data bucket.
The information displayed shows the active, replica and pending activity.

* <<dcp_stats,DCP Queues>> - This section provides show information about the DCP connections activity for the bucket.
* <<view_stats,View Stats>> - This section lets you monitor the statistics for each production view configured within the bucket or system.

[#ul_nvf_qfy_yx]
* <<index_stats,Index Statistics>> - This section provides statistics about the GSI Indexes.
Statistics are provided per each individual index.
* <<query_stats,Query Statistics>> - This section provides statistics about the N1QL query service.
These statistics are aggregated numbers at the query service level across the cluster, and are not per bucket or per node.

* <<incoming_xdcr_stats,XDCR Destination>> - The XDCR Destination section show you statistical information about the Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR), if XDCR has been configured.

* *Top Keys* - This section shows a list of the top 10 most actively used keys within the selected data bucket.

For Memcached bucket types, the Memcached statistic summary is provided.

[#vbucket_stats]
== Monitoring vBucket Resources

The vBucket statistics provide information for all vBucket types within the cluster across three different states.
Within the statistic display the table of statistics is organized in four columns, showing the Active, Replica and Pending states for each individual statistic.
The last column provides the total value for each statistic.

image::admin/picts/web-console-server-stats-vbucket.png[,720]

The *Active* column displays the information for vBuckets within the Active state.
The *Replica* column displays the statistics for vBuckets within the Replica state (that is currently being replicated).
The *Pending* columns shows statistics for vBuckets in the Pending state, that is while data is being exchanged during rebalancing.

These states are shared across all the following statistics.
For example, the graph *new items per sec* within the *Active* state column displays the number of new items per second created within the vBuckets that are in the active state.

The individual statistics, one for each state, shown are:

image::admin/picts/web-console-server-stats-diskqueues.png[,720]

The *Active* column displays the information for the Disk Queues within the Active state.
The *Replica* column displays the statistics for the Disk Queues within the Replica state (that is currently being replicated).

[#outgoing_xdcr_stats]
== Monitoring Outgoing XDCR

The Outgoing XDCR shows the XDCR operations that are supporting cross datacenter replication from the current cluster to a destination cluster.

You can monitor the current status for all active replications in the *Ongoing Replications* section on the *XDCR* page:

image::admin/picts/xdcr_ongoing.png[,720]

The *Ongoing Replications* pane shows the following information:

|===
| Column | Description

| Bucket
| The source bucket on the current cluster that is being replicated.

| Protocol
| The protocol version.

| From
| The source cluster name.

| To
| The destination cluster name.

| Filtered
| Indicates if the filtering is set or not.

| Status
| The current status of replications.

| When
| Indicates when replication occurs.
|===

The *Status* column indicates the current state of the replication configuration.
The options include:

* *Starting Up* - The replication process has just started, and the clusters are determining what data needs to be sent from the originating cluster to the destination cluster.

* *Replicating* - The bucket is currently being replicated and changes to the data stored on the originating cluster are being sent to the destination cluster.

* *Failed* - Replication to the destination cluster has failed.
The destination cluster cannot be reached.
The replication configuration may need to be deleted and recreated.

From the [.uicontrol]*Buckets* menu,  click the [.uicontrol]*Statistics* link for the Couchbase bucket to view more statistics for that bucket.
Couchbase Web Console displays statistics for the particular bucket on this page.
You can find two drop-down areas called in the [.uicontrol]*Outgoing XDCR* and [.uicontrol]*Incoming XDCR Operations*.
Both provides statistics about ongoing replication for the particular bucket.
Under the [.uicontrol]*Outgoing XDCR* panel, if you have multiple replication streams you will see statistics for each stream.

[#image_uqx_1kc_mz]

| secs in replicating
| Total seconds elapsed for data replication for all vBuckets in a cluster.

This can happen due to timeouts, due to network issues or if a destination cluster cannot persist quickly enough.

| mutations in queue
| Number of document mutations waiting in replication queue.

| XDCR queue size
| Amount of memory used by mutations waiting in replication queue.
In bytes.

| mutation replication rate
| Number of mutations replicated to destination cluster per second.

| data replication rate

Be aware that if you use an earlier version of Couchbase Server, such as Couchbase Server 2.0, only the first three statistics appear and have the labels *changes queue, documents checked, and documents replicated* respectively.
You can also get XDCR statistics using the Couchbase REST API.
All of the statistics in Web Console are based on statistics via the REST API or values derived from them.
