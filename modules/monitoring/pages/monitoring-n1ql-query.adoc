= Monitoring N1QL Queries

[abstract]
Monitoring and profiling N1QL queries, query service engines, and corresponding system resources is very important for smoother operational performance and efficiency of the system.
In fact, often it is vital for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues such as query performance, resource bottlenecks, and overloading of various services.

Couchbase Server 4.5 introduced system keyspaces to provide various monitoring details and statistics about individual queries and query service.
When running on a cluster with multiple query nodes, stats about all queries on all query nodes are collected in these system keyspaces.

For example, this can help identify:

[#ul_wwm_zlk_3z]
* the top 10 slow or fast queries running on a particular query engine or the cluster
* resource usage statistics of the query service, or resources used for a particular query
* details about the active, completed, and prepared queries
* find long running queries that are running for more than 2 minutes

These system keyspaces are like virtual keyspaces that are transient in nature, and are not persisted to disk or permanent storage.
Hence, the information in the keyspaces pertains to the current instantiation of the query service.
You can access the keyspaces using any of the following:

[#ul_xgz_knt_51b]
* N1QL language (from the cbq shell or Query Workbench)
* REST API
* Monitoring SDK
+
NOTE: All the power of the N1QL query language can be applied on the keyspaces to obtain various insights.

The following diagnostics are provided:

== Authentication and Client Privileges

Client applications must be authenticated with sufficient privileges to access system keyspaces.

[#ul_usw_2nk_3z]
* An Administrator user can access all system keyspaces, and can grant or revoke privileges to and from other users.
* Other non-Administrator users must have explicitly granted privilege called *Query System Catalog* to access the restricted system keyspaces.
For querying details of system keyspaces, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/sysinfo.adoc#topic_2_4[Getting System Information].
* The following system keyspaces are considered _open_, that is, all users can access them without any special privileges:
[#ul_vjw_snk_3z]
 ** `system:dual`
 ** `system:datastores`
 ** `system:namespaces`

== Query Monitoring Settings

The monitoring settings can be set for each query engine (using the REST API) or for each query statement (using the cbq command line tool).
Both settings are actually set via REST endpoints: using the Admin REST API (/admin/settings endpoint) and the Query REST API (/query/service endpoint).

The cbq shell and Query Workbench use the Query REST API to set monitoring at the request level.
The Query Workbench automatically enables the profiling and timings.
It can be disabled using the [.ui]*Preferences* option.
For more information refer to the xref:tools:query-workbench.adoc[Query Workbench] section.

Use the following query parameters to enable, disable, and control the monitoring capabilities, and the level of monitoring and profiling details for each query or globally at a query engine level:

[#ul_zjs_3s4_hz]
* profile
* controls

For more details and examples, refer to the xref:settings:query-settings.adoc[Query Settings] section.

Enabling Settings for a Query Engine::
You can enable profile settings for each query engine.
These examples use local host IP address and default port numbers.
You need to provide correct credentials, IP address, and port details of your setup.

== Monitoring and Profiling Details

Couchbase Server 5.0 introduces a collection of detailed query monitoring and profiling information.
The profiling and finer query execution timing details can be obtained for any query.

[[profile]]Attribute Profile in Query Response::
When profiling is enabled, a query response includes the profile attribute.
The attribute details are as follows:

[#table_gbg_dcp_hz,cols="3,11,8"]
|===
2+| Attribute | Example

2+a|
`phaseTimes` - Cumulative execution times for various phases involved in the query execution, such as authorise, indexscan, fetch, parse, plan, run etc.,

[NOTE]
====
This value will be dynamic, depending on the documents processed by various phases up to this moment in time.

A new query on `system:active requests` will return different values.

	"plan": "11.831101ms",
	"run": "16.892181ms"
}

2+a|
`phaseCounts` - Count of documents processed at selective phases involved in the query execution, such as authorise, indexscan, fetch, parse, plan, run etc.,

[NOTE]
====
This value will be dynamic, depending on the documents processed by various phases up to this moment in time.

A new query on `system:active requests` will return different values.

2+| `phaseOperators` - Indicates the number of each kind of query operators involved in different phases of the query processing.
For instance, this example, one non covering index path was taken, which involves 1 indxeScan and 1 fetch operators.

A join would have probably involved 2 fetches (1 per keyspace)

A union select would have twice as many operator counts (1 per each branch of the union).

This is in essence the count of all the operators in the `executionTimings` field.

| `#operator`
| Name of the operator.

| `#stats`
| These values will be dynamic, depending on the documents processed by various phases up to this moment in time.

A new query on `system:active_requests` will return different values.

| `#itemsIn`
| Number of input documents to the operator.

| `#itemsOut`
| Number of output documents after the operator processing.

| `#phaseSwitches`
| Number of switches between executing, waiting for services, or waiting for the `goroutine` scheduler.

`execTime` - Time spent executing the operator code inside N1QL query engine.

`kernTime` - Time spent waiting to be scheduled for CPU time.

`servTime` - Time spent waiting for another service, such as index or data.

2+a|
* For index scan, it is time spent waiting for GSI/indexer
* For fetch, it is time spent waiting on the KV store
|===
+
These statistics (`kernTime`, `servTime`, and `execTime`) can be very helpful in troubleshooting query performance issues, such as:

[#ul_q3t_l1v_51b]
* A high `servTime` for a low number of items processed is an indication that the indexer or KV store is stressed.
* A high `kernTime` means there is a downstream issue in the query plan or the query server having many requests to process (so the scheduled waiting time will be more for CPU time).

[[plan]]Attribute Meta in System Keyspaces::
This is a new virtual attribute in document metadata introduced in Couchbase Server 5.0.
+
The `meta().plan` captures the whole query plan, and monitoring stats of various phases and involved query operators.
The `meta().plan` must be explicitly called in the SELECT query projection list.
+
The `meta().plan` attribute is enabled only for individual requests that are running (`active_requests`) or completed (`completed_requests`) when the profile is set to timings (`profile ="timings"`) for each individual request.
If at the engine level, the profile is set to off and individual requests have been run with `profile ="timings"`, then the system keyspaces will return the plan only for those requests.
+
Since there may be a combination of profile settings for all of the requests reported by the system keyspaces, not all requests returned will have a `meta().plan` attachment.
+
NOTE: For the `system:prepareds` requests, the `meta().plan` is available at all times since the `PREPARE` statement is not dependant on the profile setting.
+
This attribute is enabled for the following system keyspaces:

* <<sys-active-req>>
* <<sys-prepared>>
* <<sys-completed-req>>

+
For a detailed example, see <<example-2,Example 2>>.

== N1QL Cluster Monitoring

*Description*

Couchbase Server allows you to monitor many aspects of an active cluster, and version 5.0 now has more cluster-aware operations, further diagnostics and more system keyspaces features that cover multiple nodes.
New functionalities specifically include:

[#ul_ih4_5n1_q1b]
* Ability to access active / completed / prepared requests across all N1QL nodes from N1QL.
* Ability to list nodes by type and with status from N1QL.
* Ability to list system keyspaces from system:keyspaces.
* Extra fields in `system:active_requests` and `completed_requests`.
* Extra counters to keep track of specific requests, such as cancelled requests.
* Extend killing request to CREATE INDEX.

*Changes to System Keyspaces*

[#ul_t3f_mpw_q1b]
* `System:nodes` show the datastore topology information.
This is separate from the N1QL clustering view of the world, in that N1QL clustering shows a map of the N1QL cluster, as provided by the cluster manager, while `system:nodes` shows a view of the nodes and services that make up the actual datastore, which may or may not include N1QL nodes.
* The dichotomy is important in that N1QL could be clustered by one entity (e.g.
Zookeeper) and be connected to a clustered datastore (e.g.
Couchbase) such that each does not have visibility of the other.
* Should N1QL be extended to be able to concurrently connect to multiple datastores, each datastore will report its own topology, so that `system:nodes` offers a complete view of all the storage nodes, whatever those may be.
* Ideally, `system:nodes` will provide a way to report services advertised by each node as well as services that are actually running.
* This will be datastore dependent.
* N1QL clustering will still be reported by the `/admin` endpoints.
* `System:keyspaces` can be augmented to list system keyspaces with a static map.
The small disadvantage of this is that it has to be maintained as new system keyspaces are added.
* `System:active_requests` and `system:completed_requests` to report scan consistency.
* `System:prepareds` to list min and max execution and service times, as well as average times.

*cbq-engine-cbauth*

_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 5.0)_

Cbq-engine-cbauth is a new internal user that ns_server uses to allow Query Workbench clients to query across multiple query nodes.

Since Query Workbench can connect to the same node only when cbq-engine is running, Query Workbench cannot do any query-clustered operations.

To get around this block, once the Query Workbench clients connect to a query node, this internal user (cbq-engine-cbauth) will be used to do any further inter-node user verification.

[#vitals]
== Vitals

The [.cmd]`Vitals` API provides data about the running state and health of the query engine, such as number of logical cores, active threads, queued threads,CPU utilization, memory usage, network utilization, garbage collection percentage, and so on.
This information can be very useful to assess the current workload and performance characteristics of a query engine, and hence load-balance the requests being sent to various query engines.

[#sys-completed-req]
== system:completed_requests

This catalog maintains a list of the most recent completed requests that have run longer than a predefined threshold of time.
For each completed request, this catalog maintains information such as requestId, statement text, prepared name (if prepared statement), request time, service time, and so on.
This information provides a general insight into the health and performance of the query engine and the cluster.
Note that most field names and meanings match exactly those of system:active_requests.

[NOTE]
====
Couchbase Server version 5.0 has an extra feature which affects `completed_requests: request profiling` in the following ways:

[#ul_apr_bmc_11b]
* When the feature is turned on, we will store the execution plan with timings to completed requests.
* Profiling information is likely to use 100KB+ per entry.
* Due to the added overhead of running both profiling and logging, we recommend turning on both of them only when needed.
Running only one of them continuously has no noticeable affect on performance.
* Profiling does not carry any extra cost beyond memory for `complete_requests`, so it's fine to run it continuously.

Purging the Completed Requests::
To purge the completed requests for a given time period, use
+
[source,json]
----
DELETE FROM system:completed_requests
requests WHERE requests.time LIKE "2015-09-09%";requests
              WHERE requests.Time LIKE "2015-09-09%";
----

*Configuring the system:completed_requests keyspace*

You can configure the `system:completed_requests` keyspace by specifying the parameters as command line options for the cbq-engine.

* [.param]`completed-threshold`: Sets the minimum request duration after which requests are added to the `system:completed_requests` catalog.
The default value is 1000ms.
Specify [.in]`0` to log all requests and [.in]`-1` to not log any requests to the keyspace.
+
To specify a different value, use:
+
[source,json]
----
curl http://localhost:port/admin/settings -d '{"completed-threshold":0}' -u user:pword
----

* [.param]`completed-limit`: Sets the number of most recent requests to be tracked in the `system:completed_requests` catalog.
The default value is 4000.
Specify [.in]`0` to not track any requests and [.in]`-1` to set no limit.
+
To specify a different value, use:
+
[source,json]
----
curl http://localhost:port/admin/settings -d '{"completed-limit":1000}' -u user:pword
----

You can also set these parameters through the Admin API settings endpoint:

[source,json]
----
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8093/admin/settings'  -u Administrator:pword -d '{ ... }'
----

The JSON parameter accepts two new fields: [.param]`completed-threshold` and [.param]`completed-limit`.

*Example 2*: Completed Request example

Query 1 - First, we set `profile = "timings"` and run a long query which takes at least 1000ms (the default value of the `completed-threshold` query setting) to get registered in the``system:completed_requests`` keyspace:

[source,json]
----
cbq> \set -profile "timings";
cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` ORDER BY name;
----

Query 2 - Now, we change the profile setting to "phases" and rerun another long query:

[source,json]
----
cbq> \set -profile "phases";
cbq> SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` ORDER BY title;
----

Query 3 - Run a query `system:completed_requests` keyspace with `meta().plan`.
The following example shows:

[#ul_amv_vmr_hz]
* `meta().plan` with all detailed statistics collected for Query 1.
* Only profile attribute with all phases-related statistics for the Query 2.
* The profile attribute with all phases-related statistics for this query itself (which is querying the `system:completed_requests` keyspace)
+
[source,json]
----
cbq> SELECT meta().plan, * from system:completed_requests;
